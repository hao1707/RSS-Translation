eBay、Craigslist 和亚马逊上的瓶子售价高达<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/business/sriracha-shortage-huy-fong.html">墨西哥北部</a>特别干旱的地区，那里的许多田地都用<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-26/sriracha-shortage-climate-change-mexico-drought">水</a>灌溉，而科罗拉多河本身就是一种紧张且竞争激烈的资源。但专家告诉我，所有这一切都只是为最后的气候打击做好准备：近年来墨西哥<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150691/la-nina-times-three">遭受</a>了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/02/sriracha-hot-sauce-shortage-mexico-drought">严重的干旱</a>，水库的排水量如此之低，以至于连用于农业的水也基本上被封锁了。<br><br>拉差短缺并不是气候变化引发的最严重的农作物危机。多年来， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/dining/farming-climate-change.html">密歇根州的樱桃</a>一直在严酷的气温下窒息，而<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/01/climate-crisis-us-food-system-five-crops">佛罗里达州的柑橘</a>则被飓风摧毁。印度的小麦作物被<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/india-india-extreme-temperatures-scorch-indian-wheat-production">烤焦</a>，而世界各地的水稻则受到<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/20/climate/rice-farming-climate-change.html">洪水和热浪</a>的双重打击。但现在看到辣椒处于危险之中是它自己的特殊烧伤。辣椒生长于世界上一些最温暖的地区，长期以来一直是耐热性的典范。与许多其他植物相比，它们应该没问题。不过现在，随着酷热和干旱继续袭击地球，“我认为我们会更频繁地看到这种情况，”墨西哥国立自治大学的气候科学家吉列尔莫·默里-托塔罗洛告诉我。是拉差的麻烦可能会成为未来更加无趣的时代的风向标。<br><br>目前，大多数辣椒作物<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/business/sriracha-shortage-huy-fong.html">仍长势良好</a>。加州大学戴维斯分校的胡椒育种专家艾伦·范·迪恩泽 (Allen Van Deynze) 告诉我，在经历了去年夏天残酷的热浪之后，作为西方世界胡椒种植热点之一的加利福尼亚州的几个种植区现在迎来了丰收的一年。就连去年导致墨西哥红辣椒田被毁的干旱状况也已从最糟糕的情况有所改善。辣椒植物很难被压倒。 “除非你的夜晚温度高于 60 度，而白天温度为 80 或 85 度，否则他们会不高兴，”Van Deynze 说。默里-托塔罗洛告诉我，红墨西哥辣椒一直处于辣椒作物歉收的最前沿，因为它们是不寻常的<em>冬</em>辣椒，并且在比其他地方的同类辣椒略低的温度下生长得最好。但与其他一些夏季作物相比，即使是它们的理想状态也相当温和：例如，西红柿的生长温度比辣椒喜欢的温度低 10 度，Van Deynze 告诉我。<br><br>许多辣椒育种者实际上倾向于在作物温度范围的上限附近工作。新墨西哥州立大学的辣椒研究员斯蒂芬妮·沃克（Stephanie Walker）表示，辣椒素是一种让辣椒产生舌头刺痛感的化学物质，它是一种植物防御机制，而辣椒“在压力下会增强防御机制”。告诉我。 “我们对人们说，在经历了充满压力的生长年之后，‘我们将会有美味、辛辣、美味的辣椒’”从另一端出来。一些专家还认为，最好明智地对辣椒用水，尤其是在采摘前几周。南伊利诺伊大学的蔬菜科学家斯图尔特·艾伦·沃尔特斯告诉我，过多的灌溉会稀释水果的味道，因此一些农民会选择少量灌溉。<br><br>但超过一定阈值后，辣椒也会开始发出嘶嘶声。一旦温度达到约 90 至 95 度，传粉者就会停止造访；花朵开始死亡，但不会产生果实或种子。尽管少量的水配给可以缓解辣味，但辣椒——像任何其他生命形式一样——如果得不到足够的液体营养就会死亡。当降雨稀少时，维持许多辣椒种植园的灌溉可以起到缓冲作用，但在极端<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.drought.gov/watersheds/colorado">干旱</a>时期，这些水的配给最终也会受到限制。<br><br>辣椒也不能免受已经困扰其他作物的气候相关问题的影响。地球的逐渐变暖已经消除了冬季的许多寒流，这对于依靠寒冷来减少杂草、害虫及其传播的许多疾病数量的农民来说是一个问题。 “这一点非常清楚：我们看到病毒数量大幅增加，”范·迪恩泽告诉我。此外，热浪和干旱会使植物更容易受到花端腐病的影响，这种疾病会使果实的尖端变黑和死亡。沃克告诉我，由于炎热的天气几乎没有喘息的机会，工人们更频繁地发现自己在危险的条件下采摘辣椒。<br><br>对胡椒生产进行一些调整可能会有所帮助。种植者可以将北美的主要辣椒产区转移到更北的地方，以追求更温和的气温。研究人员还已经在努力培育更多耐旱和耐热的植物，以应对未来更加艰难的岁月。但没有任何保证。基因改造可能很慢，而且有时需要权衡：例如，当育种者选择气候适应能力时，他们必须非常小心，避免失去辛辣味，或改变辣椒的标志性风味，默里-托塔罗洛说。沃克告诉我，仍然存在“生理上限”，超过这个上限，即使是最精心培育的植物也无法生长或繁殖。沃克说，很难确切地说上限在哪里。但作为温暖爱好者中的佼佼者，辣椒可能已经比科学家们希望的更接近了。<br><br>辣椒不会很快从地球表面消失。但即使是少数品种的损失和短缺也会带来痛苦。新墨西哥州的哈奇青辣椒已经面临<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.11/south-agriculture-hatch-green-chiles-are-feeling-the-heat">干旱</a>的压力。默里-托塔罗洛对墨西哥一些特别稀有的辣椒品种的未来感到担忧：黑哈瓦那辣椒，一种产自尤卡坦半岛的花香泥土辣椒； Chiltepin 辣椒，生长在该国北部地区，为海鲜带来柑橘般的滋滋声。他告诉我，当地菜肴现在面临风险。那种独特、独特的味道是“你无法替代的”。<br><br>这就是胡椒产品的吸引力，也是它们最大的弱点。每一种都是对其食谱核心的辣椒品种的致敬，而真正的辣椒爱好者通常并不热衷于替代品。辣椒酱的发酵甜味与参巴辣酱的鲜味不相称；塔巴斯科不能像乔卢拉那样挠痒痒。即使<em>在是</em>拉差酱料类别中，汇丰的许多<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/02/sriracha-hot-sauce-shortage-mexico-drought">爱好者</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/business/sriracha-shortage-huy-fong.html">也对他们最喜欢的品牌的优越性深信不疑</a>。这并不是消费者在购买大米、小麦甚至咖啡时经常遇到的问题。 “如果一个产地的供应量有限，通常会有另一个产地的可接受的替代品，”世界咖啡研究中心的农业生态学家克雷格·克拉夫特告诉我。然而，对于辣椒来说，失去唯一生长的超本地地区的作物可能会导致整个产品线陷入困境。<br><br>任何辣椒的衰落都会伴随着讽刺：这些植物进化出了一种惩罚性的辣味，这显然会给包括我们在内的各种生物带来痛苦；现在我们使世界变暖足以折磨他们。如果我们这个更热的星球最终变得不那么辣，那是因为热武器已经易手。<br><br></div>

Children]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>这部热门的澳大利亚动画片毫不犹豫地以孩子们可以理解、父母也会欣赏的方式探索复杂的情感。 <br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>布鲁伊图片/迪士尼</figcaption></figure>上周，我向妻子提出了一个可能涉及我们许多朋友的问题：“你认为班迪特和辣椒还会再生一个孩子吗？”她想了想，然后摇了摇头。 “可能不会。他们把婴儿床扔了出去，还记得吗？”<br><br>当然。我妻子指的不是她在 Facebook Marketplace 上看到的列表，而是“卧室”，这是澳大利亚儿童节目<em>Bluey</em>第三季中的一集，她和我都看过至少十几次。考虑到我们和两岁的女儿一起一遍又一遍地观看<em>《Bluey》</em> ，我们对《Bluey》的熟悉程度可能比任何其他正在播出的节目都要丰富。但令我惊讶的并不是我们共同的知识，而是我们正在谈论一对卡通狗，就像它们是我们认识的人一样。<br><br>当你有一个年幼的孩子时，你会被动地观看大量儿童电视节目，而我这个沉迷于屏幕的自己会情不自禁地关注它如何提供温和的生活课程或充满活力的情感冲动。但甚至在我女儿出生之前，家长朋友就经常称<em>《Bluey》</em>为儿童节目，比其他节目更胜一筹。三个多季以来，该剧因有关拟人化澳大利亚狗家庭 Heelers 的深思熟虑、有趣的冒险故事<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/12/still-the-best-television-series-in-the-world-bluey-is-back-disney-plus">而</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/08/bluey-disney-plus-parents.html">广受</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/05/bluey-best-kids-tv-show.html">赞誉</a>：爸爸 Bandit、妈妈 Chilli 以及他们的女儿 Bluey（6 岁）和 Bingo（4 岁）。它的许多剧集证实了该剧故事讲述的令人印象深刻的深度，以一种儿童节目真正不需要为成人做的方式奖励我的深入审查。<br><br>大多数剧集（每集大约七分钟）都集中在布鲁伊正在玩的游戏上，通常是与她的家人或她的一些学校朋友一起玩，他们住在一个类似布里斯班的城市，那里居住着各种可以想象的品种的双足会说话的狗。该节目颂扬富有想象力的游戏和 Bluey 的无限活力，因为她的父母尽最大努力跟上她奇特的即兴创作（尤其是 Bandit，他无穷无尽的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/blueys-dad-thinks-hes-so-great">随心所欲</a>的能力让大多数父母感到羞愧）。但游戏并不是一切——角色的描绘足够丰富，以至于我开始认为父母们正在经历和我一样的痛苦。<br><br>在第三季（也是最新一季）的一集《牧羊犬》中，明显劳累过度的辣椒在准备晚餐后，向强盗提出了一个任何家长都可能认识的请求。 “我需要 20 分钟没人靠近我，”她严厉地说，他毫不犹豫地承认了这一点。这个要求让布鲁伊感到困惑，她在这一集中的剩余时间里试图问她的母亲她做错了什么。当然，我们的教训是，一切都没有错——有时成年人只<em>需要 20 分钟</em>。但这是一个比大多数儿童电视敢于尝试的更微妙的前提来构建一集。像<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/07/the-daniel-tiger-doctrine/565187/"><em>《丹尼尔·泰格》</em></a>这样的节目虽然很有帮助，但并没有试图解释父母在日常生活中短暂的疲倦感。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/12/rob-delaney-a-heart-that-works-book-excerpt/672566/">阅读：帮助我垂死的儿子沟通的电视节目</a><br><br>这就是<em>《Bluey》</em>的大胆之处，该剧主要由其创作者乔·布鲁姆 (Joe Brumm) 撰写：它相信年轻观众也能够理解有关父母的缺点和不安全感的故事。第二季的一集名为“爷爷”，讲述了布鲁伊和宾果与脾气暴躁的爷爷一起在澳大利亚丛林中奔跑的故事，同时也讲述了辣椒对父亲年事已高的焦虑，以及他不想放慢脚步的固执。精彩的《粘壁虎》是巴斯特·基顿式的小闹剧，辣椒在努力让她的孩子们出去玩耍时。但它也有一个让我措手不及的随意时刻，正如奇利回忆的那样，当布鲁伊出生时，他们即将去看望的孩子们的母亲给她做了五份烤宽面条。 “这对我来说意义重大！”她感叹道，表达了意外得到一位亲密朋友的照顾所带来的深深的甜蜜，这种感觉是我作为新手父母所珍惜的。<br><br>情感的特异性与肢体幽默的精确度和世界建筑的密度同样重要。 <em>Bluey</em>是地球上任何地方的幼儿都能理解的生动表演，但它也是当代育儿的特殊代表。它是从孩子的角度讲述的，超现实魔法的闪光可以渗透到布鲁伊的现实中，但它也总是非常现实地把任何家庭车辆的后座描绘成完全<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/kateyrich/status/1550106088300740612?lang=en">散落着垃圾</a>。<br><br>上个月在美国播出的最新剧集强调了该剧在构建海勒家族之外的宇宙方面也取得了巨大成功，采用了不同的叙事惯例，并突出了更广泛的群体中的角色。 “故事”这一集重点讲述了布鲁伊在学校的同学以及他们在手工项目中遇到的挫折； 《连体衣》由罗丝·拜恩客串出演，介绍了辣椒的妹妹布兰迪，并间接但有力地探讨了她因无法生育而与家庭的疏远。<br><br>这些叙事转向不一定适合七分钟儿童节目的公式，其中首要任务始终是吸引孩子的注意力（这不是一件容易的事）。<em>布鲁伊</em>做到了这一点，却没有感到自命不凡或粗暴，这简直令人震惊。一系列新剧集已经在澳大利亚播出，虽然我的孩子对我们能看到的大约 140 集感到非常满意，但我已经等不及更多了——不仅仅是为了多样性，也是为了看看电视上最精彩的剧集在哪里。接下来将推出出乎意料的雄心勃勃的节目。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 15:34:48 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-rejects-trump-effort-to-move-new-york-criminal-case-to-federal-court/">因为它在 7 月份的纽约没有起作用</a>，但一旦发生，有两件事是肯定的：它会引起我们的注意，并且会带来拖延的可能性——这是特朗普最喜欢的策略。联邦法律规定，如果州法院开始的起诉涉及“美国任何官员”“以该职位名义”采取的“任何行为”，则可以在 30 天内<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1442#a">“移交”联邦法院</a>。<br><br>根据最高法院长期以来的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/489/121/">判例</a>，这一要求意味着该行为必须涉及该官员的工作表现，并且该官员必须针对刑事指控提出“有色彩的联邦辩护”。从本质上讲，这两个因素将融合在特朗普声称一直代表美国行事、试图改变格鲁吉亚选举结果的声明中。他将辩称，他只是在履行总统的职责，确保佐治亚州依法进行计票。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-georgia-indictment-election/675018/">大卫·A·格雷厄姆：佐治亚州的起诉书提供了全貌</a><br><br>特朗普冒充选举进程的联邦保护者确实很讽刺。特朗普根据驱逐法向联邦法院寻求庇护的历史讽刺也是如此。<br><br>今天的驱逐法规可以追溯到内战前夕。国会颁布了一项前身法规，以<a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Victorshi2020/status/1600283454007955456">该州最红的</a>县之一，这很可能是特朗普的目标，因为他相信陪审团很可能包括无论证据如何都倾向于无罪释放的“永远的特朗普”信徒。<br><br>此外，特朗普可能会任命一位友好的法官来主持审判——从特朗普的角度来看，理想的情况是，他任命自己为佐治亚州北区法官的四名法官之一。此外，他的律师肯定会看到迫使州检察官在一个不熟悉的联邦论坛上进行诉讼可能带来的策略上的好处。<br><br>威利斯可能会出于特朗普采取这一举措的所有原因而反对这一举措。好消息是，她预期的将案件退回州法院的动议最终会获得通过。<br><br>富尔顿县的起诉书指控特朗普以多种方式刑事干预佐治亚州总统选举人的选举。其中最主要的是他在 2021 年 1 月 2 日给佐治亚州国务卿布拉德·拉芬斯伯格 (Brad Raffensperger) 打电话时录制的臭名昭著的录音。在那次电话中，特朗普向拉芬斯佩格<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/us/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia.html">施压</a>，要求他“找到 11,780 张选票”——这超出了推翻总统乔·拜登获得佐治亚州 16 张选举人票所需的数量。特朗普甚至错误地暗示，如果拉芬斯佩格没有“找到”这些选票，他可能会面临刑事指控。<br><br>然后就是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/fake-electors-explained-trump-jan-6.html">假选举人计划</a>。特朗普的 2020 年竞选活动在佐治亚州以及其他六个州进行了竞选活动，目的是在 2021 年 1 月 6 日制造一场虚假的争端，这将导致国会拒绝或推迟对拜登当选的认证。<br><br>这两种形式的干预表明了可能的“罢免”动议的一个主要障碍：无论是他给拉芬斯佩格的电话，还是通过煽动毫无根据的选举人名争夺来阻碍国会会议的阴谋，都不在他作为总统职位的范围之内。 。特朗普显然意识到需要表现出相反的态度，他已经在社交媒体上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://truthsocial.com/users/realDonaldTrump/statuses/109876091900766566">植入了</a>这样的想法，即他的总统职责“确保法律得到忠实执行”包括确保所有 50 个州的安全、可靠和公平的选举。<br><br>即使我们接受特朗普确实担心佐治亚州选举结果公平性的观点，他的主张也存在问题：总统在确保选举中遵守法治方面可以发挥的任何作用背景聚焦于 2020 年 11 月 3 日在佐治亚州进行的选票竞选，其中包括一名美国参议员、14 名美国众议员和一批全州公职人员的选举。但是，宪法和实施宪法的法律刻意赋予美国总统绝对不具有监督作用的唯一一次选举是由选举人团负责的。<br><br>事实上，我们的宪法选举总统的程序明显将现任总统本人排除在外。选举团制度是指各州的总统选举人名单在州议会大厦得到正式认证，并发送给华盛顿，然后由副总统在华盛顿揭幕，并在 1 月 6 日的特别会议上在众议院和参议院进行计票。联席会议。唐纳德·特朗普承诺在该<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/01/trump-capitol-riot-march/">会议</a>上加入他的支持者的行列具有新闻价值，因为它威胁使用暴力，而且因为它违背了宪法明显将总统排除在国会程序之外的规定。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/georgia-path-potentially-prosecuting-trump/621326/">大卫·弗伦奇：格鲁吉亚有非常有力的理由反对特朗普</a><br><br>然而，在给拉芬斯佩格的电话以及相关<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/23/jan6-doj-clark-rosen-donoghue-testimony/">努力</a>中，特朗普甚至没有声称他正在努力确保任何这些下一轮选举的安全、保障或公平。他唯一关注的是自己在 2020 年 12 月 14 日在亚特兰大举行的选举团投票中落败。<br><br>当然，总统职责的概念不包括威胁州选举官员，以使计票结果<i>对总统有利</i>，也不包括让州官员用假选举人名单取代实际选举人名单。正如华盛顿特区的联邦法院在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/politics/judge-ruling-trump-civil-lawsuit-january-6/index.html"><i>汤普森诉特朗普一</i></a>案中裁定的那样，“没有任何宪法条款或联邦法规……授予……总统……与选举团投票认证有关的任何权力或义务。”<br><br>特朗普的免职请求也因第二个独立原因而失败：他无法为针对他的指控提供“有色彩的”联邦法律辩护。虽然“可着色”辩护只是一种<a data-event-element="inline link"

1982 年裁定的那样，即使在损害赔偿民事诉讼中，对这种豁免权的主张——在刑事案件中是否存在任何这种豁免权仍是一个悬而未决的问题—— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/457/731/#tab-opinion-1954625">也不会超出</a>他的职务职责的“外围”以及“其办公室的特定职能”的履行。为了保住职位而监督州总统选举人的选择，这似乎不属于其中。<br><br>除了主张豁免权之外，特朗普可能会辩称，他在给拉芬斯佩格打电话，甚至在假选举人计划中扮演的角色是在行使第一修正案的权利。任何这样的论点都是法律上的废话。这相当于声称法律将利用言语招揽欺诈或盗窃的行为定为刑事犯罪，这是不允许的限制言论自由。既定的法律（和常识）<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/333/178/">恰恰相反</a>。<br><br>三十年前，最高法院<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/489/121/">规定了</a>联邦官员将起诉从州转移到联邦法院的要求。在这样做时，法院依靠“强有力的司法政策”来反对“对国家施加额外的负担”。那里的法院明确承认，将州案件移交给联邦法院就承担着这样的负担。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/january-6-indictment-trump-first-amendment/675012/">艾伦·Z·罗森施泰因：第一修正案并不能为特朗普涉嫌犯罪提供辩护</a><br><br>在最近的记忆中，没有一个案例比这起事件更能体现这种担忧。各州对公平和诚实地选择总统选举人负有主要责任，而它们有权追究那些犯下阻碍选举结果罪行的人的责任，这是最优先的事项。<br><br>地区检察官法尼·威利斯 (Fani Willis) 决心履行法治责任，这体现了公务员不畏惧、不偏袒地履行职责的典范。特朗普的做法是史无前例的，因此需要州检察官的积极回应，对前总统执法。<br><br>特朗普虚假声称一直在尽自己的职责，试图推翻选举，并且仅仅因为他当时是总统而获得豁免，这应该被彻底驳回，他将案件移交联邦法院的努力也被否认。这只是他对法治无休止的攻击的最新篇章，他试图阻止法治适用于他自己，就像适用于我们所有人一样。<br><br></div>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>莫伊塞斯·萨曼/马格南</figcaption></figure>2009 年 1 月，我飞往迪拜，第一次体验了后来被称为“失落灵魂终点站”的地方。迪拜国际机场是世界上最耀眼的机场之一——巨大而现代，充满了奢侈品商店和休息室。但那只是 1 号和 3 号航站楼。<br><br> 2 号航站楼适用于飞往南亚、中亚以及非洲部分地区（如乌兹别克斯坦、索马里、伊拉克和阿富汗）的折扣航空公司。乘客大多是像我一样的贫穷建筑工人、雇佣兵、承包商和记者。<br><br>我是一名公共广播电台记者，多年来一直制作有关阿富汗的报道，但我一直渴望从实地进行报道。当我终于有机会时，我投入了进去。直到后来我才意识到，我是多么忽视了我试图报道的冲突所造成的真正的人类代价。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/08/us-withdrawal-afghanistan-strategy-shortcomings/670980/">阅读：阿富汗本来不必变成这样</a><br><br>第一次访问时，我报道了塔利班利用巴基斯坦部落地区作为训练场的情况。很明显，如果塔利班有一个美国无法触及的避难所（至少地面部队无法触及），那么战争就注定了。我获准驻扎在阿富汗东北部的拉格曼省，塔利班在那里有通往巴基斯坦的补给线。<br><br>我降落在喀布尔，把我的装备拖到尘土飞扬的冬季空气中。喀布尔看起来就像俄罗斯和苏丹的混合体：灰色的天空和零散的树木是莫斯科，破旧的建筑和成群的商贩是喀土穆。一名司机带我向北，经过看似一层又一层的泥屋，上了山。喀布尔到处都是多年来为躲避冲突而逃离各省的人们。许多人不想或不能返回家园，因此他们留下来，挤进非正式定居点。<br><br>我抵达巴格拉姆空军基地，然后飞往芬蒂营地。当我在那里等待前往拉格曼的交通工具时，我与旅长进行了交谈，他毫不含糊地告诉我，安全局势正在恶化，封锁边境是不可能的，如果巴基斯坦提供避难所，塔利班将很难对付击败。<br><br>我本来希望前往拉格曼进行战斗巡逻，但我却被分配与美国政府的一支省级重建小组一起四处旅行。至少它让我能够与阿富汗人谈论他们的经历。道路建设是美国的主要举措之一，反叛乱101。其理论是，铺好的道路会促进经济发展。更大的经济机会意味着人们接受叛乱分子的付款来射击联军或炸毁东西的可能性较小。<br><br>阿富汗人与我合影，我穿着破旧的防弹衣，戴着厚边的防弹护目镜，看起来像个傻瓜。他们对美国表示感谢，对巴基斯坦表示失望。但我经常想知道他们可能在想什么但他们没有说出来。<br><br>我在纳吉尔的一个前哨基地呆了几天。士兵们告诉我，武装分子经常偷偷爬上对方的山脊并向基地开火。一天晚上，他们认为袭击即将发生，并向可疑威胁方向发射了三发子弹。然而，其中一发是照明迫击炮——这是一个潜在的灾难性错误，因为它盘旋在那里，照亮了整个山谷，将基地变成了一个光线充足的目标。<br><br>我们等了又等，但什么也没发生。夜晚寒冷多雨，士兵们解释说，通常发动袭击的武装分子都是“好天气”武装分子——当地人向塔利班支付了几块钱，向基地开枪。冰冷的雨水足以阻止他们。尽管那天晚上没有联系，但对我来说本该显而易见的事情第一次开始变得真实：我身处战区，即使我周围都是最好的军队和军事装备。这个世界，我并不安全。<br><br>我于 2009 年 10 月返回阿富汗，这次是为了报告安全状况和发展努力。我前往东部的加德兹，与美国军队一起建设和视察学校。我跟在一位陆军上尉和工程师后面，他是一位戴着金属框眼镜、留着小胡子的高个子男人。我们走过一所简陋的学校，砖头、砂浆和其他杂物散落在地板上。船长发出了沮丧的低声声音，但周围没有工人受到训斥。几周前，当地人在学校里发现了一枚简易爆炸装置。<br><br>那天晚上我做了焦虑的梦。我不知道该如何看待它们。我没有经历过任何危险的事情，但我开始适应处于一个随时可能发生<i>爆炸的</i>地方的普遍压力水平。<br><br>第二天早上，我搭乘航班前往埃雷拉战斗前哨基地，这是距离巴基斯坦边境约 10 英里的山顶上的一个小型基地。这是观察边界为何只不过是地图上叛乱分子的一条线的理想地点。基地发生了相当多的行动。叛乱分子已经距离基地足够近，可以用小武器进行攻击。<br><br>果然，我刚到不久，附近就发生了爆炸。警报响了，我和几个民政战士一起爬向掩体。安全部队跑到周边的岗位。在狭窄的空间里挤了几分钟后，我们一切都清净了。一枚迫击炮落在基地外，但没有引发交火。当时，我感到非常兴奋，因为我终于可以了解战斗的现实了。<br><br>当天晚上，部队举行野炊活动。他们逍遥自在，开心地把汽油喷在油桶烤架的煤上生火。他们中的大多数人还只是孩子，许多人甚至还没有到喝酒的年龄。 9/11 事件发生时，他们还不到 10 或 11 岁。<br><br>当我像他们这个年纪的时候，我会去参加兄弟会聚会，弹吉他，追女孩，一般来说就是当班级小丑。我无法想象那个版本的我会如何应对前往异国他乡与陌生的敌人作战。<br><br>有一次，当我和几个士兵在小小的胶合板娱乐室里闲逛时，传来轻微的隆隆声和隆隆声——就像有人踩在屋顶上一样。我们面面相觑，思考是否需要做出反应。然后警报从基地广播系统传来。我们去了掩体。 According to soldiers, the explosion had happened about 500 yards from the base—perhaps someone had stepped on an old mine or bungled the planting of an IED, but most likely it was a poorly aimed mortar or rocket.<br><br> A couple of days later I flew to Salerno in Khost province. Like most larger bases, Salerno had a bazaar. It consisted of a couple dozen metal containers that had been converted into shops where Afghans sold rugs, local crafts, and bootlegged DVDs.<br><br> I joined a group of soldiers for tea outside one of the shops. The shop owner, Saeed, a slight man in his late 20s, said that he faced threats for working with the Americans, but no other job paid him enough to support his family. He was frustrated by the corruption of the Afghan government, and he felt that security was getting worse. Just then we heard a loud <i>boom</i> , followed by a quick whistling sound. I caught the second impact out of the corner of my eye. A black cloud of smoke rose from behind a building about 75 yards away.<br><br> Some two dozen people scrambled to the bunker in the center of the bazaar. Nothing had ever landed that close before, people were saying. I spoke with a few of the Afghan shopkeepers. They all said it was the most frightening moment of their time at the base.<br><br> When I walked to the scene, I realized how lucky everyone in the area had been. A tree had broken the fall of the shell. The projectile hit the branches, detonated, and then sprayed a comet tail of shrapnel all over the area. A canvas tent sat about 20 feet from the tree. Seven soldiers had been sitting inside at the time of the impact. Chunks of shrapnel sliced the tent and cut through the interior plywood like it was wet bread.<br><br> I walked through the tent. There were holes everywhere—in the ceiling and floor, in chairs, lights, computer monitors. The soldiers&#39; body armor had been perched on stands in the tent, and several of the vests had been torn by the flying chunks of metal.<br><br> Amazingly, shrapnel hit only one of the seven soldiers. And the injury was so mild that he didn&#39;t even notice it until a few moments after the blast. He walked off to the medical tent under his own power to have the metal removed. Surrounding buildings had several-inch-deep impact craters in their brick and cement walls. The blast had had more than enough force to kill everyone in the tent, and yet it had caused only one small flesh wound.<br><br> Had the tree not been there, the rocket would have landed in the tent and probably killed everyone. If you want any proof that war is a game of inches, well, that was it.<br><br> That night, I again struggled to sleep. The blast replayed in my head. I had to process that anything could happen at any moment. I was on a mission to see and experience war for what it was, but I also wanted to go home in one piece.<br><br> The next day, another close call: While we were on a mission to a village to inspect another construction project, an explosion rang out. An Afghan on a motorcycle had hit the trip wire for an IED that had been planted in the road into the village. The motorcyclist survived the blast, but the IED was not meant for him. It was meant for us—and it had been planted there in the short time that we were in the village.<br><br> The implications were disconcerting. It was possible that on our way into the village we had passed some bad guys who saw an opportunity to plant the IED. It was also possible that someone in the village had tipped off bad guys. Either way, it meant insurgents were camped out in the area and possibly mixed in with the local population. Maybe one of the men the soldiers had just paid for working on the construction site had called about planting the IED. That was the war in a nutshell.<br><br> Had the motorcyclist not hit the IED, our convoy would have. We looked at the blast crater as we drove out of the village.<br><br> I think a lot of journalists, myself included, started out with a false sense of security during embeds. Subconsciously, it could feel like a TV war sometimes—like there was no real danger. However, that bubble had been definitively pierced for me. I knew how naive I had been. And that made me question what it was that I had been seeking in the first place.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/03/biden-afghanistan-exit-american-allies-abandoned/621307/">From the March 2022 issue: The betrayal</a><br><br> That day was the first time I started to think deeply about what I was doing and why I was doing it. Was I chasing firefights because I felt it was crucial to cover and report on them? Or because I had something to prove, because I wanted people to think I was brave? I started to realize it might have been more the latter. Some of it had to do with notions of masculinity, the idea that real men did combat journalism. I realized I had been ignoring the human toll all around me.<br><br> I was wrong to have believed that experiencing combat was the pinnacle of war reporting. As I gained more experience, I began to see how reports from journalists with that attitude tended to be more about how badass they were for being in the thick of the action than about the people who were fighting, suffering, and dying. Many journalists were narcissistic and ambitious. Some were damaged.<br><br> From 2012 to 2014, I reported full-time from Kabul—I was NPR&#39;s last correspondent to be based there. In those years, I reported on the deaths of numerous friends and colleagues as the Taliban began targeting foreign civilians.<br><br> The last year, I was part of a group embed in Helmand when I overheard an American correspondent say, “I&#39;m only happy when I&#39;m being shot at.” In 2009, I might have felt the same, or at least empathized. In 2014, after years of covering conflict, it struck me as about the most defective thing I had heard in a war zone.<br><br> Back in DC, I had difficulty readjusting. One morning, a car bomb went off outside my condo—or at least, that&#39;s what it sounded and felt like. I shot up out of bed and stood pulsing with adrenaline. I looked outside the window and saw no smoke or debris. What I did see were storm clouds gathering. What I thought had been a car bomb was an epic clap of thunder. It took me at least an hour to calm down.<br><br> I knew that I had been altered by years of covering death, destruction, and devastation, but I had no idea how damaged I was. I had no reentry care or support. I felt isolated and had difficulty interacting with friends and family. I made a series of bad life choices. I hit bottom and found the will to keep living ultimately because of my obligation to Squeak. She was a cat I rescued from the streets of Kabul shortly after moving there. I took pity on the dusty little kitten, and she became my battle buddy. Little did I know then that the decision to save her would, years later, save me.<br><br> Two years after the fall of Kabul, I am still processing. I believe it will be years, at least, before we as a country can understand the consequences of the 20 years of war that followed 9/11. And it will take at least as long for me to understand all of the ways I was changed by a doomed war that I felt was likely to fail from the time I first set foot in Afghanistan.<br><br> My experience has brought clarity about one thing: the need to support civilians who work in war zones. Though there is growing support for veterans&#39; mental health, the same cannot be said for the thousands of civilians—journalists, aid workers, diplomats, and others—who also risked their lives to help the people of Afghanistan. Many of them are dealing with the trauma of witnessing combat and its impact, but also with the painful reality that their work made little lasting difference—that the Afghan people are largely back to where they were before 9/11. Among the many lessons we ought to learn from America&#39;s failures in Afghanistan is one we can do something about now: Take better care of one another.<br><br> This essay was adapted from the book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/passport-stamps-searching-the-world-for-a-war-to-call-home-sean-d-carberry/9781956440553?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Passport Stamps: Searching the World for a War to Call Home</i></a> <i>.</i><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:31:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/afghanistan-war-correspondent-changed-me/675005/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/afghanistan-war-correspondent-changed-me/675005/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why People Won’t Stop Moving to the Sun Belt]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Despite the heat, the region&#39;s cities are growing fast.

But as record-breaking heat fries the Sun Belt, the region&#39;s popularity only grows. The numbers, laid out recently in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.economist.com/united-states/2023/07/20/americans-are-moving-to-places-besieged-by-extreme-heat"><i>The Economist</i></a> , are striking: 12 of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2022/fastest-growing-cities-population-estimates.html">15 fastest-growing cities</a> in the US are in the Sun Belt.

Meanwhile, the 50 counties with the <i>lowest</i> heat risk saw their population decrease from migration by 1.4 percent in the same time period. Those hot counties were led by Texas&#39;s Williamson County, near Austin, whose population grew by 16 percent from inbound migration, and where 100 percent of homes have a “high heat risk.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/phoenix-record-excessive-heat-wave-streak/674924/">Read: The problem with &#39;Why do people still live in Phoenix?&#39;</a><br><br> The South may be approaching the approximate ambient temperature of Venus, but that&#39;s no deterrent. People keep wanting to move there. (I count myself among these people, as someone <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/new-housing-affordability-crisis/674679/">who has dedicated</a> the past year of my life to finding a house in Florida.) This unstoppable appeal of Sun Belt cities rests on three factors: These places tend to have less expensive housing, lots of jobs, and warm winters. None of these is sufficient to attract people in large numbers, but together they seem to generate an irresistible force, sucking up disaffected northerners and Californians like a fiery tornado.<br><br> <b>Cheap housing</b><br><br> These days, you don&#39;t have to wonder how the other half lives. You can open up Redfin and see how much house you can get in Dallas for less than your New York rent. The median home price in Los Angeles <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.redfin.com/city/11203/CA/Los-Angeles/housing-market">is $975,000</a> . The median home price in the Phoenix suburb of Chandler <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.redfin.com/city/3104/AZ/Chandler/housing-market">is $520,000</a> . Once you have this knowledge, it can be hard to evict it from your mind. What would you do with an extra half a million dollars?<br><br> The one thing every sunny, growing city has in common is affordable housing. This explains why Los Angeles, with its unimpeachable weather, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/03/california-population-decline-states">is losing residents</a> (including <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/blog/linkedin-workforce-report-july-2023-los-angeles-ca">to Phoenix</a> ). It&#39;s “vastly easier to mass produce housing in the suburbs of Phoenix or the suburbs of Houston than it is anyplace in coastal California or the Northeast,” says Edward Glaeser, an economist at Harvard. Cities in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/housing-in-the-u-s-is-too-expensive-too-cheap-and-just-right-it-depends-on-where-you-live/#2">Northeast and West</a> tend to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/06/california-governor-race-shellenberger-homelessness-san-francisco/661164/">make it harder</a> to get construction permits, and they have zoning requirements that make building affordable housing in desirable areas difficult. Plus, it&#39;s just easier to build on an immense, unending desert than around the mountains of California or in old cities like Boston. In a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13071/w13071.pdf">study in 2007</a> , Glaeser found that in the 1970s and &#39;80s, housing supply increased by 20 percent more in the South than elsewhere in the country.<br><br> In fact, many people seem to end up in the South because they aim for the perfect climate of California, quickly realize they can&#39;t afford it, and settle for a similarly warm, cheaper place, like Phoenix or Austin. Just ask <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-texas-town-52386513">Elon Musk</a> .<br><br> <b>A “business-friendly” environment</b><br><br> Not all hot, affordable places are created equal. Austin became a pandemic boom town, but Midland, a West Texas city that&#39;s just as warm and even less expensive, did not. This is where a complex mix of economic growth, human capital, and a certain yuppie je ne sais quoi<i> </i>come into play.<br><br> The Sun Belt cities that have soared are mostly in states with low taxes, which helps attract businesses. But many are also home to prominent universities that churn out highly educated workers. They&#39;ve successfully created “agglomeration economies” of lots of similar types of companies in close proximity. Austin has the University of Texas, an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-expands-in-austin/">Apple campus</a> , and throngs of upwardly mobile Californians and New Yorkers who have fled high house prices. Midland, well, does not.<br><br> Austin began its strategy of luring tech workers as early as the 1970s and &#39;80s, when UT&#39;s then business-school dean, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://medium.com/texas-mccombs-news/the-kozmetsky-effect-91ef67c4cdf">George Kozmetsky</a> , recruited computing companies to the area and launched incubators to nurture local talent (one of his mentees was a UT student named Michael Dell). Companies tend to cluster near other, similar companies—a phenomenon that explains Silicon Valley in California, Kendall Square in Cambridge, and Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. Knowledge workers like to be near people who can provide them with mentorship and job leads. You might not want to stay at your job forever, so it&#39;s nice to have other companies to jump to. Businesses and educated workers tend to attract each other, and attract more businesses, creating a virtuous circle. In the first year of the pandemic, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Austin-COVID-tech-migration-silicon-valley-16315291.php">Austin had the highest inflow</a> of tech workers of any major city.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/heat-dome-southwest-arizona/674689/">Read: When will the Southwest become unlivable?</a><br><br> Many of the booming Sun Belt cities also possess the seeds of a hip Millennial lifestyle: Live music, outdoor recreation, and interesting bars and restaurants. The newcomers demand even more microbreweries and tapas places, which then sprout up and attract more newcomers. “When the people come, they in turn change the place,” says Cullum Clark, the director of the Bush Institute-SMU Economic Growth Initiative. “The place becomes bigger; it becomes richer; it becomes more cosmopolitan.” And expat Californians tend to like that.<br><br> <b>Warm winters</b><br><br> Walter Bimson, the chair of Valley National Bank and a mid-century <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/2014/06/02/walter-bimson-arizona-icon/9185517/">booster</a> of Phoenix, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Plateau-Conflict-Endurance-Southwest/dp/1559636475/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=9781559636476&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;qid=1690999255&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1&amp;asin=1559636475&amp;revisionId=&amp;format=4&amp;depth=1">once explained</a> that people would surely move to the desert city, because they “want to flee from shoveling coal and from shoveling snow.”<br><br> His hunch—that people love sun—has persisted as a lay explanation for Sun Belt migration, but polling on the significance of weather to people&#39;s moving decisions is sparse. Weather often gets wrapped into a nebulous factor called “amenities” or “quality of life,” which can also include the local schools and crime rates. When asked, many people name better weather as <i>a</i> reason for their move, but not <i>the</i> reason. In 2018 survey data shared with me by the Bureau of Economic and Business Research at the University of Florida, the top reasons people gave for moving to Florida were to be closer to family (37 percent), to start a new job (22 percent), and <i>then</i> the climate or weather (14 percent.) A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/168770/half-illinois-connecticut-move-elsewhere.aspx#1">2014 Gallup poll</a> found that weather was a prominent reason for those seeking to leave Illinois, Maryland, and Idaho, but it wasn&#39;t the <i>top</i> reason for movers from any state. People who moved <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/02/04/as-the-pandemic-persisted-financial-pressures-became-a-bigger-factor-in-why-americans-decided-to-move/#:~:text=In%20November%2C%20a%20third%20of,other%20financial%20reasons%20in%20June.">during the pandemic</a> were likely to cite financial reasons or COVID risk as their motivations.<br><br> Still, it would be weird to ignore the <i>sun</i> in Sun Belt. This is something that all the experts I spoke with eventually conceded—that weather is hard to find in the data behind the Sun Belt&#39;s rise, but it&#39;s also hard to explain away. “No variable better predicts metropolitan-area growth over the last 120 years than January temperature,” Glaeser says. “Everybody likes playing golf in the winter,” says Enrico Moretti, an economist at UC Berkeley. “People really don&#39;t like cold winters,” says Jenny Schuetz, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. People might not always admit it, but they appear to like warm weather.<br><br> Warm winters seem to act as an accelerant on cheap housing and plentiful jobs. People will vaguely consider a place with lots of new businesses and $300,000 homes, but once they see a few hundred Instagram posts of 70-degree February days, they call the moving company. “I think it&#39;s word of mouth. It&#39;s Instagram. A place gets buzz,” says the University of Toronto professor (and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/richard-florida/"><i>Atlantic</i> contributor</a> ) Richard Florida. “&#39;My friends are there. It&#39;s fun. They&#39;re going out to restaurants; they&#39;re going to the beach; winter doesn&#39;t look cold.&#39;” If you can work remotely, why not?<br><br> Chambers of commerce, real-estate agents, and industries that attract workers to warm-weather states tend to play up the “golf in the winter” element and play down the “lava-hot July.” “January, February, and March are the three reasons why people were attracted” to the Sun Belt, says Andrew Ross, a professor at NYU who has written several books about Sun Belt cities. “Housing-industry developers, real-estate brokers, they don&#39;t talk about the summers. They talk about January, February, and March.”<br><br> <b>A Sun Belt tipping point?</b><br><br> That said, all of these new Arizonans and Texans might leave if their cities continue heating and also escape the realm of affordability. There&#39;s already an exodus afoot from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/miami-sees-its-first-population-drop-in-decades-e181171f">Miami</a> , for instance. The conservative governors of some Sun Belt states likely don&#39;t appeal to the creative, liberal types who are drawn to cities. “Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a gay designer who moved to Miami. Now you look up and you see Ron DeSantis,” Richard Florida says. “And you go, <i>What the fuck am I doing here?</i> ”<br><br> <a href="http://v/">Read: Summer in the South is becoming unbearable</a><br><br> Florida thinks the next great migration, for both climate and affordability reasons, will be north. Midwestern towns that can offer good amenities without scorching summers, such as Madison or Pittsburgh, are poised to offer a Sun Belt alternative. The Midwest currently has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wispolicyforum.org/research/worker-incentives-gaining-popularity-in-midwest-but-still-rare-in-wisconsin/">the most</a> worker-relocation incentive programs, which pay remote workers to move to an underpopulated city. (Indiana alone has 16.) Or people might migrate to slightly cooler parts of warm states, choosing Flagstaff over Phoenix. (This is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/wp2023-17.pdf">already happening</a> , to some extent.)<br><br> For now, though, climatologists&#39; dire predictions don&#39;t seem to be fazing people. Sure, Texans would prefer for it to be cooler, but the heat is apparently just this side of tolerable. Many residents of Phoenix and Dallas spend their summer days rotating between air-conditioned houses, air-conditioned cars, and air-conditioned offices, minimizing the felt impact of the triple-digit heat. “The fact that people are moving more into climate-risky places, and away from lower-risk places, suggests either that climate risk isn&#39;t a primary factor that&#39;s driving this, or that something else, like the cost of housing, is weighing out more than the climate risks,” Schuetz says. Knowledge of flood risk can nudge people toward lower-risk homes, according to a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.redfin.com/news/redfin-users-interact-with-flood-risk-data/">study by Redfin</a> , but it&#39;s unclear if this is true for more widespread climate risks, like heat. What&#39;s the “safer” house if 100 percent of a county has a high heat risk?<br><br> It would be unfair to write off people moving to the Sun Belt as irrational or ignorant. We would all love a cheap house and a good job in a city that&#39;s just warm enough. But life involves compromise. There aren&#39;t enough houses in California. There aren&#39;t enough jobs in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/13/unemployment-rate-us-cities">Cleveland</a> . Sometimes the best you can afford is Phoenix. “We can&#39;t tell them not to move there,” Schuetz says, “unless we make it feasible for them to live in other places that are lower risk.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/moving-south-sun-belt-housing-economy/675010/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/moving-south-sun-belt-housing-economy/675010/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Agony of Mike Pence]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Why does he think the people who wanted to kill him will vote for him? <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/jF9ozq0BPr5cPlfJAgte_NQTCEs=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/pence/original.jpg" alt="迈克·彭斯的特写照片" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Jonathan Ernst / Reuters</figcaption></figure> H <span class="smallcaps">ere is a theory</span> I cannot test, but which I believe to be true:<br><br> If Mike Pence were to walk through the crowd at a Donald Trump rally—for instance, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/01/trump-rally-south-carolina-00104526">the recent giant event</a> where 50,000 Trump supporters swamped the town of Pickens, South Carolina—he would need a security detail. He would not be safe without one, and he might not be safe <em>with</em> one either. In fact, I have a hard time believing that any Secret Service team would agree to go along with such an excursion.

Last: Mike Pence is an American hero</a><br><br> Not to belabor the obvious, but, for Pence, this is a problem. Because Pence is running for president as a Republican.<br><br> Yet for the country, this isn&#39;t just a problem; it&#39;s an almost biblical tragedy. Mike Pence is the man who told his tribe the truth. They turned on him for it. And now, having finally found the courage to leave, he&#39;s desperate for acceptance among them once again.<br><br> F <span class="smallcaps">or more than</span> a quarter century, Pence was a dutiful and committed conservative. He started in talk radio, where his brand was “Rush Limbaugh on decaf.” On his third try, he got himself elected to the House of Representatives, where he was happy to buck the Republican Party by opposing George W. Bush on two of his big legislative achievements—No Child Left Behind and Medicare expansion—both of which Pence believed violated his commitment to certain small-government conservative principles. But Republicans forgave these heresies. Pence ascended to the No. 3 position in House GOP leadership.<br><br> From the House, Pence vaulted to the Indiana governor&#39;s mansion and then, finally, onto a presidential ticket as Trump&#39;s running mate. You know how that went: For four years, Pence defended everything Trump did and said. Behind the scenes, he tried to be the grown-up in the room. A fly camped out on his face on national TV. Yada yada yada, then came the coup.<br><br> At which point, Trump instructed several thousand of his supporters to march to the US Capitol “with strength” and prevent Pence from performing his constitutional duty to count and certify electoral votes—which would officially make Biden the president-elect. So a bunch of very fine people who had recently voted to make Pence vice president walked down Constitution Avenue, erected a gallows, and stormed the Capitol. During the course of these events, many raised their voices to chant, “Hang Mike Pence.”<br><br> F <span class="smallcaps">or his part,</span> Pence is sanguine about this unpleasantness. Last month, when asked about Trump&#39;s latest threat—that it would be “very dangerous” for America if he were convicted of crimes—he waved away the possibility. “Everyone in our movement are the kind of Americans who love this country, are patriotic or law-and-order people who would never have done anything like that there or anywhere else,” Pence <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/07/23/mike-pence-reacts-to-donald-trump-very-dangerous-sot-bash-sotu-vpx.cnn">told</a> CNN&#39;s Dana Bash.<br><br> Bash was brought up short. “That&#39;s pretty remarkable that you&#39;re not concerned about it, given the fact that they wanted to hang you on January 6,” she said.<br><br> Pence responded, “The people in this movement, the people who rallied behind our cause in 2016 and 2020, are the most God-fearing, law-abiding, patriotic people in this country, and I … won&#39;t stand for those kinds of generalizations, because they have no basis in fact.”<br><br> Never in American politics has a candidate so dutifully followed the instruction of Jesus: “To one who strikes you on the cheek, offer the other also.” So whatever you want to say about Mike Pence, I&#39;ll bet that if a bunch of MAGA Proud Boys demanded his tunic, he&#39;d offer them his cloak too. God bless him.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n other ways,</span> Pence reminds me of an Old Testament figure, one of the prophets who told the Israelites news they didn&#39;t want to hear—but stuck around anyway, reviled by the people he was trying to save.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/gods-plan-for-mike-pence/546569/">January/February 2018 Issue: God&#39;s plan for Mike Pence</a><br><br> A few weeks ago, Pence attended a town-hall event in Iowa sponsored by the Family Leader. It was an evangelical-forward gathering attended by the kind of midwestern conservative Christians who have been Pence&#39;s people since he was in short pants. Tucker Carlson, the event&#39;s moderator, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?529323-4/mike-pence-speaks-2023-family-leadership-summit">tore</a> into Pence both for his refusal to overturn the 2020 election and for his hawkish support of military aid to Ukraine. Pence stood up to Carlson and held to his conservative convictions.<br><br> And so, given the choice between a TV presenter who has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/business/media/tucker-carlson-trump.html">privately</a> talked about how he hates Trump “passionately” and Trump&#39;s own vice president—a man who has dutifully served conservative causes in government for a generation and who stood by Trump for <em>everything</em> except overthrowing American democracy, the evangelicals … cheered for Tucker and booed Pence.<br><br> Give us Barabbas.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he rest</span> of America doesn&#39;t quite know what to do with Pence. He&#39;s a complicated figure.<br><br> On the one hand, he tolerated and defended all of the depredations of the Trump years. By vouching for Trump with evangelical voters in 2016, he cemented Trump&#39;s takeover of the party. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/16/mike-pence-supports-trump-charlottesville-241708">stood by</a> Trump after Charlottesville, Virginia. He was Trump&#39;s rock during the first impeachment. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/good-cop-bad-cop-trump-pence-dynamic-coronavirus/story?id=70043623">tried</a> to clean up the worst parts of Trump&#39;s mishandling of COVID while being at pains to praise Trump for doing a heroic job. He was a loyal running mate in 2020. He did all of this with his eyes wide open.<br><br> On the other hand, at the moment when Trump attempted to thwart the peaceful transition of power, Pence was the only man standing between the Constitution and collapse. After a full term of cowardice, he displayed courage in the moment it mattered most. If he hadn&#39;t followed the law on January 6, there is no telling what would have happened.<br><br> Some people maintain that Pence does not deserve credit simply for <em>not breaking the law</em> . I sympathize. I did not rob a bank this morning—do I get a cookie? But ultimately, I find Pence&#39;s heroism in the performance of his duty too great to wave away. He faced physical and professional risk on January 6; his career, his life, and the lives of his family were imperiled. He risked all of that to follow the law. It is nice to think that we all would have done the same, but I&#39;m not sure. And I <em>am</em> sure that the overwhelming majority of Pence&#39;s fellow Republicans would not have.<br><br> Further, Pence is one of only three Republicans running for president who consistently speaks straightforwardly about January 6 and the rule of law, and he does not couch his criticisms of Trump as merely being “bad for Republican chances to win.” Pence possesses much of what the prodemocracy movement hopes for in a Republican. In some ways, he is an example of what, in the small- <em>d</em> democratic sense, a Republican Party aiming to restore itself to health and liberalism should look like.<br><br> It is precisely because of this that Pence is so reviled by so many Republicans, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3872">a favorability rating that barely breaks even</a> .<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">t turns out</span> that Pence doesn&#39;t quite know what to do with himself either. So he&#39;s trying his luck at becoming the avatar of the same voters who wanted to hang him.<br><br> It&#39;s the damnedest thing. Pence overcame a lifetime of political tribalism to break with his team. And now he&#39;s trying to get back on it—because he can&#39;t see what he helped them become.<br><br> One of my pet theories is that during the Trump years, we discovered that our political spectrum had two axes. There&#39;s the left–right, progressive–conservative x-axis that we&#39;re all familiar with. But there&#39;s also an up–down, liberal–illiberal y-axis. This has been the case in America for a long time—since its founding, really—but with the end of Jim Crow, a lot of us had forgotten that this y-axis existed. We assumed that everyone on the conservative, right-hand side of the x-axis—the Reagans, the Bushes, the Doles, the McCains, the Romneys—was also at the top (the liberal end) of the y-axis, too. Because they were.<br><br> But with Trump&#39;s emergence, some people—both voters and elected officials—began drifting downward on that y-axis toward the illiberal side of the spectrum.<br><br> Pence was happy to play along until the chips were down, at which point he chose liberalism and democracy. And for that, America owes him a debt that can never be repaid.<br><br> The tragedy of Pence is that, for all of his x-axis conservative policy views, it&#39;s his conviction in favor of liberalism on the y-axis that now matters most to the conservatives he is asking to vote for him.<br><br> A liberal society can have arguments about tax rates and infrastructure spending and foreign policy. In an illiberal society, none of those questions really matters—the only thing that matters is who holds power. “Who, whom?” as the Leninists used to put it.<br><br> On the biggest issues—democracy, the Constitution, the rule of law—Mike Pence is now much closer to Joe Biden on the y-axis than he is to Republican voters.<br><br> And he either can&#39;t see it, or won&#39;t.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/mike-pence-republican-candidate/674981/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/mike-pence-republican-candidate/674981/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[These State Schools Also Favor the One Percent]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Some of the universities that cater most egregiously to wealthy students turn out to be public. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ank0xqXAL8MBHDEJcjS_MC1qlRs=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/Public_University_Admissions_Wealth_3/original.jpg" alt="大学教室的座位上铺满了申请问题，其中包括有关父母收入的问题" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Alex Cochran.资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure> E <span class="smallcaps">arlier</span> <span class="smallcaps">this month</span> , the century-old Pac-12 athletic conference was swiftly and brutally eviscerated. In the space of a few hours, five member universities left for rival conferences offering massive paydays financed by TV-sports contracts. As Jemele Hill <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/college-football-greed-conference-alignment/674930/">put it</a> for <i>The Atlantic</i> , the shift “pits the long-term interests of schools and conferences against their own insatiable greed.”<br><br> Sports lovers are used to watching their favorite teams put money ahead of the wishes of their fans. That makes it easy to forget that this isn&#39;t a story about professional-sports franchises—or, indeed, private entities of any kind. All five of the defecting schools are public universities: Washington, Oregon, Utah, Arizona, and Arizona State. The money grab in college football is just one symptom of a troubling strain in American public higher education. Many of our public universities, it turns out, don&#39;t act very much like public institutions at all.<br><br> It&#39;s natural to assume that public institutions of higher education would be more egalitarian than their private counterparts. In K–12, public school is free, while private school is expensive. But at the college level, the line between civic purpose and private profit doesn&#39;t map so neatly onto the public/private divide. The clearest evidence to date comes from a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">blockbuster study</a> by a trio of economists at Harvard&#39;s Opportunity Insights project. Most media coverage has focused on the study&#39;s analysis of the so-called Ivy Plus schools, where the researchers found that the wealthiest students get an admissions bump relative to other applicants with the same academic profile. Even among people with identical SAT scores, students from the top 0.1 percent of income are more than twice as likely to get into universities like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Public flagships such as UC Berkeley and the University of Virginia showed no such bias.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/public-universities-debt/619546/">Josh Mitchell: A crimson tide of debt</a><br><br> But the researchers didn&#39;t just study the tiny clique of elite universities that dominates the public discourse. Their sample included 139 institutions, including 50 public universities, and the results show a more complicated picture. Not all private schools are biased in favor of the rich—and some of the schools that cater most egregiously to the wealthy turn out to be public.<br><br> Like many aspects of life in our large, divided nation, the character of your local university depends a lot on where you happen to live. Big blue states such as New York and California have extensive, highly regarded university systems with no wealth bias in admissions. If anything, they have the opposite. The ultra-wealthy are almost 50 percent <i>less</i> likely to attend Berkeley than similarly qualified not-rich students. The trend applies throughout the University of California system, as well as campuses in the State University of New York. Although public-university budgets nationwide were devastated by the Great Recession, California and New York eventually <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://shef.sheeo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SHEEO_SHEF_FY22_Report.pdf">restored</a> the lost funding and invested even more. That gives them the resources to keep tuition low and creates fewer incentives to chase wealthy applicants. The sheer size of those systems also means that power and money aren&#39;t concentrated in a single flagship university with aspirations of athletic greatness. SUNY at Stony Brook and UC Santa Barbara are both top-flight research universities, but nobody is paying big money for the broadcast rights to Stony Brook Seawolves or UCSB Gauchos football games; the latter team doesn&#39;t even exist. There&#39;s no deep-seated culture of rich athletic boosters, legacy admissions, and regional aristocracy surrounding these campuses.<br><br> The story is different in other states, especially in the South. Statistically, public universities such as Auburn University, the University of Mississippi, the University of Arkansas, and the University of Alabama look a lot like the Ivy Pluses in their approach to wealth and admissions. These schools are not highly selective—most people who apply are admitted—so the mechanism for exclusion works differently than at Princeton or Yale. To measure it, the Opportunity Insights researchers looked not just at admit rates but at whether applicants were likely to apply and attend, an approach that captures the whole process of marketing, recruitment, admissions, pricing, and enrollment. Their findings suggest that a college need not be ultra-elite to perpetuate class divides. Some public universities in the South serve the same function as private colleges and universities in the Northeast: destinations for the children of political leaders and wealthy businessmen, and a mechanism for transmitting that status to the next generation. Although Alabama has one of the highest poverty rates in America, only 11 percent of Auburn students qualify for a federal Pell grant. More than <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/healthstats/assets/83t2019.pdf">30 percent</a> of college-age Alabama residents are Black, yet Black students make up <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://auburn.edu/administration/ir/factbook/enrollment-demographics/historical-summaries/enrollment-gender-ethnicity.html">less than 5 percent</a> of Auburn&#39;s student body.<br><br> So if you&#39;re wondering how public-university students in the South can afford <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sorority-consultants-rush-colleges-parents-prepare-80b2cfc8">$4,000 sorority-rush consultants</a> , as <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> recently reported, it&#39;s because their parents have money. If you&#39;re curious about why so many rich kids are on campus, it&#39;s because places like the University of Alabama give an effective 45 percent bump to the children of the top 1 percent. And if you want to know why few very low-income Black students attend these universities, it&#39;s because the schools were originally built to sustain a racist power structure that kept Black people in poverty, and those legacies have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/opinion/auburn-university-black-students.html">not yet</a> been overcome.<br><br> Representatives from the universities of Arkansas and Alabama both told me that they work hard to recruit and provide financial aid to low-income students in their respective states, which is true. Both say that income is not one of the official criteria that their admissions officers consider. But it doesn&#39;t have to be, because a very efficient unofficial filter is at play. Most of the students attending schools like the universities of Arkansas and Alabama come from other places, meaning they pay out-of-state tuition. At Alabama, where 58 percent of undergrads come from elsewhere, that amounts to $32,400 a year, plus room and board. Students who can afford such a high sticker price are wealthy almost by definition, and they are vital to public-university finances. The University of Michigan <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://admissions.umich.edu/costs-aid/costs">charges</a> out-of-state students more than $55,000, the same price as Harvard. Administrators are essentially running two institutions in parallel: a reasonably affordable public university for the residents of Michigan (in-state tuition: $16,736), and a very expensive private university for everyone else.<br><br> This dual identity shows up in the Harvard-study results. The richest and poorest students from Michigan get into Michigan at similar rates, controlling for test scores. For out-of-state students, however, there&#39;s a marked lean toward the rich. Again, this works differently than it does at elite private universities. In the Ivy Plus schools, the pro-wealth bias is accomplished with a witches&#39; brew of legacy preferences, admissions bumps for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/college-sports-benefits-white-students/573688/">patrician sports</a> such as squash and sailing, and outright <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-story-behind-jared-kushners-curious-acceptance-into-harvard">pay-to-play arrangements</a> for mega-donors. At public universities, it&#39;s a more straightforward downstream effect of pricing. Most out-of-state students get little or no financial aid, so only the rich can afford to enroll.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Universities defend these policies</span> by arguing that wealthy students subsidize their poorer classmates, who don&#39;t pay full price. But as the sociologists Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton describe in their groundbreaking 2015 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/paying-for-the-party-how-college-maintains-inequality-elizabeth-a-armstrong/9780674088023?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Paying for the Party</i></a> <i>,</i> the two-tier approach works out badly for first-generation and low-income students. Following two groups of undergraduates at Indiana University, they found that the wealthy out-of-staters sailed through four years of fraternity parties and weekend tailgates to graduate, marry, and start careers, while the first-gen students ended up with burdensome student loans, uncertain job prospects, and no degrees.<br><br> For some low-income students, the dream of attending a flagship public university turns sour. At Alabama, there&#39;s an 18-percentage-point <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=university+of+alabama&amp;s=all&amp;id=100751#outcome">gap</a> between the graduation rate of Pell-grant students and their more well-off peers, an unusually large disparity. Despite all of those out-of-state dollars, families earning less than $75,000 still pay <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=university+of+alabama&amp;s=all&amp;id=100751#expenses">about</a> $20,000 a year in total costs to attend. Auburn&#39;s numbers are similarly grim. The more public universities come to resemble private ones, the more they cater to the people who pay the bills. Consider the three mega-conferences that now dominate the college-football landscape, the SEC, Big 10, and Big 12. Michigan State, University of Florida, Purdue, University of Kentucky, Texas A&amp;M: all big-time sports schools, all running the out-of-state full-tuition racket, all skewed toward the rich.<br><br> The gap between public universities that combat wealth inequality and those that seem to perpetuate it maps onto the red/blue divide, but only roughly. Higher education in America is also shaped by idiosyncrasies of history and geography. North Carolina, a purplish state, has a great, well-funded system of affordable public universities. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has no wealth preferences, nor does North Carolina State. (Duke University, right nearby, has that covered.) Pennsylvania, a fairly blue state, has an unusually lousy tradition of inadequate funding for public universities. Penn State charges non-Pennsylvanians $38,000 a year.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Annie Lowrey: Why you have to care about these 12 colleges</a><br><br> One kind of university seems immune to all of these trends: science-and-engineering schools. Based on my analysis of the data, only five private universities in the Harvard study were <i>less</i> likely to admit applicants from the top 0.1 percent than comparably qualified middle-class students. Four of them—California Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Worcester Polytechnic University, and Case Western Reserve University—have top-class engineering programs. Among the Ivy Pluses, MIT was the least corrupted by wealth preferences. Public universities such as the Georgia Institute of Technology, Virginia Tech, and the Colorado School of Mines also had more egalitarian results.<br><br> Even the most elite liberal-arts school can create an easy glide path to graduation for the dull-witted progeny of a deep-pocketed alum. Athletic recruits can famously go from start to finish at a big state school without encountering a single challenging idea along the way. Engineering schools, by contrast, have academic standards that are harder to evade. Martin Schmidt, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic, came to the job after serving as provost at MIT. “There&#39;s a phrase we used there,” he told me, about the rigorous math and science classes all students are required to take. “&#39;There&#39;s nowhere to hide.&#39;”<br><br> Of course, not every university can or should be devoted to math and science. But the existence of these respected engineering institutions—public and private, humble and world-renowned—shows that there&#39;s nothing inevitable about higher-education systems that bend toward the gravity of wealth. If academic standards come first, the power of money recedes. Otherwise, colleges and universities become just one more thing to be bought and sold.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/public-university-wealthy-admissions/675009/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/public-university-wealthy-admissions/675009/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Right Price, Wrong Politics]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> People want to live in states with access to abortion care.

Gun safety. The treatment of immigrants. The size of the safety net. Ease of voting. LGBTQ rights. On any number of policy issues, red states and blue states have drifted <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/chicago-scholarship-online/book/46284">apart</a> from each other over the past three decades, widening the gaps between what families in different parts of the country pay in taxes, receive in benefits, and experience when interacting with the government. At the same time, the cost of housing in these states has diverged, too. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-jenny-schuetz.html">Blue states</a> have throttled their housing supply, leading to dramatic price increases and spurring millions of families to relocate to red states in the Sun Belt.<br><br> These trends have intensified in the past few years, as conservative legislatures have passed a raft of laws restricting abortion access and targeting LGBTQ Americans and as housing shortages have spread. Now many Americans find themselves stuck in states that are enacting conservative policies they <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/abortion-gop-electoral-problem-ohio/674999/">do not support</a> , but where real estate is cheap.<br><br> That is one takeaway from a new <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-survey-florida-texas-legal-abortion/">Redfin survey</a> of people who rent their home, are thinking about moving, or have recently moved. Respondents were much more likely to say that they wanted to live in a state where abortion and gender-affirming care were legal than not. But compared with those issues, they were twice as likely to cite housing costs as a major determinant of where they would live.<br><br> The report focused on two red states, Texas and Florida. They are among the 20 states that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lwv.org/blog/abortion-rights-and-access-one-year-after-dobbs">have restricted</a> access to the medical termination of a pregnancy or banned abortion outright since the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em> last year. And they are among the two <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/transgender-laws-states.html">dozen states</a> that have implemented statutes affecting trans people: banning gender-affirming care, requiring trans youth to be identified by the gender they were assigned at birth, restricting trans kids&#39; participation in sports, or barring teachers from discussing what it means to be gay or trans.<br><br> Yet such states remain a draw for families from blue, coastal areas. “There&#39;s this trade-off between living somewhere that you can afford and where you have access to jobs,” Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin, told me, versus living “where the laws are the way that you want them to be.”<br><br> In the survey, not everyone professed a policy preference, but roughly a third of Texans and Floridians who had recently moved or were likely to move said that they would like to live somewhere with legal gender-affirming care for kids. That is eight to 16 percentage points higher than the share who said they do <em>not</em> want to live somewhere where such gender-affirming care is legal. About 40 percent of respondents in those states said they would like to live somewhere with legal abortion access, twice as many as said they would prefer to live somewhere without it.<br><br> But folks were still much more likely to say that financial considerations played a primary role in where they had settled or would settle down. The cost of living, access to jobs, the size of available homes, and proximity to family were more commonly cited factors.<br><br> Over the past two decades, the country&#39;s growing housing shortage has prevented Americans from moving <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/harvard_jchs_are_americans_stuck_in_place_frost_2020.pdf">as often as they used to</a> , and as often as would make sense given the country&#39;s wage trends. Jobs pay much more in Boston and Oakland than they do in small towns in Alabama or exurbs in Utah, a differential that has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2023/06/geographic-inequality-rise-us">grown over time</a> . But housing costs in those places rose so much <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12355/w12355.pdf">because of supply restrictions</a> that they became unaffordable and inaccessible for many would-be residents.<br><br> People who are moving tend to be moving to cheaper places. Differences in housing affordability have pulled Americans to the Sun Belt and the Mountain West, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.freddiemac.com/research/insight/20220622-pursuit-affordable-housing-migration-homebuyers-within">pushed</a> them from expensive megalopolises to smaller cities, suburbs, and exurbs. Redfin&#39;s data, for instance, show that the average home in Miami is selling for $515,000 versus $705,000 in New York, the most common origin of out-of-state movers. Homes in Dallas are half the price of homes in Los Angeles.<br><br> “Even if people would want, in a perfect world, to move to a different place that didn&#39;t have whatever-it-might-be laws, they&#39;re kept in place by these bigger, more salient forces for them,” Riordan Frost, a senior research analyst at Harvard&#39;s Joint Center for Housing Studies, told me. (Frost did not work on the Redfin project.) “Even though there are abortion restrictions, people move because of affordability. Even though there are wildfires and more <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.freddiemac.com/research/insight/20221109-migration-environmentally-risky-areas-consequence">natural disasters in a place</a> , people move because of affordability.”<br><br> Those migration trends have increased red states&#39; political influence. Texas and Florida alone have added more than 15 million <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/03/texas-population-passes-the-30-million-mark-in-2022.html#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202022%2C%20the%20state%20gained%209%2C085%2C073%20residents%2C%20more,Nevada%2C%20Utah%2C%20and%20Idaho.">residents</a> over <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/03/texas-population-passes-the-30-million-mark-in-2022.html#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202022%2C%20the%20state%20gained%209%2C085%2C073%20residents%2C%20more,Nevada%2C%20Utah%2C%20and%20Idaho.">the past two decades</a> , translating into a dozen additional congressional seats. Blue states, in contrast, have throttled their population growth. “It&#39;s a policy choice on both fronts: California has chosen to protect abortion rights, and they&#39;ve chosen to have policies that restrict housing,” Fairweather told me. “I don&#39;t even know if policy makers understand this yet. But California&#39;s housing policies have made the citizens of the United States have less access to those rights.”<br><br> In interviews, people personally affected by anti-LGBTQ laws described them as a strong motivator to leave the red states they call home. Jay Bates Domenech, a young trans person from suburban Utah, told me that the state&#39;s political climate had pushed them to spend roughly $10,000 more a semester to go to an out-of-state college: Domenech is moving to Colorado this week.<br><br> Domenech told me that they had been harassed and bullied for their gender in high school. “A few months ago, a kid followed me down the hallway calling me a pedophile. He took out his phone to take a picture of me,” they told me. “From the moment I came out, there was an underlying anxiety that something was going to happen to me.” Concerns about their physical safety and ability to access health care pushed them to move, they said, adding that they felt targeted by the state&#39;s anti-LGBTQ politicians. “The increase in suicide rates and mental-health diagnoses—it&#39;s something I am seeing at a personal, individual level,” they told me.<br><br> But many other queer and trans people don&#39;t have the money or flexibility to uproot their lives. Anthony, who asked me to withhold his last name to avoid any threats to his family, moved from Maryland to Florida five years ago, purchasing a fixer-upper for $220,000. “I&#39;m scared about what the Florida legislature is going to do,” he told me. He and his husband would like to move back to the DC area. But high interest rates and the higher cost of living would make it unaffordable to do so.<br><br> Redfin&#39;s finding that people would prefer to live in places with legal access to abortion mirrors that of many <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-poll-roe-dobbs-ban-opinion-fcfdfc5a799ac3be617d99999e92eabe">other polls</a> . States barring or tightening access to abortion have seen an 11 or 12 percentage-point increase in the share of people who say the medical procedure should be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/04/26/nearly-a-year-after-roes-demise-americans-views-of-abortion-access-increasingly-vary-by-where-they-live/">easier to obtain</a> .<br><br> In the long term, the loss of abortion access is expected to intensify the country&#39;s already intense geographic inequality. The hundreds of thousands of people forced to continue unwanted pregnancies will end up sicker and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/abortion-turnaway-study-roe-supreme-court/661246/">poorer for it</a> : Not being able to terminate a pregnancy makes a person more likely to become impoverished, unemployed, in debt, and subject to eviction, and an abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. Many companies are avoiding adding employees or doing business in states with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/08/companies-paying-for-abortion-travel-expenses/671174/">strict bans</a> .<br><br> Yet the Redfin data suggest that relatively few people will move because of changing health-care statutes. Abortion access is already heavily predicated on a person&#39;s physical location and socioeconomic status: Wealthy Texans fly to Illinois for abortions; poor Tennessee residents find themselves stuck. “There are states that were destinations for people seeking abortions where clinics have closed post-Dobbs, forming abortion deserts, particularly in the southeastern and central United States,” Betsy Pleasants, a researcher at UC Berkeley&#39;s Wallace Center for Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, told me. Those deserts are simply too formidable and expensive for many people to cross.<br><br> Sam Dickman is one person who did leave Texas as a result of the state&#39;s changing legal abortion landscape. He is a physician and an abortion provider. He and his partner moved to Montana so that he could continue to do his life&#39;s work.<br><br> “I see patients traveling in from Texas, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota, all these states surrounding Montana, to get abortion care,” he told me. “The median abortion patient is a young, low-income person of color. These are populations who are struggling to afford rent.” He added: “If I asked a patient, <em>Have you ever thought about moving to a place with better abortion access?</em> It would be item No. 15 on their radar. They would look at me like, <em>What are you talking about? I can&#39;t afford to have a kid right now. Obviously, I can&#39;t afford to move.</em> ”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/housing-survey-abortion-access-gender-affirming-care-state-policies/675017/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/housing-survey-abortion-access-gender-affirming-care-state-policies/675017/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Georgia Indictment Offers the Whole Picture]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>法尼·威利斯 (Fani Willis) 对唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 和其他 18 人提出指控，指控其实施了一项旨在推翻 2020 年大选的全面计划。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ylCMLnbSHgvlha1yQZ43s_A_hbA=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/trump_georgia/original.jpg" alt="刘易斯·P·斯莱顿法院" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>伊利亚·努维拉奇/法新社/盖蒂</figcaption></figure><small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">, Monday through Friday.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small><br><br>如果正义是盲目的，她有时会走上不可预测的道路。例如，只有在昨晚于亚特兰大公布的唐纳德·特朗普的第四份重罪起诉书中，当地检察官才成功地在全国范围内对这位前总统窃取 2020 年大选的计划提出了全面的看法。<br><br>富尔顿县地方检察官法尼·威利斯 (Fani Willis) 获得的起诉书指控特朗普和其他 18 人实施跨州、持续数月的敲诈勒索计划，旨在颠覆特朗普落败的选举结果。 Some of the names are household ones, or have become so over the past three years: Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Mark Meadows.

(What&#39;s to stop conservative prosecutors in small counties from bringing flimsy charges against Joe Biden?)<br><br> Willis has the freedom to bring a much broader case in part <em>because</em> she is a local prosecutor.尽管在梅里克·加兰 (Merrick Garland) 的领导下，司法部强调了与政治的距离，但史密斯必须知道，联邦 RICO 的巨大支持在政治上是多么具有煽动性，而且可能是行不通的。 Perhaps even more important, he knows that if Trump or another Republican wins the 2024 election, they will likely try to shut down any federal prosecution as soon as they take office—encouraging him to keep his case tightly focused and fast-moving.威利斯是一名民选官员，没有同样的政治限制，她的案件也不受联邦行政部门突发奇想的影响。<br><br> <a

案件是出了名的复杂、笨拙，有时甚至会让陪审员感到困惑，即使是在政治色彩较少的情况下也是如此。 In a statement last night, Trump argued that his actions as charged under the indictment constitute free speech.他说：“他们正在剥夺特朗普总统的第一修正案言论自由权，以及挑战民主党一直在做的被操纵和被盗的选举的权利。”<br><br>特朗普还抱怨称，提出指控的时间太长。在没有任何证据的情况下，他写道，威利斯“战略性地阻止了她的调查，试图最大限度地干扰 2024 年总统竞选”，并补充道，“他们本可以在两年半前提出这一点。”尽管调查需要时间，但他说得有道理。尽管如此，强调所有美国人在其颠覆计划发生时都知道这一点并不像特朗普可能想假装的那样是无罪的。<br><br>不管时间安排的原因是什么，威利斯现在脑子里想的是速度。 She said at a press conference after the indictments were released that she wanted to bring all 19 defendants to trial together within the next six months.这将使此案处于共和党初选的白热化阶段。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-11-10/sam-bankman-fried-sbf-was-seen-by-vcs-as-a-model-founder-at-ftx">与投资者对成功科技创始人的看法相匹配，</a>这并没有损害他的声誉。<br><br>班克曼-弗里德在软禁期间的表现，对于一个正处于严重法律斗争中的人来说，表现出令人惊讶的自信。负责班克曼-弗里德案的曼哈顿联邦地区法院法官刘易斯·卡普兰周五表示，被告“一次又一次地走上警线”。自从开始软禁以来，班克曼-弗里德邀请了一位加密货币影响者过来，与作家迈克尔刘易斯讨论一本书，并使用 VPN 登录互联网。他在家里的行为并没有令检方满意，今年早些时候，在他被指控试图联系另一名前 FTX 高管和该案的可能证人后，检方已经收紧了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-seeks-tougher-bail-restrictions-for-sam-bankman-fried-f4602e45">他的保释条款</a>。然后，他的非正统行为似乎更进一步： <i>《纽约时报》</i>上个月发表了一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html">文章</a>，其中包括班克曼-弗里德加密对冲基金前任负责人卡罗琳·埃里森以及他的前女友的泄露日记。尽管文章没有说明这些条目的来源，但控方律师后来表示，班克曼-弗里德是消息来源。班克曼-弗里德的律师在一份<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.178.0.pdf">法庭文件</a>中证实，他分享了“某些文件”，但反驳说，他在就此事与《纽约时报》沟通时“没有做错任何事”。 （在加入<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>之前，我是报道 FTX 崩溃的<i>《纽约时报》</i>记者团队的一员，但我没有参与最近的这篇文章。）<br><br>在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.176.0.pdf">法庭文件</a>中，检察官辩称，泄露日记是为了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/technology/sam-bankman-fried-jail.html">恐吓和败坏埃里森的</a>名声，让人们认为“埃里森是一个被抛弃的情人，独自犯下了这些罪行”。埃里森去年 12 月对联邦指控<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/ftxs-gary-wang-alamedas-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-federal-charges-cooperating-with-prosecutors.html">认罪</a>，预计将成为今年秋季班克曼-弗里德刑事审判的关键证人。法官发布临时禁言令后， <i>《纽约时报》</i>和其他组织的律师以第一修正案为由反对该命令。截至周五，禁言令的状态尚不清楚。<br><br>得知班克曼-弗里德据称泄露日记是为了抹黑埃里森，我们感到很惊讶，因为这些日记让埃里森听起来相当同情。在该基金崩溃前的几个月，埃里森对她作为领导者的能力表示怀疑，而且，是的，她对与班克曼·弗里德的分手感到受伤。她在 11 月发给 Bankman-Fried 的消息中表示，她对 FTX 即将崩溃感到恐惧，但她似乎并没有根据这种感觉采取行动。令我震惊的是，埃里森的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-file-schedules-and-statements-of-financial-affairs-with-bankruptcy-court-301773613.html?tc=eml_cleartime">薪酬</a>远低于她的男同事。<br><br>此案是一个复杂的商业和法律困境，但也可能涉及很多人际关系的混乱。 FTX 的几位领导人（包括 Ellison 和 Bankman-Fried）一起住在巴哈马的一套顶层公寓里。同事们曾经是朋友，现在可能会与政府合作对抗彼此。<br><br>在垮台之前，班克曼-弗里德在狂野西部行业中树立了负责任的加密货币领导者的形象。现在，他加入了雄心勃勃的科技创始人的行列，包括那些受到媒体阿谀奉承和巨额资金资助的创始人，他们被指控欺骗投资者和共谋洗钱。多年来，科技行业<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/15/business/silicon-valley-fraud.html">奖励</a>冒险、“颠覆”和“打破事物”。但最近发生的一系列丑闻让公众——尤其是投资者——对这些原则更加怀疑。在 2010 年代，当<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/1d2af214-caf6-4326-916d-b597577186c8">资金很便宜</a>时，被魅力型领导者吸引的风险投资家不会向他们所参与的公司提出很多问题。但更高的利率导致了硅谷的裁员、相互指责和一段相对紧缩的时期。现在不再是一切都顺利的情况了。启动资金大幅下降，投资者正在更加密切地关注公司的声明。科技巨头正在联邦法院接受调查并被指控行为不当：Theranos 创始人伊丽莎白·霍尔姆斯 (Elizabeth Holmes) 几个月前被判犯有欺诈投资者罪，并被<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/business/elizabeth-holmes-jail-restitution.html">勒令入狱</a>；查理·贾维斯 (Charlie

href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-22/frank-founder-javice-pleads-not-guilty-to-defrauding-jpmorgan">表示无罪</a>。）<br><br>即使在这群科技创始人中，班克曼-弗里德也是一个令人惊讶的难以预测的人物。我将从这里观察他的表现，以及卡普兰的回应。<br><br><b>有关的：</b><br><br><li>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>伊芙琳霍克斯坦/路透社</figcaption></figure>在爱荷华州博览会上，我附近的人们都很疯狂。 “你看到他了吗？”他们气喘吁吁。 “你认为他会到人群中讲话吗？”当特勤局官员明确表示前总统唐纳德·特朗普将出现在大广场的 Steer &#39;N Stein 餐厅时，展会上的人们排起了长队，队伍的尽头在视线之外。<br><br>并不是所有的人都能挤进餐厅，所以他们挤满了外面的街道，一大群热切、满头大汗的爱荷华人。当这位前总统终于出现时，人群拥挤不堪，从餐厅的空旷一侧几乎看不清他的轮廓。 “你知道，其他候选人也来到了这里，他们大约有六个人，”特朗普令人眼花缭乱的声音通过我们上方的扬声器说道。观众报以热烈的掌声和欢呼声。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/trump-indictment-unsealed-2024-presidential-campaign/674359/">大卫·阿克塞尔罗德：起诉书令人震惊。特朗普的支持者会关心吗？</a><br><br>美国政治中为数不多的能够经受住过去动荡岁月的怪异的规则之一是，任何想成为美国总统的人都必须忍受爱荷华州博览会的众多辉煌和同样多的仪式性羞辱。这是一次重要的试镜，至少对共和党来说是这样。 （民主党最近重新调整了初选顺序，将爱荷华州党团会议的全国第一地位降级。）<br><br>如果一位浑身是汗、塞满了炸黄油的共和党候选人能够激起爱荷华州挑剔选民的兴趣，那么这位候选人就在预选会议上有真正的机会，也许还有入主白宫的机会。有时，一个前景渺茫的局外人可以吸引人群并获得意想不到的优势，就像里克·桑托勒姆 (Rick Santorum) 在 2012 年和泰德·克鲁兹 (Ted Cruz) 在 2016 年所做的那样。<br><br>因此，博览会是一个让人着迷和被迷住的地方。周末早些时候，它似乎发挥了魔力。<br><br> “他真的非常有魅力，”来自得梅因的雪莉·伯吉斯这样评价迈克·彭斯。 “我认为他亲自传达的信息比我在电视上从他那里得到的信息要清晰得多。”这位前副总统刚刚<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kcci.com/article/mike-pence-joins-governor-kim-reynolds-for-iowa-state-fair-side-chat/44794244">结束了</a>共和党州长金雷诺兹主持的几场“公平谈判”之一。这是博览会上的一个新特色，州长会向候选人提出一些尖锐的问题，例如“你最喜欢的罢工歌曲是什么？”<br><br>前一天晚上，彭斯被一名男子质问，“在塔克·卡尔森毁了你的职业生涯之后”，他过得怎么样。另一个人说：“我很高兴他们没有绞死你！”<br><br>但周五早上，彭斯在 JR 的南猪牧场与雷诺兹的谈话吸引了一群尊敬的人群。与会者向他提出了礼貌的问题，六人亲自感谢他在特朗普试图推翻 2020 年大选结果时的“正直”。<br><br>不过，彭斯也有同伴。佛罗里达州州长 Ron DeSantis、前联合国大使 Nikki Haley 和企业家 Vivek Ramaswamy 也在猪肉牧场和<i>得梅因纪事报</i>的 Soapbox 场地吸引了人群。大多数出席的尚未做出决定的爱荷华州人告诉我，他们在 2016 年和 2020 年都支持特朗普。他们说，这些选民赞赏他的服务，但经过八年在社交媒体上的愚蠢咆哮、毫无根据但无情的选举舞弊断言和面对一连串的刑事起诉，他们渴望一些新的活力。他们告诉我，你知道，一个没有那么多包袱的领导者；有人更……优雅。<br><br> “从他嘴里说出来的一切就像是，‘闭嘴，唐纳德’”来自爱荷华州约翰斯顿的两次特朗普选民查尔斯·邓拉普 (Charles Dunlap) 告诉我。他渴望听到拉马斯瓦米和黑利的意见，他相信他们会“制定与特朗普类似的政策”——只是没有戏剧性。<br><br>但周六下午 1 点左右，当这位前总统抵达时，博览会的亲密魅力——深思熟虑、慎重考虑的承诺——消失了。很快我就清楚了，那天早上我遇到的那些对特朗普精疲力尽、思想发生改变的爱荷华州人只是少数。大多数人？他们仍然爱特朗普。<br><br>这位前总统跳过了肥皂盒和雷诺兹的可能演讲时段（因为他与州长的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-feuds-iowa-gov-kim-reynolds-rcna93470">奇怪冲突</a>），但出现与他的人民打成一片。他们挤进了总统可能发表讲话的每一个公平场所。由于他的活动没有任何官方时间表，所以每个人都在猜测。游乐场的部分区域陷入瘫痪。那些只想喝柠檬水、欣赏获奖小公牛的人们感到很恼火。 “为什么我们一定要在所有政客都来的那天来？”一个推着婴儿车穿过人群的男人问他的妻子。 （根据记录，几乎每个爱荷华州人都曾经说过这句话。）<br><br>鉴于他在共和党初选民意调查中遥遥领先，特朗普的出现会引发如此热烈的情绪也就不足为奇了。但看到它，感受到它，却是不同的。相比之下，聚集在一起支持其他共和党候选人的人群似乎一点也不令人印象深刻。突然之间，整个共和党初选都让人感到痛苦的徒劳，甚至可悲。<i>他们为什么要这样做？</i>对于落选者来说——基本上是竞选中的其他人——在竞选过程中遭受的虐待是否值得被任命为特朗普的竞选搭档，即使是最好的情况？<br><br>周六，当彭斯站在阳光下翻转猪肉汉堡时，人群中的人们窃窃私语着他。 “看看他的汗水，”我身后有人说。 “他是个笨蛋，德桑蒂斯也是，”来自锡达拉皮兹的一位名叫雅各布（拒绝透露姓氏）的年轻人告诉我。 “你只是想拿走他们的午餐钱。这是本能。”拉马斯瓦米的个性吸引了许多共和党人，他在接受州长采访后显然觉得有必要表现<i>得不那么呆板</i>，并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5081268/vivek-ramaswamy-raps-eminems-lose-yourself">自信地</a>唱着埃米纳姆的歌曲“Lose Yourself”。一大群银发围观者发现自己被困在舞台前面，不得不笨拙地向前移动。<br><br>德桑蒂斯在展会上遭受的损失比其他任何人都大。 While he spoke with Reynolds, a plane flew in circles overhead, carrying a long sign that read <span class="smallcaps">Be likable, Ron!</span>德桑蒂斯假装没有注意到。当佛罗里达州州长在猪肉帐篷里轮到他时，特朗普的支持者聚集在他的拍照区后面，戴着特朗普竞选团队分发的绿黄相间的卡车司机帽。当德桑蒂斯和他的妻子翻转汉堡时，他们高喊口号并大声辱骂。<br><br>当特朗普最终于周六下午抵达时，他带来了一群在德桑蒂斯问题上支持他的佛罗里达州议员。 （众议员马特·盖兹（Matt Gaetz）表示，他在猪肉帐篷里烤的汉堡做得很好，但“你能做到的最好的是罗恩·德桑蒂斯”，这让人群热情高涨。）这种羞辱最终会得到回报吗？德桑蒂斯的竞选团队必须希望如此。 At least in Iowa, the Florida governor is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/us/politics/trump-iowa-poll.html">running somewhat closer to Trump</a> than he is nationally.<br><br>当天早些时候，我采访了马特·威尔斯（Matt Wells），他是德桑蒂斯的支持者，也是来自爱荷华州华盛顿的县主席，他整个上午都在集市上跟踪这位候选人。特朗普的人民“并不真正知道自己在做什么；他们不知道自己在做什么”。 “这都是情感上的事情，”他告诉我。威尔斯曾在 2016 年为特德·克鲁兹的竞选团队工作过。他说，当时他们的地面比赛表现出色，就像德桑蒂斯现在所做的那样。 “特朗普，”威尔斯补充道，“这里没有任何地面游戏。”<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ron-desantis-cnn-interview/674751/">海伦·刘易斯：罗恩·德桑蒂斯的羞辱</a><br><br>克鲁兹可能赢得了爱荷华州，但令人难忘的是他最终没有赢得 2016 年大选。当我正要说出这个事实时，我们附近的一个人倒吸了一口气。十几根手指指向天空，人们开始兴奋地尖叫。在我们头顶的亮蓝色海洋中，有一架侧面印有<span class="smallcaps">特朗普</span>字样的飞机正飞往附近的机场。 Someone whispered, “Did I tell you that I shook his hand twice?”喧闹声越来越大。<br><br>特朗普很快就会来这里。这个人，那个神话，已经登陆了。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 16:03:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">
