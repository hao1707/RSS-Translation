href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/06/the-flash-production-issues-muschietti/674334/"><em>《闪电侠》</em></a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/06/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-review/674509/"><em>《夺宝奇兵》</em></a>等几部大片表现不佳， <a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/disney-box-office-failures-indiana-jones-elemental-ant-man-1235660409/">很快就陷入了</a>绝望。但上周末带来了巨大的转变，这要归功于<em>《巴本海默》</em> ——格蕾塔·葛韦格饰演的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/"><em>芭比娃娃</em></a>和克里斯托弗·诺兰饰演的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/"><em>奥本海默</em></a>的正面交锋。这两部电影是完全不同的、由导演主导的作品，它们使各自的预期票房翻了一番，并共同推动了历史上第四高的首周末票房。夏天可以拯救了！然而，随着演员和编剧的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywoods-cruel-strategy/674730/">罢工</a>持续不断，制片厂似乎几乎一心要粉碎任何真正的行业发展势头的机会。<br><br>让<em>芭比</em>与<em>奥本海默</em>对抗的策略最初似乎很冒险。但葛韦格的亮粉色名牌喜剧与诺兰的 R 级三小时传记史诗之间的差异也引发了炒作。最终， <em>《芭比娃娃》</em>的首映票房为 1.62 亿美元， <em>《奥本海默》</em>的首映票房为 8200 万美元——前者创下了女性导演电影的票房纪录，而诺兰则获得了非蝙蝠侠电影史上最高的周末票房收入。<br><br>在经历了几个月商业上平淡无奇的续集之后，这对电影业来说是一个巨大的、令人振奋的成功。最重要的是，这清楚地表明观众渴望优质产品。大片并没有过时，但电影公司不能仅仅依赖最新的系列作品；一些老牌公司（例如 DC 漫画和<em>速度与激情</em>）开始失去光彩。<em>芭比</em>和<em>奥本海默</em>通过获得积极评价和提供真正引人注目的东西赢得了观众的热情：<em>芭比</em>在人群中非常有趣和快乐；<em>奥本海默的</em>视觉效果令人惊叹，并在 IMAX 等大型优质银幕上提升了其销量。这两部电影都获得了 A 级 CinemaScore，这是口碑的良好指标，因此整个 8 月份的票房应该会保持健康。<br><br>尽管如此，麻烦即将来临，第一个例子也出现在上周末。由<em>赞</em>达亚主演的浪漫网球喜剧《挑战者》 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/zendaya-challengers-actors-strike-release-date-1235444723/">将上映日期</a>从 9 月 15 日改为明年 4 月 26 日，取消了原定在威尼斯电影节上映的计划。这部电影由卢卡·瓜达格尼诺（《<em>请以你的名字呼唤我</em>》）执导，本来打算在米高梅的影院大肆宣传，但演员工会罢工意味着赞达亚和她的联合主演可能无法宣传这部电影，这会给依赖明星力量的项目带来困难。<br><br>其他几个项目也因为罢工而被推迟，包括 A24 的独立喜剧<em>《Problemista》</em> 、狮门影业的励志剧<em>《白鸟》</em>和<em>《辣身舞》</em>续集。但接下来真正的多米诺骨牌可能会倒下，有<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/dune-2-release-date-change-2024-warner-bros-strike-1235676007/">传言</a>称华纳兄弟可能会将其即将上映的大片<em>——《沙丘第二部》</em> 、 <em>《紫色》</em>和<em>《海王与失落的王国</em>》——从 2023 年的日历中剔除。计划于秋季上映的其他大片包括马丁·斯科塞斯的<em>《花月杀手》</em> 、超级英雄电影<em>《奇迹》</em>和《<em>饥饿游戏》</em>前传，所有这些都需要明星在新闻发布会上来推动其销售。 （<em>芭比</em>和<em>奥本海默</em>的演员们在罢工之前接受了许多媒体采访。）<br><br>危机不仅正在酝酿，而且还在酝酿之中。它在这里。电影制片厂不与美国演员工会和美国作家协会恢复谈判的每一天都会危及好莱坞的未来。新冠疫情造成的连年延误加剧了人们对电影的生存焦虑：更多的电影被分发到流媒体服务，观众也习惯了在家观看新上映的电影。现在人们又可以放心地去看电影了，<em>巴本海默</em>现象正在提醒各个年龄段的观众，大银幕体验的价值。不利用这种能量将是一个灾难性的错误。<br><br>然而，这似乎是电影和电视制片人联盟（代表主要制片厂的松散贸易协会）愿意犯的错误。 WGA 已经罢工 84 天，没有迹象表明短期内会恢复谈判。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/writers-strike-hollywood-studios-deal-fight-wga-actors-1235434335/"><em>Deadline 的</em>一篇文章</a>援引一位匿名“顶级制片人”的话说，制片厂将允许僵局至少持续到十月。 AMPTP 予以反击，声称其“致力于达成协议”。不管怎样，这篇报道强调了 WGA 和制片厂之间的关系已经变得多么有害。残差、生成人工智能的使用以及流数据的共享都是重要的分歧点。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywoods-cruel-strategy/674730/">阅读：商人打破了好莱坞</a><br><br>多年来，娱乐业经历了多次 WGA 罢工，但 SAG 的行动更令人惊讶，并且立即产生了影响，基本上关闭了所有主要电影制作并影响了未来的上映时间表。许多相同的问题，特别是流媒体残差和人工智能，在两组谈判中都处于危险之中，这可能就是为什么 AMPTP 不愿意与 SAG 快速讨价还价的原因——它知道 WGA 可以利用这一点作为杠杆。相反，好莱坞大佬们似乎陷入了死亡漩涡，除了对工会和他们自己施加惩罚之外，不知道如何推动达成协议。<br><br>在这一点上，解决罢工问题的任何拖延对电影业来说都可能是世界末日。如果电影公司将谈判推迟数月，试图迫使工会陷入绝望，那么这些电影公司的产品最终将被电影院扣留，整体票房收入将直线下降，而这可能是好莱坞达到大流行前水平的最佳机会成功的喜悦将会溜走。是的， <em>《芭比娃娃》</em>和<em>《奥本海默》</em>将继续售票，八月份的几部动作片（ <em>《忍者神龟</em>》、 <em>《巨齿鲨 2</em> 》）应该会取得一定的成功，但目前所有关于票房的公司都将很快就忘记了。好莱坞刚刚得到了自 2019 年以来最明确的确认：电影仍然可以吸引现场观众。继续释放它们是个好主意。<br><br></div>

Archive</figcaption></figure><strong><em>本文包含电影</em></strong><strong>《芭比娃娃》的剧透<em>。</em></strong><br><br>当我问起有关肯的问题时，我与格蕾塔·葛韦格的电话就挂断了。当<em>《芭比娃娃》</em>的编剧兼导演回来时，她不知道发生了什么。我建议，<em>仅仅</em>提及肯——瑞恩·高斯林扮演的那个憔悴且被忽视的娃娃——当然会导致某种失败。葛韦格同意了。 “世界就像，<em>我不在乎</em>，”她开玩笑说。<br><br>但全世界都非常关心他所出演的电影。自周五上映以来， <em>《芭比娃娃》的</em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/24/1189760422/barbie-oppenheimer-box-office-ticket-sales">表现超出了预期</a>，成为第一部首周末票房超过 1 亿美元的工作室喜剧，并创下北美首映票房最高纪录。一位女导演。观众——其中许多人从头到脚都穿着粉红色——挤满了剧院，据报道甚至导致剧院到周六晚上就<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/23/movies/barbie-oppenheimer-box-office-numbers.html">没有优惠了</a>。<br><br> <em>《芭比娃娃</em>》的大规模首映使这部电影成为葛韦格作为导演迄今为止最成功的票房作品。然而，这部电影完全符合葛韦格的全部作品：就像 2017 年的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/lady-bird-greta-gerwig-review/544721/"><em>《伯德小姐</em></a>》和 2019 年的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/"><em>《小妇人》</em></a>一样，它深入思考了如何表达女性气质。葛韦格与搭档诺亚·鲍姆巴赫 (Noah Baumbach) 共同创作的<em>《芭比娃娃》的分量</em>可能出乎意料地沉重。在闪闪发光的服装和盛大派对的背后是一个可爱的人文主义故事，它研究产品如何影响和反映我们是谁。<br><br>也许这听起来很崇高，但考虑一下芭比（玛格特·罗比饰）和肯在现实世界中的冒险，这在电影中不仅仅是鱼出水狂欢的机会。两人肩负着在一个对待男性和女性不同的社会中生存的艰巨任务：芭比作为一个代表理想女性的玩具，与她有缺陷的目的作斗争；肯（Ken）是专为芭比娃娃的手臂糖果而创造的，他通过观察人类第一次尝到了力量的滋味，并误解了他所看到的。<em>芭比娃娃</em>既顽皮又深思熟虑，充满笑话，常常超现实的奇观包裹着真诚、女权主义和彻底的葛韦格风格的核心。<br><br>然而，当我们周五早上交谈时，葛韦格并不知道<em>芭比娃娃</em>会如何着陆。正如她所说，她预计自己会“整天焦虑不安”，并且渴望聊天，而不是担心电影的反响。我们讨论了她电影中的主题，以及她在芭比乐园的经历教会了她什么。 （别担心，Ken 的粉丝们。我们最终会找到他的。）<br><br><em>为了篇幅和清晰度，本次对话已被编辑。</em><br><br><strong>雪莉·李：</strong>这部<em>芭比娃娃</em>电影中有很多关于自我价值的重要想法，以及我们消费的东西（或者玩玩偶的东西）如何影响我们成为什么样的人。我注意到一个小女孩在放映时问了很多问题；她似乎对那些令人兴奋的主题感到有点困惑，但玩得很开心，尤其是当娃娃们唱歌跳舞时。所以我很好奇：当你和诺亚写这部电影时，你把谁想象成你的观众？<br><br><strong>格蕾塔·葛韦格：</strong>我并没有强烈的感觉，<em>这是给孩子们的东西；这是给孩子们看的。这是成人的东西</em>。我知道有些东西更令人兴奋，但当我回顾小时候的观看经历时，往往那些超出我范围的东西是最引人注目的，因为它们感觉就像一扇小窗户，让我进入了我所看到的世界。正在兴起。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>比如什么？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>这是一个非常奇怪、非常具体的记忆，但当我五岁的时候，我爸爸在纽约工作，我和妈妈得到了去<em>吉普赛</em>的加急票。我大部分都听不懂，但是当吉普赛<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wErVF7QwIY&amp;ab_channel=ProjectUnleash">在滑稽俱乐部表演</a>时，这些脱衣舞娘穿着闪闪发光的老式脱衣舞服装，我很喜欢。我不明白发生了什么，但我们得到了一本很大的纪念书，我记得只是研究了所有脱衣舞娘所在的页面，因为我认为它们是<em>如此</em>美丽。我没有任何感觉他们被客观化了。我只是喜欢他们穿着这些漂亮、闪闪发光的衣服和大头饰。我可能有很多这样的回忆。<br><br><strong>李：</strong> <em>《伯德小姐》</em>是根据你自己的经历写的， <em>《小妇人</em>》是你从小就喜欢看的书，小时候也玩过芭比娃娃。用你的电影来重温童年的试金石对你来说是一个有意的选择吗？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>老实说，在制作它们的过程中，我一直隐藏着一些东西，因为从表面上看，它们看起来很不同。但现在我看完了这个，我发现他们都在围绕着这个想法。 [<em>笑。</em> 】 你对你感兴趣的东西感兴趣，我对女人感兴趣。但我也认为——这听起来有点愚蠢——我的一个痴迷，可以说是，我真的有点不敢相信我们生活在线性时间里。 [<em>笑。</em> ] 这真是令人震惊。显然，当你有一个孩子时，你会与这个孩子紧密相连，但你在生活中也可以与它相连。<br><br>我认为，在试图将它们整合在一起并了解你现在在哪里以及你曾经去过哪里的过程中，总是会感到<em>痛苦</em>。显然，这就是我改编<em>《小妇人》</em>的方式，因为我突然<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/">以一种我年轻时从未见过的方式将这些角色视为</a>成年人。 <em>《伯德小姐》</em>是一个关于一名高中生的故事，有些事情你觉得很重要，比如舞会，但实际上这是关于你的母亲和你的<em>离开</em>。这是我回归的话题，因为无论如何，电影本质上就是一个时间胶囊，所以它已经及时处理了。这就是我在智力和艺术上感兴趣的东西，而媒介本身似乎已经嵌入了这一点。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/">阅读：格蕾塔·葛韦格的<em>《小妇人》</em>终于给了艾米应得的</a><br><br><strong>李：</strong>也许更好的说法是：你的电影都是关于女孩如何学习成为女人的。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>哦，<em>是的</em>！<br><br><strong>李：</strong>我是不是把事情想得太简单了？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>不，我喜欢它！那好美丽。 [<em>笑。</em> ] 不过，也许这就是你永远要做的事情。我不知道那是你到达的地方。这当然与年龄无关，因为它永远在展开。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>那么，你对少女时代最关心的是什么，拍这些电影也许可以帮助你理解？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>嗯，把它拆开是很困难的，但对我来说，这很大程度上与代际对话有关。当我想到我的祖母、我的母亲、我的时候，女性的生活已经发生了如此巨大的变化，我不知道接下来会发生什么变化，但我们不断互相学习。再过一周我就满 40 岁了，我开始以一种美妙的方式感觉到，我属于年轻女性回望的那一代，这种感觉美妙又奇怪。我确实认为这是一种让我能够深入地参与对话的方式，让我感觉值得拥有，无论是女性气质、人格还是线性时间中的存在。 [<em>笑。</em> ] 线性时间是我真正的一个难题。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>你说过制作这部电影就像你制作的任何其他电影一样个人化。有没有一个场景让你觉得这部电影对你来说非常个人化？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>从<em>芭比娃娃</em>徽标的字体（我一直被泡泡字母版本所吸引，部分原因是我在玩具“反”斗城看到的那个字体）到凯特·麦金农（Kate McKinnon）的角色非常重要这一事实，一切都包罗万象。反映了我拥有的芭比娃娃，一个被人喜爱的娃娃，但在盒子里不再处于原始完美的状态。芭比在长凳上看到的那个女人是我的朋友，杰出的服装设计师安·罗斯。我一直在思考面孔，当你看着她的面孔时，我想你看到了一种感觉就像是一种生活，而那个年龄不仅在其持续时间上有价值。<br><br> [当芭比娃娃和她的创造者牵手时]，所有这些视频剪辑都是从所有参与这部电影的人那里拍摄的——女性、母亲、姐妹、女儿、朋友。我坚信，即使你不知道电影中的内容，我认为你也能感受到它们。我一直很喜欢在<em>《好家伙》</em>中，马丁·斯科塞斯的母亲扮演妈妈。你不知道那是他的妈妈，但你觉得她就是那个人，而且感觉很私人。在某种程度上，这与一个孩子看电影时无法理解每一个参考内容，但以某种方式<em>感受到</em>它并没有什么不同。其中嵌入的个人信息是人们无意识收集的一部分。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>说到那些视频片段，我们再谈谈结局。你能告诉我关于让芭比娃娃和肯夫妇达成的决定吗？这不是一个最终的解决方案，而是一种缓和的方式？伊萨·雷饰演的芭比总统不允许肯在最高法院任职。他们还在想办法。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>我们<em>都</em>还在想办法——这只是其中的一部分。但我唯一能给任何人的就是他们仍然处于混乱之中。也许这对肯斯来说会好一点。你不想告诉人们如何观看事物，但在电影的结尾，制作设计将肯的一些迷恋融入了芭比乐园。就像，完美​​并不像开始将所有东西混合在一起那样美丽。我记得当我们去拍摄结局时，当我们都走在片场时，我们就像，<em>这是有史以来最美丽的</em>。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>你能告诉我为什么肯最终拒绝父权制吗？有趣的是，他承认他不明白。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong> [<em>沉默</em>]<br><br><strong>李：</strong>哦，不。格蕾塔，我失去你了吗？你好？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>嗨，好吧，我不知道发生了什么事。它就这样消失了。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>没关系。我觉得很有趣的是，一个关于肯的问题导致你挂断了电话。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong> [<em>笑。</em> ] 世界就像是，“我不在乎。”<br><br><strong>李：</strong>是的，“我们继续吧。”所以我想问：肯实际上并不想接管芭比乐园的想法从何而来？这部电影小心翼翼地将他描绘成一个被误导的反派，而不是一个怀恨在心的对手。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>嗯，在某种程度上，你会无意识地做事情，然后再将它们拼凑起来，但有一个元素让你感觉最后，你想要从自己手中被拯救出来。我猜它的黑暗反乌托邦版本是<em>《蝇王》</em> ，就像《野孩子》一样。他们是洋娃娃，但在心理上他们也是孩子。<br><br>事实上，我想到了我的继子。当他年轻的时候，他只是不睡觉。有一次，我走进他的卧室，他站在床上，把他的毛绒玩具扔来扔去，他尖叫道：“我希望有人能让我停下来！”它是如此纯粹[<em>笑</em>]，就像，实际上，他是对的！他希望有人能让他停下来。当瑞恩·高斯林和我谈论他将如何演绎结局时，我谈到了很多关于我 4 岁儿子的事。如果他哭了，你说：“哈罗德，我们不得不离开公园，你感到不安吗？”他会说：“是啊啊，是啊啊。”就像，他承认[他的悲伤]，但即使只是这样做也<em>很难</em>，那种情感的品质。<br><br>显然，这些系统对男性来说也很糟糕。当<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">美国发表美丽的演讲</a>时，我只是在抽泣，然后我环顾四周，发现片场里每个人都在哭。男人们也在哭，因为他们有自己的演讲，他们觉得自己永远无法发表，你知道吗？他们有自己的双钢丝，这也很痛苦。其中一些结构就是，你知道，“有人让我停下来！”我想这就是肯背后的感觉。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">阅读：理解<em>芭比</em>电影的令人惊讶的关键</a><br><br><strong>李：</strong>这是一部如此庞大的电影，也是你职业生涯中压力很大的时刻。作为一个电影人，你现在掌握着很大的权力，我想问你打算用它做什么？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong> [<em>笑。</em> ]<em>我想做什么？</em>成为一名电影制片人是一件了不起的事情，因为拍电影很困难，你永远无法真正登上山顶。因为无论你接下来要制作什么，你都还没有制作过——所以你会学到关于<em>这部</em>电影你不知道的东西，你知道吗？这很困难，但这也是吸引力的一部分。但是，如果你幸运的话，你只会每两年、三年、四年拍一部电影。所以，如果你开始计算人生，你就会意识到，<em>我要做什么，拍 15 部电影？</em>你知道，不是太多。但如果我幸运的话，我就能过上一种像我希望做的任何事情一样有意义的生活。我<em>确实</em>想在 60 多岁和 70 多岁时拍电影，如果上帝愿意，也许我会在 80 多岁时拍一些极其奇怪的电影。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>既然你已经完成了大预算工作室的主力，你认为你的故事讲述会如何发展？我想你并不总是在做生活中的数学。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>我希望能够制作各种规模的电影。我喜欢拥有制作微小东西的技能，也喜欢拥有用最大的画笔绘画的技能。它总是关于什么能给你最大的创造性自由，这可能意味着不同的事情。<br><br>我也感到非常幸运，能够成长为更大的人。我在 20 多岁的时候与人共同编剧、共同导演、演过很多戏，我就是利用这些来开始执导的。 <em>《小妇人》</em>是一个中间步骤，当我想到年轻的电影制作人时，取决于你想做什么，如果你有兴趣看看它如何扩展或收缩，那么这些中级电影的制作是令人难以置信的。我非常感激我能做到这一点，因为没有它我就不可能做到<em>这一点</em>。<br><br></div>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israels-majoritarian-nightmare-should-be-a-us-concern/">一项全面计划</a>的第一个要素，该计划旨在削减对以色列政府权力的几乎所有限制，而该计划已经很广泛了。<br><br>内塔尼亚胡通常是一位谨慎的领导人，七个月内对以色列社会造成的分裂比他之前的任何一位总理都多，扩大并暴露了他的支持者和对手之间的深深鸿沟。结果，以色列街头上演了一场史无前例的政治戏剧，工商界、学术界、医疗机构、工会等领导人抗议他的议程。<br><br>最值得注意的是，大量预备役军人已宣布打算停止志愿服务，这与拒绝服兵役的命令不同，而没有人建议这样做。这些志愿者包括数百名依赖预备役的空军军人。正如我的布鲁金斯学会同事阿莫斯·哈雷尔在《国土<a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-733756">道歉</a>中，斯莫特里奇表达了他的震惊，因为他被理解为他所说的正是他所说的。然而，他确实阐明了令军队中许多人感到恐惧的事情。斯莫特里奇曾经是一名边缘极右翼活动人士，现在已成为一名高级内阁部长，在一个内阁是军队集体总司令的国家。斯莫特里奇的朋友解释说，飞行员和其他军队人员拥有强大的火力，他们依靠政治领导和国家机构只发布道德上站得住脚的命令。鉴于内塔尼亚胡内阁成员采取的极端立场，以及其大力限制对其权力的一切检查，军事人员只能猜测内阁高级部长是否真的计划命令他们犯下战争罪。对于许多人来说，这种情况变得难以维持。<br><br>更广泛地说，许多以色列人感觉到社会契约的崩溃。如果以色列不完全民主，那么这个将极其<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tribes-identity-and-individual-freedom-in-israel/">多元化的</a>犹太人口聚集在一起的国家就会崩溃。对于以色列的阿拉伯公民来说，在以色列社会中寻找自己的位置的斗争更加困难，但他们近年来的经济、社会和政治成就也受到威胁，因为司法限制了通常将他们排除在外的政治多数派的统治被删除。<br><br>内塔尼亚胡的支持者也感受到了危机。他们认为反对改革的抗议活动的广度和强度，以及预备役军人拒绝志愿服务，都是颠覆多数统治的努力。他们认为，他们赢得了上次选举，而现在反对派正在利用选举外的手段来阻止他们偏爱的政策得到实施。在他们自己的抗议活动中，他们拥抱了“二等公民”的口号，抱怨他们的选票价值较低，他们的选举授权被视为非法。平均而言，内塔尼亚胡的支持者来自社会经济地位较低的阶层，他们认为，面对有利于内塔尼亚胡联盟的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqulftg2">人口</a>趋势，老牌精英正在努力保持对国家的控制。<br><br>忽视<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://en.idi.org.il/articles/47968">少数人</a>的观点将是一个错误，但其叙述存在两个重大缺陷。首先，内塔尼亚胡政府不仅推行一系列有争议的政策，而且寻求实施宪法改革。在选举中获得微弱多数不足以对一个国家的宪法进行彻底的修改。以色列法律赋予少数或临时多数与广泛联盟相同的宪法权力，并允许迅速修改宪法，但它仍然应该寻求共识并实行自我克制，这不仅是为了公平，也是为了维护政体的完整性。<br><br>其次，内塔尼亚胡和他的许多支持者将多数主义与民主混为一谈。这些不是同一件事。正如我在二月份<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israels-majoritarian-nightmare-should-be-a-us-concern/">所写的</a>，民主是人民的统治，是<em>人民</em>的统治，包括少数人在内的所有人的统治。民主并不是让大多数人在没有护栏的情况下为所欲为的许可证。<br><br>内塔尼亚胡的支持者经常声称他们没有暴虐的意图。无论私下还是公开场合，他们都会<a data-event-element="inline link"

He opposed the development of a much more powerful, second-generation atomic weapon—the hydrogen bomb, which Edward Teller called the “super”—in part because he was concerned it would accelerate an arms race with the Soviet Union. He also lent his prestige and credibility to ongoing efforts to avoid that arms race altogether. He helped draft the proposals that evolved into the Baruch Plan, an arms-control regime that the United States put before the United Nations. Under the latter&#39;s direction, all countries would forfeit their atomic-weapons programs, and atomic energy would be a global collective good, administered by a centralized regulatory body at the UN, over which no country would enjoy a veto.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/07/us-nuclear-strategy-cold-war-russia/638441/">Read: We have no nuclear strategy</a><br><br> After the final failure of these proposals at the UN, in 1948, Oppenheimer turned, as one does, to <em>The Atlantic</em> . His essay is a fascinating historical artifact and act of public grief. Titled “The Open Mind,” it lays out Oppenheimer&#39;s account of the back-and-forth over arms-control proposals. Soviet leaders had voted against them, but their response had not been wholly negative. They agreed that all countries should dismantle their atomic-weapons programs and that atomic energy should fall under international oversight. But they objected, perhaps understandably, to America&#39;s insistence on keeping its weapons program running until the new system was functional. They wanted President Harry Truman to disarm first, a condition that he could not abide.<br><br> During the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer&#39;s powers of foresight had failed him. However accurate his calculations concerning the innards of the atom, he&#39;d misjudged what would happen geopolitically after he and his colleagues wrenched it apart. Out of naivete, or the expedient blindness of ambition, or some combination of the two, he may have believed that he could stop its further use after the Nazis had been defeated, or that the terrifying spectacle of the bomb would eventually lead to a renunciation of ever larger weapons and wars.<br><br> In 1949, he understood that no such renunciation was in store. “We see no clear course before us that would persuade the governments of the world to join with us” in atomic disarmament, he wrote. This time, the implications were obvious, and they implicated America, which, as Oppenheimer laments, “responded by adopting some of the very measures that we had hoped might be universally renounced.” The mass manufacture of the atomic bomb was under way and American scientists had clear orders to put the new physics in service of even more destructive weapons.<br><br> Oppenheimer saw a cosmically bleak arms race taking shape, and this time his  foresight proved accurate. Within months, the Soviet Union successfully tested its first atomic bomb, and only three years later, in 1952, the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb roughly 500 times as powerful as the one that had largely destroyed Nagasaki. The Soviets followed suit a few years later, and by the time of Oppenheimer&#39;s death, in 1967, the two countries had nearly 40,000 nuclear weapons between them, many of them <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">set on a hair trigger</a> .<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">Read: Never give artificial intelligence the nuclear codes</a><br><br> Oppenheimer knew that he&#39;d helped to conjure this world into existence. He sought to prepare our readers for its horrors. In the main, his advice was to not lose hope, and to remember that our imagination of the future is limited. Oppenheimer was perhaps heartened by the quantum world, shot through as it is with uncertainty, that had captivated him in his youth. He seemed to draw strength from a belief that the macro world of human affairs is likewise contingent, such that nothing about our fate is ever settled.<br><br> Oppenheimer quotes from a speech that Abraham Lincoln gave in Baltimore three years into the Civil War. At the beginning of that conflict, few expected that “domestic slavery would be much affected,” Lincoln said, and yet it had been. Reality is unpredictable; it will surprise you. Lincoln reminded Oppenheimer that surprises swing both ways. A world that appears to be fallen can sometimes veer toward moral progress.<br><br> We have seen such swerves before, even in the nuclear realm. By the 1980s, enormous arsenals of nuclear weapons appeared to be a fact of life on planet Earth. In 1986, the Soviet Union&#39;s stockpile reached an all-time high of about 40,000 warheads, and the United States had more than 20,000. Very few people imagined that the end of the Cold War was imminent. Nor could many have guessed that in 1991, George HW Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev would sign the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the first in an extraordinary sequence of agreements that shrank the two countries&#39; arsenals to less than a quarter of their previous size.<br><br> Bush and Gorbachev were wise to seize the day, because that era&#39;s peace—and its clean two-party strategic symmetry—proved ephemeral. The specter of nuclear annihilation has since returned with force to the global collective psyche. Vladimir Putin has invoked it in speeches about his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://Read:%20What%20if%20Russia%20uses%20nuclear%20weapons%20in%20Ukraine?">invasion of Ukraine</a> . China has built up an arsenal that may be large enough to destroy every major American city.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/russia-ukraine-nuclear-weapon-us-response/661315/">Read: What if Russia uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine?</a><br><br> As Oppenheimer well understood, there is no <em>technological</em> reason that world-threatening stockpiles of nuclear weapons will not be with us for hundreds of thousands of years. To keep large numbers of them in place for that long, in a strategic setting where any small exchange could very easily become a large one, is to play a fool&#39;s game. No one should feel safe because seven decades have passed without another incident of nuclear warfare; that sample size is too small.<br><br> Beyond advising hope, Oppenheimer didn&#39;t offer much guidance as to how we might dismantle the sword of Damocles that he helped to string up above human civilization. A notorious dandy and eloquent impromptu speaker, he was always drawn to style; in his <em>Atlantic</em> essay, he invokes it in a higher form. “It is style,” he wrote, “which, in the domain of foreign policy, enables us to find a harmony between the pursuit of ends essential to us, and the regard for the views, the sensibilities, the aspirations of those to whom the problem may appear in another light.”<br><br> The problem Oppenheimer had in mind was arms control. He asked that those who negotiate on America&#39;s behalf carry out their work in a spirit of openness. He asked that they appeal to the reasoning minds of those who sit across the table. He appears to have believed—or to have wanted to believe—that a widespread adoption of this style might be enough to set into motion a new evolutionary step in geopolitics, through which the world&#39;s major powers might come to a shared understanding that peace is the highest wisdom. To this end, he counseled patience. Time and nature must be allowed to do their work, he noted. Seven decades on, it looks to be slow work indeed.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 17:41:20 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/j-robert-oppenheimer-ideas-history/674814/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/j-robert-oppenheimer-ideas-history/674814/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Elon Killed the Bird]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Three theories about Twitter&#39;s seemingly nonsensical rebrand to X <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/JZeYzwBTVyFMw8BhsJxJAECy7ms=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/twitter_X_horz/original.jpg" alt="Twitter 的鸟标志位于 X 上方" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Ben Kothe / The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> In May, Elon Musk presided over an uncharacteristically subtle tweak to Twitter&#39;s home page. For years, the prompt in the text box at the top of the page read, “What&#39;s happening?,” a friendly invitation for users to share their thoughts. Eight months after the billionaire&#39;s takeover, Twitter <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/05/12/heres-how-twitters-appearance-has-changed-under-elon-musk/?sh=76231c985f68">changed</a> the prompt ever so slightly to match the puzzling, chaotic nature of the platform under the new regime: “What&#39;s happening?” became “What is happening?!”<br><br> This question, with its exclamatory urgency, has never been more relevant to Twitter than in the past 48 hours, when Musk decided to nuke 17 years&#39; worth of brand awareness and rename the thing. The artist formerly known as Twitter is now X. <em>What is happening?!</em> indeed.<br><br> I have three answers to that question, beyond the simple “Nothing much.” (Even with its new name, the site is pretty much the same as ever; the blue bird logo in the left-hand corner of the website is now a black <em>X</em> , and … that&#39;s about it.) This X boondoggle may simply be the flailing of a man who doesn&#39;t want to own his social network and was pressured via lawsuit to buy it, but Musk and the Twitter (X?) CEO, Linda Yaccarino, would like you to believe that much bigger things are coming.<br><br> <strong>1. Musk wants to build the “Internet of Elon.”</strong><br><br> The first theory requires taking Musk&#39;s ambitions somewhat seriously. In a tweet last October, he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633">declared</a> that “buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Versions of these “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/18/23687125/elon-musk-twitter-x-super-app-wechat">super apps</a> ” already exist and are popular in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, so we know what this means: X would function as a holistic platform that includes payment processing and banking, ride-sharing, news, communication with friends, and loads and loads of commerce. Think of it as the internet, but without leaving Musk&#39;s walled garden. In a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23171541/leaked-transcript-elon-musk-first-meeting-twitter-employees">leaked</a> recording of a Twitter town hall back in June 2022, Musk hinted that China&#39;s WeChat was a model of sorts for X. “There&#39;s no WeChat movement outside of China,” he said. “And I think that there&#39;s a real opportunity to create that. You basically live on WeChat in China because it&#39;s so useful and so helpful to your daily life. And I think if we could achieve that, or even close to that with Twitter, it would be an immense success.”<br><br> If you squint, you can see the logic. Plenty of people across Twitter—influencers, freelancers, small-business owners—use the platform to sell things. Many of these people use various “link in bio” pages to direct people to their work and receive payment. X, the theoretical everything app, could streamline and consolidate these exchanges, and, like WeChat, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/">generate revenue</a> from them. Musk has already launched a program to share ad revenue with some of Twitter&#39;s larger “creator” accounts, the early beneficiaries of which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/twitter-creators-payments-right-wing/">included</a> many prominent right-wing shock jocks. And if he could manage to get hundreds of millions of people to live and shop and bank on his app, instead of, say, shitpost memes and argue politics with white nationalists, that would be an immense success.<br><br> To do that, X would need to build out an advanced, secure payment platform; apply the appropriate regulatory licenses to legally process payments and store money; and, of course, recruit businesses and financial institutions to use the platform. According to the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/9d84d534-b2dd-4cff-85d1-aee137b26a45"><em>Financial Times</em></a> , the company began filing applications for those licenses early this year and has been at work building parts of a payment infrastructure. The bad news is that the person Musk tasked with spearheading the project was laid off—along with about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html">80 percent</a> of Twitter&#39;s workforce.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/elon-musk-twitter-ethics-algorithm-biases/673110/">Read: I watched Elon Musk kill Twitter&#39;s culture from the inside</a><br><br> Musk does have experience in the payments business. He founded an online bank—also called X.com—in 1999, and it shortly thereafter merged with Confinity to become PayPal. Perhaps this would give his super-app idea some credibility, if not for Musk having spent the past 15 months blundering through his latest business venture in full view of the public. He has alienated advertisers with his reactionary and conspiratorial political opinions, sent the company deep into debt, and, at times, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-outage-elon-musk-user-restrictions/674609/">rendered the platform unusable</a> by limiting how many tweets users can see. The platform appears to be shrinking under Musk&#39;s leadership, according to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-traffic-falls-under-elon-musk-threads-mastodon-bluesky-competition/">third-party</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1678065025750294532?s=20">traffic data</a> . Spam <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/09/technology/elon-musk-twitter-spam-bots.html">is</a> rampant, and the most satisfied users seem to be previously banned racists and anti-Semites who have regained access to their megaphone.<br><br> It&#39;s already a hard sell for Musk to convince people that his sputtering platform is the best place for posting <em>Barbenheimer</em> memes, let alone the right home for … everything, including our money. But the cognitive dissonance between Musk&#39;s reputational hemorrhaging and his grand ambitions is easier to bridge when you consider the second way to explain X, which is that it&#39;s a desperate shot in the dark.<br><br> <strong>2. X is <em>pseudoware</em> —just buzzwords and a logo.</strong><br><br> Unlike Facebook&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg/620538/">pivot to Meta</a> , which was oriented around a real (though flawed and unappealing) virtual-reality product, X is a rebrand built on little more than a vague collection of buzzwords cobbled together to form a complete sentence. On Sunday, Yaccarino <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213895463215104?s=20">described</a> the forthcoming app as “the future state of unlimited interactivity” that is “centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking—creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.” She also noted that, “powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we&#39;re just beginning to imagine.” (Yaccarino did not respond to a request for comment.)<br><br> Her tweet is a near-perfect example of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/630ec150bcbd490021b17eab/business-dudes-need-to-stop-talking-like-this/">business-dude <em>lorem ipsum</em></a> —corporate gibberish that sounds superficially intelligent but is actually obfuscating. What is “unlimited interactivity?” How will X be “powered by AI”? Does she mean generative AI like ChatGPT or standard algorithms of the sort that have powered Twitter&#39;s “For you” feed for years? The particulars are irrelevant: The words just need to sound like <em>something</em> when strung together.<br><br> Musk, too, is guilty of such blabber. He has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1683324036950966273?s=20">argued</a> that his hypothetical project, if built correctly, could “become half of the global financial system.” This is the empty language of a dilettante, the equivalent of me telling you that this article, if written correctly, is on pace to win the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism, or that I am the executive wordsmith for <em>The Atlantic</em> ’s Words About Computers section.<br><br> Musk&#39;s and Yaccarino&#39;s descriptions of X don&#39;t just suggest <em>vaporware</em> , an industry term for a hyped-up product that never materializes. They feel like something else, too: I&#39;d call it <em>pseudoware</em> . Like a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/6258e039dc551a00208cc5e1/elon-musk-meme-stocks-and-retail-investing-for-the-superrich/">pseudo-event</a> , pseudoware masquerades as something newsworthy, even though it is not. Yaccarino&#39;s Mad Libs–ian tweetstorm is the press release for this pseudo-event: big talk for a pivot that has so far manifested in ornamental changes. Musk&#39;s first orders of business have been to adopt a new logo and to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1683541303680987136?s=20">project</a> it in conference rooms at headquarters. When Yaccarino tweeted that “X will connect us all in ways we&#39;re just beginning to imagine,” I take her at her word: No one seems to have spent much time thinking about any of this.<br><br> It&#39;s natural to wonder why the world&#39;s richest man would spend his time dismantling one of the world&#39;s most recognizable social-media brands in favor of an inscrutable super app nobody asked for. He could, at any moment, jet off to a private island and drink bottomless piña coladas while giggling about Dogecoin instead! Herein lies the third and most important explanation for X, which is that it is a reputational line of credit for Musk.<br><br> <strong>3. Musk needs to save face.</strong><br><br> Musk&#39;s reputation is dependent on people believing that he can gin up new categories of industry and see around corners to build futuristic stuff. His $44 billion acquisition of Twitter was marketed with a visionary framework: Musk would realize Twitter&#39;s dreams of being a truly global town square and solve the intractable problems of free speech at scale. Having failed at that, Musk is, in essence, going back to basics with X—it&#39;s an opportunity to remake the internet in his own image.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-outage-elon-musk-user-restrictions/674609/">Read: Elon Musk really broke Twitter this time</a><br><br> As <em>Bloomberg</em> ’s Max Chafkin <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/chafkin/status/1683475959981264900/photo/2">pointed out</a> , Musk&#39;s original X.com brand was a total failure. He was obsessed with the name and the web address, but consumers, not illogically, associated the brand with adult-entertainment sites. Musk was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-elon-musk-fired-from-paypal/">ousted</a> by X.com&#39;s board after the merger in 2000, a year before the service was renamed PayPal, but the payment company remains an important part of his legacy. X, then, is a callback to a younger version of the entrepreneur—one who is associated with success, products that work, and generous investor returns.

Musk is behaving much like a start-up with an unsustainable burn rate—he needs a cash injection.

Its ambitions are so vague as to be boundless, which signals perpetual growth and moneymaking—it is, quite literally, the <em>everything</em> app. In this way, X is an inkblot test for anyone who still wants to believe in Musk: Squint the right way and X takes on the form of whatever hopes and dreams that person has for the future of the internet.

The three stout towers, each 435 feet high, buckled at the waist in synchrony, then crumpled like crushed soda cans. Within 10 seconds, they&#39;d collapsed into a billowing cloud of dust.<br><br> To anyone who watched the demolition happen, or saw the footage online, the message was clear: TVA, a sprawling, federally owned utility created 90 years ago as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal, is getting off coal.<br><br> Though some people in the region regret that move, it&#39;s a win for the local environment—and for the global climate. In the past few years, as the urgency of slowing climate change has grown, something like a consensus has emerged on how to do it: Green the electrical grid while retooling as much of the economy as possible—cars, buildings, factories—to run on zero-carbon electricity. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden last August, is supporting that plan with $370 billion in subsidies. In a 2021 executive order, Biden directed the federal government to “lead by example in order to achieve a carbon pollution–free electricity sector by 2035” and a net-zero economy by 2050.<br><br> Given this strategy, electric utilities are crucial to our future—and none more so than TVA, the largest public power provider in the United States. Its territory covers nearly all of Tennessee; large chunks of Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky; and bits of three other states. In one of the most conservative regions of the country, 10 million people get electricity from a federal agency that has no shareholders to answer to and no profits to make.<br><br> “TVA is this crazy unicorn—it&#39;s not like anything else,” Stephen Smith, the executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, told me. As a federal agency responsible not just for promoting the clean-energy transition but for building it, TVA is positioned to provide a national model—and TVA says it is doing just that.<br><br> But that&#39;s not how Smith and other environmental advocates describe TVA&#39;s behavior. They see a utility that is replacing coal plants, at Paradise and elsewhere, with gas-burning plants that will pollute the climate for decades. They see a utility betting heavily on small nuclear reactors that don&#39;t yet exist. Above all, they say, TVA is failing to embrace proven clean-energy technologies, such as solar and wind power and energy-efficiency measures.<br><br> “TVA is a living laboratory that could be part of a phenomenal push to change to clean energy,” Smith said. Instead of an agency “on a war footing to get us to zero carbon,” he sees it becoming “an impediment in the executive branch.”<br><br> TVA has cut its carbon emissions by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental-stewardship/sustainability/carbon-report">well over half since 2005</a> , far more than the nationwide average for the electricity sector, while charging lower-than-average rates. It has done so by replacing coal with gas and by switching on a large new nuclear reactor. But like most American utilities, TVA has no plans to reach Biden&#39;s goal of a net-zero grid by 2035; it&#39;s targeting only an 80 percent carbon reduction by that date. “We aspire to net-zero by 2050, and we aspire to go farther, faster, if we can,” Jeff Lyash, TVA&#39;s president and CEO since 2019, said at a meeting of the agency&#39;s board of directors in November. With existing technology, though, he doesn&#39;t think that&#39;s possible.<br><br> What&#39;s the right road to net-zero? The Tennessee Valley is an illuminating microcosm of a national debate, in which the imperative of addressing climate change is pitted against the enormous practical challenge of not only maintaining a reliable electric supply but dramatically expanding it to meet the needs of a decarbonizing economy. “TVA is in a unique position to lead in delivering the clean-energy future,” Lyash said in November. He and his critics agree on that much. But as for when that future will arrive, and what it will look like, they are very far apart indeed.<br><br>时间<br><br><span class="smallcaps">VA was born</span> from another global crisis. In 1933, when Roosevelt and Senator George Norris, a Nebraska Republican, persuaded Congress to establish TVA, the United States was at the nadir of the Great Depression, and the Tennessee Valley, where only a tiny percentage of the homes had electricity, was one of the country&#39;s poorest regions. TVA transformed it. Starting with the Wilson Dam, at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, a series of dams controlled flooding on the Tennessee River and its tributaries and electrified the whole Valley. Hydroelectric plants still produce about 10 percent of the region&#39;s power, carbon-free.<br><br> Private utilities hated TVA, and complained bitterly about what they saw as unfair competition. They challenged the agency&#39;s existence before the Supreme Court and lost, twice. As late as the 1950s, President Dwight Eisenhower wanted to sell off the agency, which he saw as an example of “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/18/archives/eisenhower-points-to-the-t-v-a-as-creeping-socialism-example.html">creeping socialism</a> .” The agency survived by becoming quasi-independent of the federal government. The president appoints and Congress confirms TVA&#39;s board, but since 1959, TVA has mostly done without federal appropriations. It pays its own way by selling electricity—not directly to consumers (aside from a few dozen industrial and federal properties), but to the 153 municipally or cooperatively owned local power companies, or LPCs, that distribute power to the people.<br><br> From the start, TVA&#39;s strategy was to make electricity cheap and accessible enough that people would use it for everything. The agency succeeded so well that demand soon outstripped what even a thoroughly dammed river could supply. In the &#39;50s, TVA began relying on coal as its main energy source, ultimately building 12 large power plants. Over the past decade, it has closed six, but giant piles of toxic ash remain. In 2008, a dike ruptured at the coal plant in Kingston, Tennessee, spilling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/coal-other-dark-side-toxic-ash?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1676993465551">more than 5 million cubic yards of ash</a> into the Emory and Clinch Rivers.<br><br> Environmentalists have long had reason to distrust TVA. In the &#39;70s, when the newly created Environmental Protection Agency began regulating air pollution, TVA resisted. Accustomed to making its own engineering decisions, it argued that investing in scrubbers for its coal stacks made no sense—after all, it was about to replace most of them with nuclear reactors. But the agency completed only seven of a planned 17 reactors—demand for electricity grew slower than forecast—and today, unfinished reactor hulks lie scattered around the Valley. The fiasco left TVA constrained by debt, which still totals nearly $20 billion.<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1962/04/the-rape-of-the-appalachians/658469/">From the April 1962 issue: Harry Caudill on TVA and the destruction of the Appalachian Mountains</a><br><br> Nevertheless, TVA is proud of its nuclear fleet. Although Georgia Power is expected to bring a new reactor online soon, TVA has been the only US utility to have managed that in the past three decades. It began construction on the two reactors at its Watts Bar plant, in Tennessee, in 1973; mothballed them for years; then completed them in 1996 and 2016. In the first half of 2023, they and the agency&#39;s other reactors helped it generate nearly 60 percent of its kilowatt-hours without emitting carbon—significantly higher than the national average. But it has “fumbled, failed, and flopped” into that enviable position, Stephen Smith told me. The climate crisis demands transformative change, Smith said, and TVA has abandoned its historic mission to provide precisely that.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n downtown Chattanooga</span> , the people directly responsible for delivering electricity to the Valley&#39;s 10 million residents sit in TVA&#39;s system-operations center. It&#39;s a large, hushed, dimly lit room, in which curving rows of workstations face a wall filled with an illuminated schematic of TVA&#39;s sprawling transmission grid. The first rows of operators track the physical condition and voltage of the transmission lines. The operators behind them “dispatch” power as needed from hundreds of generators around the grid, matching supply to demand minute by minute. That complex job is simplified by having lots of “dispatchable” power, which is what coal, gas, nuclear, and hydro plants provide, at least in principle: power that&#39;s available any time of the day or year.<br><br> In a conference room overlooking the control room, I met Greg Henrich and Aaron Melda, TVA&#39;s vice president and senior vice president for transmission and power supply. Melda had helped formulate the agency&#39;s decarbonization strategy, and he grabbed a marker to sketch out the numbers on a flip chart. The strategy&#39;s central element is the closure of TVA&#39;s last five coal plants, all more than 50 years old, by 2035. “Over the same period, we will add 10,000 megawatts of solar,” Melda said. To store energy for when the sun isn&#39;t shining, TVA will also add 1,000 megawatts of battery capacity.<br><br> Over the next decade, though, the agency&#39;s main carbon-reduction strategy is to build more gas plants—7,000 megawatts&#39; worth, roughly the capacity of the current coal fleet. When I visited the system-ops center last fall, TVA was finalizing plans for the latest addition: a 1,450-megawatt gas plant in Cumberland City, Tennessee, at the site of its biggest coal plant, whose two generating units are scheduled to retire in 2026 and 2028. Environmentalists strenuously opposed the gas plant—even the EPA questioned it—arguing that it would commit TVA to emitting carbon long past 2035 or even 2050. In the near term, though, the switch from coal will substantially reduce emissions of carbon and other pollutants. “You replace coal with gas, you&#39;ve now taken every one of those megawatts down 50 percent in its carbon intensity,” Melda said.<br><br> Why not just build more batteries and more solar, and take the intensity down to zero? It would cost a lot more, Melda said, and batteries discharge within several hours. A few rainy days could leave you unable to meet demand. Nor is solar a big help on dark winter mornings, which are the moments that TVA worries about most. The majority of homes in the Valley have electric heat. A spokesperson for TVA, Scott Fiedler, later said that gas is “the only mature technology that allows us to quickly add renewable energy and maintain the low cost and reliability” needed.<br><br> I visited the system-ops center on a chilly November day a week before Thanksgiving. Early that morning, as people cranked up their thermostat, TVA had seen a fairly typical winter peak in the load on its grid. Warmer weather was coming that would drive down demand, Henrich said, but it would rise again on Thanksgiving morning, as people roasted turkeys. That afternoon, the load would plummet. “Everybody&#39;s asleep on the couch,” Henrich said. “It&#39;s awesome to watch—it&#39;s truly societal behavior driving your load.”<br><br> He opened the blinds on the conference-room windows so we could see into the control room itself. It looked pretty quiet, with a lot of the workstations empty. “When does it ever get exciting?” I asked. A month later, my question was answered.<br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">n December 23</span> , people in the Tennessee Valley awoke to temperatures that had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/tennessee/2023/01/19/tva-blackouts-winter-storm-cold-aging-power-plants/69777671007/">plunged 40 degrees or more overnight</a> . Worse, both units of the Cumberland coal plant had shut down, because thick ice from a big storm had encased instruments on the exposed boilers. In the morning, the Bull Run coal plant wouldn&#39;t start, and some natural-gas plants failed too. As demand soared to an all-time winter record of 33,427 megawatts, the operators in Chattanooga found themselves about 8,000 megawatts short. Neighboring utilities couldn&#39;t help; the storm had affected half the country.<br><br> For two hours that morning, TVA had to instruct its 153 local power companies to cut demand by 5 percent. On Christmas Eve, it asked for a 10 percent cut for more than five hours. To comply, the LPCs shut off power neighborhood by neighborhood for 15 minutes or more at a time. The rolling blackouts were the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2023/jan/31/tva-looking-into-ways-to-avoid-future-outages-tfp/">first in TVA&#39;s 90-year history</a> . At Christmas dinner, Fiedler told me, his mother required him to explain why his storied organization had cut her power on the holiday. “She wore me out,” he said.<br><br> TVA likes to boast of its reliability, and environmental advocates seized on the Christmas failure. “The emperor has no clothes,” Amanda Garcia, the director of the Southern Environmental Law Center&#39;s Tennessee office, told me. “The winter storm to me provided a perfect example of why TVA needs to change”—by showing that fossil fuels are no guarantee of reliability and that it should be transitioning to renewables faster. The Sierra Club ranks TVA among the very worst American utilities for its energy transition. The Center for Biological Diversity calls it a “climate laggard.” Both want the agency to replace all its coal plants as soon as possible with renewable energy, not gas.<br><br> A modeling study released in March by the Center for Biological Diversity and by GridLab, a nonprofit consulting group, concluded that TVA could indeed stop burning both coal and gas by 2035. To do that, it would need to build the equivalent of about 145 large solar farms, with a total capacity of 35 gigawatts, in its territory, along with the transmission lines needed to import about 12 gigawatts of wind power from the Midwest. (The Valley isn&#39;t windy enough to produce cost-effective wind power.) Then, by 2050, it would have to nearly triple that expansion again in order to electrify and decarbonize the Valley&#39;s economy. The goals are ambitious, given the delays that now plague many renewable and transmission projects—but the benefits to society would dwarf the costs, the study found. Consumers would save more than $250 billion, mostly from switching to cars that run on TVA&#39;s electricity rather than gasoline. Carbon emissions would drop by hundreds of millions of tons.<br><br> The first step toward a clean-energy future, advocates agree, would be to reduce energy waste in the Valley. About a quarter of homes there rely on resistance heating—the method employed in electric furnaces and space heaters. Many heat pumps also fall back on it at freezing temperatures, Huntsville Utilities&#39; president and CEO, Wes Kelley, told me. “That is basically the equivalent of turning on a bunch of big hair dryers to heat your house,” Kelley said.<br><br> According to National Renewable Energy Laboratory <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://resstock.nrel.gov/factsheets/TN">estimates</a> , efficiency measures, including more and better heat pumps, could save roughly as much electricity as the Cumberland gas plant will generate. “If you reduce that resistance heating, you&#39;re helping the system as a whole”—by reducing the peak load—“as well as the customer,” Maggie Shober, the research director at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE), told me. Because people in the Valley use so much electricity, monthly bills are high even though rates are low, creating an especially heavy burden on the poor.<br><br> Utilities generally have little incentive to invest in energy-saving measures, which only reduce their revenue. But TVA should be different: It doesn&#39;t need to make a profit. Since 2018, it has run an admirable program, called Home Uplift, that provides heat pumps, weatherization, and other measures to low-income homeowners, all for free—but so far, only to 5,000 of the hundreds of thousands of Valley residents who might be eligible. TVA could do much more, SACE and other critics say, especially now that the Inflation Reduction Act is subsidizing energy-efficiency programs. For its part, TVA says it&#39;s planning more of these types of investments, including rebates to replace older and less efficient heat pumps. Fiedler, the TVA spokesperson, said the agency will lower energy costs in underserved communities by $200 million over the next five years through Home Uplift and other programs.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he environmental advocates</span> I talked with were all suspicious of TVA&#39;s clean-energy intentions. SACE&#39;s Stephen Smith, a close observer of the agency for more than three decades, thinks TVA is building gas plants now and planning nuclear for the future because large power plants are what it is comfortable building, and it has a monopoly on building them in the Valley. The future of the industry should lie in “shifting from central stations to a more distributed model that opens up a whole new powerful toolbox for fixing the climate crisis,” Smith said. “But TVA is not going there.”<br><br> He and other advocates see a “rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future,” to quote the most recent United Nations climate report, and in that stark light, TVA&#39;s current fleet of renewables looks inadequate, especially if you set aside the hydroelectric dams and focus on what it has achieved lately. It buys about 1,200 megawatts of wind from the Midwest; it has installed about 1,000 megawatts of solar capacity in the Valley. That&#39;s far less solar power, Amanda Garcia pointed out, than deployed by utilities in the Carolinas or Georgia. Though she acknowledged TVA&#39;s plans to expand solar over the coming decade, “actions speak louder than words,” she said.<br><br> But TVA is actually making a big effort these days, Gil Hough, the executive director of TenneSEIA, the state solar-industry association, told me. Hough worked for SACE from 2000 to 2010, promoting solar with Smith. Now he helps deliver it to TVA.<br><br> In the mid-2010s, he told me, the agency did indeed walk away from solar because it was focused on paying down its nuclear debt. Under Lyash, though, TVA has changed, Hough said. It may have only 1,000 megawatts of solar online—but it has more than 2,200 under construction or contracted. “TVA wants every megawatt we can provide them right now,” Hough said. “It&#39;s <i>us</i> who&#39;s holding <i>them</i> back.” Supply-chain disruptions have slowed solar projects and raised prices. But Lyash announced in May that TVA would award contracts this year for 6,000 megawatts of solar power, to be brought online between 2026 and 2029. “We are building as much solar as we can get panels for,” he said.<br><br> What got TVA&#39;s attention was the demand from large corporations, says Reagan Farr, the CEO of the Nashville-based Silicon Ranch, which owns and operates solar farms for TVA and other utilities. Farr told me that companies like Google and Meta, by insisting on renewable energy, convinced TVA that it could no longer fulfill its mission of economic development without expanding its solar capacity. “The power of these large companies—their procurement decisions drive actions,” Farr said.<br><br> Local resistance to solar farms is a growing problem, both TVA and the industry say. At the November TVA board meeting, Chief Operating Officer Don Moul <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/environment/2022/11/10/tva-memphis-coal-ash-to-build-solar-farm/69637542007/">announced a $216 million plan to build a 100-megawatt solar plant on top of the coal-ash pile at the Shawnee power plant</a> , in Kentucky. If it works, Moul said, as much as 1,000 megawatts of solar might one day rise from ash piles around the region—poetic justice, and a way to “alleviate some of the land challenges that we&#39;ve heard about from so many of our stakeholders,” Moul said.<br><br> One of TVA&#39;s key constituencies are the local power companies that distribute its electricity. Their perspective is often very different from that of environmental advocates. At a listening session before a February 2023 board meeting in Muscle Shoals, a dozen of their representatives got up to speak—not about renewables or climate change, but about the blackouts. They were a “black eye for all of us in the Valley,” said Brian Solsbee, the executive director of the Tennessee Municipal Electric Power Association and a former TVA employee. “How does TVA ensure it never happens again?” It needs new generation capacity, Huntsville Utilities&#39; Wes Kelley told me.<br><br> When it was Lyash&#39;s turn to speak, he said what he has said repeatedly: that TVA plans to use all available technologies to decarbonize. He promised a renewed focus on energy efficiency and an aggressive expansion of solar—but also of gas and, in the long run, nuclear. “Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket,” he said. Renewables, in his view, are one basket.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he Tennessee Valley</span> is going through a period of economic expansion that would make Roosevelt proud, and TVA, with its reputation for cheap and reliable power, is partly responsible. The Valley&#39;s new growth includes electric-vehicle, battery, and solar-panel manufacturers—the industries that will drive the electrification of America. When I first met Lyash in Chattanooga, where he had just presented TVA&#39;s Engineer of the Year award, he rattled off some of the names. “Ford, GM, Toyota, Mazda, Volkswagen, LG, SK—those industries are going to decarbonize transportation,” he said. “So we have to provide them the energy <i>now</i> .” Demand is growing already, and Lyash expects it potentially to double by 2050. A study last year by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which mapped how the grid might be decarbonized by 2035, in line with Biden&#39;s goal, assumed that demand might even double by then.<br><br> The decision to build a new gas plant at Cumberland comes in that context as well as that of climate urgency. In TVA&#39;s view, even if it could build enough additional renewables and transmission lines to replace the Cumberland coal unit it plans to retire by 2026, which it says it can&#39;t, solar and wind wouldn&#39;t offer “firm, dispatchable power”—power that&#39;s available regardless of weather or time of day. The basic problem, as the NREL report explains, is “seasonal mismatch”: There&#39;s not enough sunlight to meet peak demand on cold winter mornings and not enough wind on hot summer afternoons; both can be minimal for days.<br><br> Given this reality, is it reasonable to build a new gas plant today, even though it will emit some carbon for years to come? I put the question to Paul Denholm, a senior research fellow at NREL and the lead author of the recent study. “That is a fantastic question, and it&#39;s something everybody is trying to figure out,” he said.<br><br> All visions of a decarbonized grid and of an electrified, net-zero society require huge expansions of wind and solar power. But the NREL study foresees that a net-zero grid will also need some kind of gas to meet peak demand. In three of its four net-zero scenarios, turbines are still burning substantial amounts of natural gas in 2035, and the carbon is being captured rather than released into the atmosphere. In all scenarios, many gas turbines are retrofitted to burn zero-carbon hydrogen.<br><br> TVA&#39;s vision of the future, as Lyash and Aaron Melda explained it to me, aligns broadly with the NREL study. Any gas plants that TVA builds now, they said, will one day either burn “green hydrogen” or involve carbon capture—neither is in wide use yet, and TVA is investing in both. The reason TVA won&#39;t promise a net-zero grid by 2035, Lyash said, is because “it&#39;s going to take deploying technologies that are not currently available at a price people can afford and a scale that can be implemented.” The NREL study assumes that those technologies will be developed in time to reach net zero by 2035; TVA doesn&#39;t want to count on that.<br><br> It&#39;s no surprise, Denholm said, that utilities are struggling to figure out how to cut the last 10 to 20 percent of their carbon emissions. NREL researchers haven&#39;t figured it out either. “The fact that you have conservative utilities saying they know how to [cut] 80 percent—that is a really remarkable shift,” he told me. “I think we need to recognize that and applaud it.”<br><br> Another influential report, Princeton&#39;s 2021 “Net-Zero America” study, included a scenario in which <i>only</i> renewable energy was allowed: By 2050, wind turbines were visible from about one-eighth of the area of the Lower 48 states, solar farms covered an area the size of West Virginia, and long-distance transmission lines mushroomed to five times their existing capacity. Even when such facilities share land with other uses—Silicon Ranch, for instance, allows sheep to graze or pollinator gardens to bloom among the solar panels—they are a significant industrial intrusion on the landscape.<br><br> In some regions, people may prefer less of those—and more of the compact central power stations that TVA knows how to build. The NREL and Princeton studies both include net-zero scenarios in which the expansion of renewable facilities and transmission lines is constrained, perhaps by “challenges with siting and land use,” as NREL puts it. Both scenarios rely, as does TVA, on nuclear plants. “I can&#39;t make the numbers work without new nuclear,” Lyash told me.<br><br> Like many nuclear engineers these days, he thinks the future lies in small modular reactors, or SMRs. At a site on the Clinch River, TVA is planning the first of what it hopes will be a fleet of 20 or so identical SMRs, using a relatively conventional design. “Our goal is not just to build a plant, but to build a plant that sets the model for the US industry,” Greg Boerschig, one of the engineers running the TVA effort, told me.<br><br> The way environmentalists focus on TVA&#39;s renewable capacity or lack thereof frustrates Lyash. “The point is,” he said, “what are your carbon emissions, and what&#39;s your price, and what&#39;s your reliability?” Different regions with different starting points—Arizona has a lot of sunshine, Oklahoma has wind, TVA has a legacy of nuclear and hydro—might reach their clean-energy goals in different ways.<br><br> Toward the end of our last conversation, Lyash opened an app on his phone that shows real-time carbon emissions from electricity generation. “One of the countries that gets held up as having deployed huge amounts of solar, and it&#39;s a big percentage of their capacity, is Germany,” he said. “Germany&#39;s carbon emissions right now are 426 grams per unit of electricity. And today, right now, TVA&#39;s is 247 … And our price is less than a third of theirs.”<br><br> That happened to be a bad day for Germany&#39;s numbers and a good one for TVA&#39;s—but long-term data confirm Lyash&#39;s point: Germany gets a far higher percentage of its electricity from renewables than TVA, but emits substantially more carbon per kilowatt-hour. Germany has made different choices. It closed its last nuclear reactor in April.<br><br> E <span class="smallcaps">nvironmentalists are right</span> to be wary of TVA. In the past it has performed badly on a variety of environmental issues. It built an unnecessary dam, the Tellico, that drowned important Cherokee cultural sites and hundreds of farms and notoriously threatened to extinguish a little fish, the snail darter. (The darter has since recovered.) It stepped back from solar and energy-efficiency efforts when it could have led the way. It was slow to reduce air pollution from its coal plants—which are still lethal polluters—and allowed the major coal-ash disaster in Kingston to happen. This May, even as Lyash was promising 6,000 megawatts of new renewable energy, TVA doubled down on its Cumberland decision: It released a draft environmental-impact statement saying that it also wanted to replace the Kingston plant with gas power by the end of 2027. That will lock in higher emissions for longer, environmentalists say.<br><br> Garcia and Smith think TVA lacks public accountability. They point out that it has no independent public-service commission to regulate it, only a board that, like corporate boards, has no staff of its own and thus depends on management. They would like to loosen TVA&#39;s monopoly and free local power companies to buy power elsewhere, bridling the “unicorn” with market discipline.<br><br> But that would risk undermining the very thing that makes the agency such a precious unicorn: the public-power model. TVA has retained political support, at least in its sphere, for an active government role in improving people&#39;s lives. And in a region where environmental causes are hardly unifying, TVA has said, publicly and repeatedly, that it wants to stop emitting carbon as fast as it can. How it does that should be debated—but in many conversations with TVA and its critics, I never heard a solid reason to doubt its good faith.<br><br> As I traveled the Tennessee Valley, I visited monuments from TVA&#39;s golden age, including Wilson Dam, in northwestern Alabama, with its lofty, sunlit turbine hall and arches like a Roman aqueduct&#39;s, and Norris Dam, in northeastern Tennessee, which closes off the narrow Clinch River with a tall, sculptural curve. TVA engineers and the people of this region built these marvels “for generations yet unborn,” as Senator George Norris liked to say,  with no notion of how valuable they would become in an age of climate change.<br><br> Now it&#39;s time to build more.<br><br> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article is part of the</i> Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">Planet series supported by the HHMI Department of Science Education.</i></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 16:44:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tennessee-valley-authority-energy-transition-nuclear/674729/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tennessee-valley-authority-energy-transition-nuclear/674729/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[A New Kind of Fascism]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> I&#39;ve resisted using the word until now, but something menacing and novel is taking shape with the possibility of a second Trump term. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/YUXcFiauXpQZv1KuRzhYZNE0DR4=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/trump/original.jpg" alt="特朗普在连任竞选中" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Damon Winter / The New York Times / Redux</figcaption></figure> For some years, a variety of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.salon.com/tv/video/vuli6z">news commentators</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/1/29/22250294/trump-american-fascism-jason-stanley">academics</a> have called Donald Trump a fascist. I was one of those who resisted using that term. I thought it had long been abused by casual, imprecise applications, and as a historian of Nazi Germany, I did not think Trumpism was anywhere close to crossing the threshold of that comparison. I still deny that Trump&#39;s presidency was <i>fascist</i> ; but I&#39;m concerned that if he wins another trip to the White House, he could earn the label.<br><br> Fascism was most fully exemplified by the regimes of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. These regimes combined totalitarian dictatorship, wars of imperial conquest, and outright genocide in the case of Hitler (of Jews, Slavs, Roma) or ethnic mass murder in Mussolini&#39;s case (of Libyans, Ethiopians, Slovenes). Placing Trumpism in the same category seemed to me trivializing and misleading.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/10/25/suffocation-of-democracy/">I argued instead that</a> Trump was more like Hungary&#39;s Viktor Orbán or Turkey&#39;s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan than Hitler or Mussolini, and should be categorized as an “illiberal populist” rather than a fascist. And in one very important respect, Trump differed sharply from the European fascists of the interwar period.<br><br> They were ardent militarists and imperialists. War was the crucible in which the new fascist man was to be forged; territorial expansion was both the means and the end of fascist power and triumph. Trump has shown little ambition to pursue such aims. In his first term, he shamelessly abased himself before Russian President Vladimir Putin, exchanged <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/19/how-trumps-love-letters-with-kim-jong-un-could-cost-him/">“love letters”</a> with North Korea&#39;s Kim Jong Un, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/20/trump-peace-deal-taliban/">signed the Doha Agreement</a> with the Taliban committing the US to withdrawal from Afghanistan, and petulantly sought to downgrade US treaty obligations to NATO and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-shakedowns-are-threatening-two-key-u-s-alliances-in-asia/">South Korean</a> allies that he deemed to be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-hits-germany-and-other-delinquent-nato-countries-for-lack-of-defense-spending">“delinquent”</a> and getting a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/30/trumps-claim-that-the-u-s-pays-the-lions-share-for-nato/">“free ride.”</a><br><br> Trump has continued in the same isolationist vein in recent interviews and speeches. He has railed against “globalists.” He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2023/05/11/trump-tells-cnn-town-hall-i-want-everyone-to-stop-dying-in-ukraine/">has promised</a> to settle the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in 24 hours by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-claims-could-zelensky-putin-225254398.html">cutting off aid</a> to Kyiv if President Volodymyr Zelensky does not reach an immediate settlement with Moscow—that is, capitulate to Putin. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4947134">has disparaged</a> Taiwan as a predator nation that stole microchip manufacturing from the US (That Chinese President Xi Jinping would construe the simultaneous abandonment of Ukraine and dismissal of Taiwan as anything other than a green light to invade the latter seems improbable.)<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/nazi-germany-hitler-democracy-weimar/671605/">Christopher R. Browning: How Hitler&#39;s enablers undid democracy in Germany</a><br><br> No question, Trump inflicted grave damage on our country&#39;s political culture, stoking toxic polarization and reveling in dishonesty. And Trumpism did exhibit distinct elements of the fascist style of politics: the inflammatory rallies; the incessant mongering of fear, grievance, and victimization; the casual endorsement of violence; the pervasive embrace of conspiracy theories; the performative cruelty; the feral instinct for targeting marginalized and vulnerable minorities; and the cult of personality. But the Trump presidency lacked any warlike, expansionist interest, and that made it decisively unlike 20th-century fascism.<br><br> Thankfully, also, Trump himself was too lazy, inexperienced, and unprepared to set about systematically constructing a true dictatorship. The main focus of the Trump presidency was less plans and programs and more the theatrics of satisfying his constant, insatiable need for attention and adulation. Everything—whether <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/07/president-trumps-repeated-claim-greatest-economy-history-our-country/">the state of the economy</a> or the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/donald-trump-shares-chocolate-cake-great-chemistry-china-s-xi-n745931">chocolate cake served</a> to China&#39;s Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago—had to be extolled as “the greatest ever.”<br><br> Until the final weeks of Trump&#39;s term, the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/the-seven-broken-guardrails-of-democracy/484829/">guardrails</a> of American democracy seemed to hold firm. The institutions of the federal government remained relatively intact, and civil servants largely secure and uncorrupted. The United States <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-us-democracy-has-declined-significantly-past-decade-reforms-urgently-needed">experienced</a> democratic backsliding but not democratic collapse.<br><br> In a second term, however, a newly emboldened Trump could well attack democracy itself. The MAGA Republican Party of his making has openly explored ways to transform states where they control all branches of government. States that were once pluralistic democracies with at least some chance of a transfer of power are coming to resemble one-party regimes directed by a minority of the population. ( <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/tennessee-republican-partisanship-one-party-state/674732/">Anne Applebaum&#39;s report</a> from Tennessee is a case history in point.)<br><br> In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis, Trump&#39;s putative rival for the 2024 Republican nomination, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/ron-desantis-2024-florida-authoritarian/673483/">has turned his state</a> into a laboratory for testing how a determined, calculating, uninhibited authoritarian can maximize executive power. In many respects, he has already accomplished at the state level what Trump did not have the discipline and focus to do at the federal level. And DeSantis has created a blueprint for other Republican state leaders to follow.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/americans-have-lost-sight-what-fascism-means/616846/">Shadi Hamid: Americans are losing sight of what <em>fascism</em> means</a><br><br> Just as state Republicans have become more ruthlessly autocratic in their methods, a new Trump presidency would be much more efficiently goal-oriented  at the federal level. A huge transformation of the administrative state <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/us/politics/trump-plans-2025.html">is being deliberately planned</a> . The government agencies and civil service he has decried as the “deep state” would be purged or politicized, and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/donald-trump-rally-waco-2024-campaign/673526/">“retribution”</a> he has promised against his enemies would also be carried out. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/10/nathan-simington-christopher-waller-fcc-federal-reserve-appointments-unitary-executive-authority-444136">“unitary executive”</a> theory long promoted by some Republicans would become the reality of an unabashed authoritarianism.<br><br> The very last months of the Trump presidency foreshadowed what a second term would entail. When formerly loyal vassals such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/politics/william-barr-out-as-attorney-general/index.html">Attorney General William Barr</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/09/mark-esper-fired-defence-pentagon-donald-trump">Defense Secretary Mark Esper</a> demonstrated that they would not cross the line into unconstitutional insurgency, Trump sought sycophants for whom no such line existed. In a new Trump administration, total devotion to the leader would be the sole qualification for appointment.<br><br> Unlike previous fascist leaders with their cult of war, Trump still offers appeasement to dictators abroad, but he now promises something much closer to dictatorship at home. For me, what Trump is offering for his second presidency will meet the threshold, and the label I&#39;d choose to describe it would be “isolationist fascism.” Until now, such a concept would have been an oxymoron, a historical phenomenon without precedent. Trump continues to break every mold.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-second-term-isolationist-fascism/674791/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-second-term-isolationist-fascism/674791/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The American Evangelical Church Is in Crisis.

These young people are committed to their Christian faith, but they feel despair and cynicism about the Church&#39;s future. Almost none of them even call themselves “evangelical” anymore, now that the label is confused with political categories. “Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m crazy,” one pastor said to me just days ago. “Does no one see that the Church is in crisis?”<br><br> Indeed it is. I am a conservative evangelical—previously the head of the public-policy wing of the Southern Baptist Convention. For years I dealt with evangelical backlash, including from some of my closest allies and friends, over my opposition to Donald Trump and my views on issues such as racial justice and Church sexual abuse. I hardly thought of myself as a “dissident.” Instead, I believed I was just what I&#39;d always been: a loyal Southern Baptist evangelical trying to apply what I&#39;d learned from children&#39;s Sunday school onward about basic Christian morality and justice. Still, I felt like an outcast and a heretic. I felt homeless. And two years ago, I left the Southern Baptist world I loved.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/06/evangelical-church-pastors-political-radicalization/629631/">Tim Alberta: How politics poisoned the evangelical Church</a><br><br> I know that other evangelicals struggle with similar feelings. I am hard-pressed to think of one congregation that is not divided—or in an adrenal stance of tension about the imminence of division—over the turmoil of the political moment. This should be a time for revival in our churches. Revival is a concept with a long history in American evangelicalism, rooted in the Bible, that says a people who have grown cold and lifeless can be renewed in their faith. It is a kind of resurrection from the dead.<br><br> Yet the language of revival is now riddled with cynicism, and is associated with some of the worst aspects of American evangelicalism. Entrepreneurial American evangelicalism built a programmatic structure for “revival”—whether in the spring- and fall-meeting schedules of little Bible Belt churches like the one in which I grew up or in massive stadium events traveling across the country like rock concerts. As <i>The Guardian</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/15/the-guardian-view-on-american-christianity-change-and-decay">noted</a> in an editorial after the 2016 presidential election, “In the end, a market-driven religion gives rise to a market-driven approach to truth, and this development ultimately eviscerated conservative Christianity in the US and left it the possession of hypocrites and hucksters.”<br><br> Some evangelical Christians have confused “revival” with a return to a mythical golden age. A generation ago, one evangelical leader said that the goal of the religious right should be 1950s America, just without the sexism and racism. Today, even those qualifications are evaporating. Surveys show that, when compared with other religious groups and the general population, white evangelicals are the most susceptible to white-nationalist tropes such as the “Great Replacement” theory, and their institutions caricature the most basic commitments to racial justice as “critical race theory.” Denominations that are glacially slow to recognize documented sexual-abuse cover-ups are lightning quick to expel congregations they find to be too affirming of women&#39;s leadership.<br><br> However, the confusion of nostalgia with revival is not simply the terrain of MAGA-right evangelicalism. Many mainstream evangelicals assumed that we were all just waiting out a moment of disorder: <i>If we can just get through the 2016 presidential election, the pandemic, the racial-reckoning protests and backlashes, the 2020 presidential election, and the seemingly constant evangelical-leadership sex-and-abuse scandals, we&#39;ll end up safely back in 2015.</i> That&#39;s clearly not happening.<br><br> Crisis shakes up an old order—ripping apart, as the apostle Paul put it, what&#39;s made of “wood, hay, stubble” (1 Corinthians 3:12). Now every moment is a possible apocalypse—in which what&#39;s been around us all the while is revealed—and thus every moment is an hour of decision.<br><br> The idea of revival as a return to some real or imagined moment of greatness is not just illusory but dangerous. In the supposedly idyllic Christian America of the post–World War II era, the evangelical preacher AW Tozer wrote: “It is my considered opinion that under the present circumstances we do not want revival at all. A widespread revival of the kind of Christianity we know today in America might prove to be a moral tragedy from which we would not recover in a hundred years.” Tozer knew that the confusion of revival with nostalgia could amount to exactly what <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2022/august-web-only/body-christ-keeps-score-spiritual-trauma-sbc-church-abuse.html">contemporary psychologists tell us about trauma</a> : <i>What is not repaired is repeated.</i><br><br> <i>Want to hear more from Russell Moore?

Get your pass</i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/live/atlantic-festival-2023/"><i>here</i></a> <i>.</i><br><br> That&#39;s why the crisis before evangelical America is not necessarily bad news. Many people, myself included, lament what we see as the fragmentation of the evangelical movement. People who once led ministries together no longer speak to one another. People who prayed together for decades now say to one another, “I don&#39;t even know who you are anymore!” All of this is in the context of an American culture that also seems to be fragmenting—a process accelerated by the collapse of mediating institutions and the growth of a social-media ecosystem—in ways that the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">compared in this magazine</a> to the destruction of the biblical Tower of Babel.<br><br> And yet, the problem with the Tower of Babel was not fragmentation. The problem was unity. The builders were united by their own hubris in building something that would ultimately destroy them. The confusion of the languages and the scattering of people were the work of God. The answer was not to reassemble the old architectural plans and start again. The answer instead was in the next chapter—with a lone figure, Abram of Ur, who heard a promise and trekked out into the desert, not knowing where he was going.<br><br> The answer to the crisis of credibility facing evangelical America is not fighting a battle for the “soul of evangelicalism,” with one group winning and exiling the losers. John and Charles Wesley did not replace the 18th-century Church of England to create Methodism, but their renewal movement still resonated throughout the world and with other Protestant denominations. Billy Graham was cast out from many of the fundamentalist sectors in which he had learned to preach the Gospel, but he carried the Gospel where his mentors never could.<br><br> The answer is instead what it has always been: Those who wish to hold on to the Old Time Religion must recognize that God is doing something new. The old alliances and coalitions are shaking apart. And the sense of disorientation, disillusionment, and political and religious “homelessness” that many Christians feel is not a problem to be overcome but a key part of the process. The insight of evangelical Christianity, at its best, is that any pilgrimage cannot start with a road map of certainty but must begin with the cry of faith that says, like the noble disciple Thomas wrongly labeled as a doubter, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” (John 14:5).<br><br> Nostalgia—especially of the sort wielded by demagogues and authoritarians—cannot protect religious faith, because it uses religion as a tool for worldly ends, leaving a spiritual void. The Christian Church still needs an organic movement of people reminding the rest of us that there&#39;s hope for personal transformation, for the kind of crisis that leads to grace.<br><br> CS Lewis noted that the one prayer that God almost never grants is “encore.” Lewis wrote that our nostalgia for the “golden moments in the past” can be nourishing and sustaining, as long as we see them for what they are—memories, not blueprints. “Properly bedded down in a past which we do not miserably try to conjure back, they will send up exquisite growths,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cslewisinstitute.org/resources/reflections-september-2016/">Lewis argued</a> . “Leave the bulbs alone, and the new flowers will come up. Grub them up and hope, by fondling and sniffing, to get last year&#39;s blooms, and you will get nothing.”<br><br> If evangelicals deny the depths of the crisis in front of us, and simply opt for the sort of public relations that can preserve the coalitions and power structures of yesteryear, we will lose a generation longing to see whether the Gospel is real or just another means to mobilize voters or market to customers. We will find ourselves in one more contest to see what kind of power we can leverage to make that happen—which, as always, will put us on the side of the crucifiers rather than on the side of the Crucified.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/evangelical-trump-christians-politics/620469/">Peter Wehner: The evangelical Church is breaking apart</a><br><br> Churches must stop the frantic rhetoric and desperate lack of confidence that seek to hold on to the Bible Belt of the past. Instead, those worthy of the word <i>evangelical</i> should nurture the joyous and tranquil fullness of faith that prays for something new, rooted in something very old—namely a commitment to personal faith and to the authority of the Bible.<br><br> That starts not with manifestos and strategic road maps, but with small-scale decisions to reawaken the awe of the God evangelicals proclaim. We must refocus our attention on conversion rather than culture wars and actually read the Bible rather than mine it for passages to win arguments. No individual can change the “evangelical movement” alone. Change comes, first, person by person, then congregation by congregation. If enough of us would embrace this sense of homelessness as our new normal—as where we should have been all along—then we can rekindle a longing for a different Kingdom to call home.<br><br> In a country exhausted by the quest to make America great again, perhaps what we need is to make evangelicalism born again.<br><br> And, in the end, that&#39;s not a strategy. It&#39;s a prayer.<br><br> <small><i>This article has been adapted from Russell Moore&#39;s forthcoming book,</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/losing-our-religion-an-altar-call-for-evangelical-america-russell-moore/9780593541784?affiliate_id=atl-347">Losing Our Religion: An Altar Call for Evangelical America</a> <i>.</i></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-evangelical-church-division-politics/674810/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-evangelical-church-division-politics/674810/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Seven Books for the Lifelong Learner]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> These books may tempt you to take up a new pursuit and enlarge your sense of your own capabilities. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/rKaC0goYzwabGHwRybphGxsgMns=/0x0:8000x4500/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/MakeBook_A_noNumbers/original.jpg" alt="制作一本小书的步骤图" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Ben Denzer for The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> For the past six months, I have been obsessed with housekeeping—something that, all of my former roommates can attest, I have previously shown neither interest in nor aptitude for. I have drawn up cleaning schedules, spent far too much time thinking about the relative merits of different fabrics, and become chipper when loading the dishwasher. I even recently found myself describing it as “fun.”<br><br> I credit and blame one book for all of this: Cheryl Mendelson&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/home-comforts-the-art-and-science-of-keeping-house-cheryl-mendelson/9780743272865?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Home Comforts</em></a> . First published in 1999, this unlikely best seller contains nearly 900 pages of practical advice—the proper way to wash dishes, the use of furniture paste wax. What drew me in was its wonderful opening essay, in which Mendelson, a novelist, professor, and lawyer, argues for the importance and dignity of keeping house—an act “that makes your home alive, that turns it into a small society in its own right, a vital place with its own ways and rhythms.” Although I remain a haphazard housekeeper, I&#39;ve become convinced that housekeeping is both an art and a science, an enterprise whose meaning extends far beyond keeping one&#39;s home clean.<br><br> The seven books below also describe the experience of becoming absorbed by a skill or craft, and deliver insights into what mundane activities—say, playing sports or learning a foreign language—can tell us about how we live today. Look closely enough at any human endeavor, these books suggest, and you&#39;ll find lessons on our relationship to the natural world, to history, to other cultures, and to our own body. And they so vividly capture the satisfactions of the pursuits they describe that you might be tempted to take up gardening or long-distance running or bookbinding and enlarge your sense of your own capabilities.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/in-other-words-jhumpa-lahiri/9781101911464?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>In Other Words</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Jhumpa Lahiri</strong><br><br> In 2012, Lahiri moved to Rome and stopped reading and writing in English in order to immerse herself in Italian. This bilingual series of reflections—the original Italian on the left, an English translation by Ann Goldstein on the right—charts her love affair with the Romance language, from her “indiscreet, absurd longing” upon first hearing it on a trip to Florence to the 20 years of language classes, tutoring, and diligent self-teaching that followed. The march toward fluency, she admits, is “a continuous trial.” She mixes up similar words such as <em>schiacciare</em> (“crush”) and <em>scacciare</em> (“expel”), uses the wrong prepositions, and can&#39;t quite get the hang of when to use simple or imperfect past tense. When she begins composing stories in Italian, she&#39;s aware that she will never attain the facility she has in English. But Italian reintroduces mystery, delight, and intensity to her reading: “Every page seems to have a light covering of mist,” she writes. “The obstacles stimulate me. Every new construction seems a marvel. Every unknown word a jewel.” Beneath her sense of wonder is a deeper argument—that plunging into new skills for the love of them is fundamentally hopeful, even transcendent. “The more I feel imperfect,” she writes, “the more I feel alive.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/the-terrible-downside-of-ai-language-translation/674687/">Read: Learn a foreign language before it&#39;s too late</a><br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/beyond-a-boundary-c-l-r-james/9780822355632?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Beyond a Boundary</em></strong></a> <strong>, by CLR James</strong><br><br> James, the Trinidadian scholar, might best be known for his Marxist writings and his advocacy for Caribbean independence. Less known is his obsession with cricket. James spent a lifetime steeped in the sport: He disappointed his family by focusing on the game rather than schoolwork, played for a first-class club on Trinidad, and eventually covered cricket as a journalist in England. He even credits the sport for his activism. “Cricket,” he writes, “had plunged me into politics long before I was aware of it”—in part because class and race tensions on the island played out among its socially stratified clubs. <em>Beyond a Boundary</em> makes the case that cricket is impossible to understand without considering its historical, social, and cultural context; in the book&#39;s most ambitious moments, it argues for cricket&#39;s foundational place in modern British history and for its status as a dramatic and visual art. Even if you know nothing about the sport, James conveys its richness—how a batter&#39;s style can reflect both individual personality and a society&#39;s priorities, and how the game effortlessly connects its followers with the wider world.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/onward-and-upward-in-the-garden-katherine-s-white/9781590178508?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Onward and Upward in the Garden</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Katharine S. White</strong><br><br> White describes her gardening habits as “careless,” “lazy,” and “amateur,” but the critical eye and exacting taste that come through in her collected gardening columns for <em>The New Yorker</em> are a delight. White was that magazine&#39;s first fiction editor—she was an early publisher of many famous writers, including EB White, her future husband—and in these columns she delivers crisp assessments of gardening books and seed catalogs from 1958 to 1970, considering not only their prose but ease of use, typography, paper quality, and color reproduction. Scattered throughout are glimpses of a life suffused with flowers. In winter, she moves through a house crowded with plants, worrying about the location of the cyclamens and the temperature of the African violets. Once, she informs us, she tried to grow lilies in her frozen Maine garden, which resulted in “the comic spectacle of me and my eager family attacking a flower border with a crowbar.” Her opinions about bearded irises and gourds, dahlias and gladioli are all expressed with such humor and charisma that I couldn&#39;t help dreaming of what a garden of my own might look like.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2020/09/teaching-healing-power-garden-class/616198/">Read: The healing power of garden class</a><br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-shepherd-s-life-modern-dispatches-from-an-ancient-landscape-james-rebanks/9781250060266?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>The Shepherd&#39;s Life</em></strong></a> <strong>, by James Rebanks</strong><br><br> Cast your mind&#39;s eye over the verdant mountains of England&#39;s Lake District, and you might think of Wordsworth and the Romantic poets writing paeans to wildernesses untouched by man. Rebanks, a shepherd whose family has lived on that land for centuries, rebuts these poetic images of his home. “Every acre of it,” he writes in his thought-provoking memoir, “has been defined by the actions of men and women over the past ten thousand years.” The author makes the care and maintenance of sheep utterly absorbing, conjuring the coordinated pincer movement the shepherds perform every summer to gather their sheep from the mountaintops and the nerve-racking work of birthing lambs in the spring, which sometimes requires reaching in with one&#39;s bare hands. By the end, selecting which rams to mate with your ewes begins to seem like a high-stakes artistic decision. Rebanks positions his portrait of traditional farming as a counterpoint to modern life (he finds a stint at Oxford largely “pointless and empty”). His compelling critique invites readers to seek out more rooted, time-honored ways to live.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-running-a-memoir-haruki-murakami/9780307389831?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Haruki Murakami</strong><br><br> This classic avocational memoir follows Murakami as he trains for the 2005 New York City Marathon and reflects on a life of serious running. The book verges on self-help—chapter titles include “Suffering Is Optional” and “Most of What I Know About Writing Fiction I Learned by Running Every Day”—but the aura of upbeat resignation that colors the proceedings alters its tone. “Life is basically unfair,” Murakami writes. “But even in a situation that&#39;s unfair, I think it&#39;s possible to seek out a kind of fairness.” You simply can&#39;t control what happens on race day, just as Murakami can&#39;t control his aging body and slower finishing times, much less the stubborn, avoidant personality he&#39;s carried around “like an old suitcase.” This book is refreshingly free of exhortations for everyone to take up running. (The author in fact believes forcing people to do it is “pointless torture,” which, yes.) But the scenes of him jogging through Kauai or Cambridge, Massachusetts, thinking of nothing but crisp morning air and “the sounds of my footsteps, my breathing and heartbeats, all blended together in a unique polyrhythm,” are their own kind of persuasion.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-2189-mile-marathon/559112/">Read:</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-2189-mile-marathon/559112/">The wisdom of running a 2,189-mile marathon</a><br><br> <strong><em>A Degree of Mastery</em></strong> <strong>, by Annie Tremmel Wilcox</strong><br><br> The first section of <em>A Degree of Mastery</em> flings the reader straight into the deep end of book conservation, and it is utterly engrossing. Wilcox slices the spine off of a deteriorating book printed in 1817, disassembles the binding, and then literally washes the pages in a bath of deionized water. She meticulously mends rips with a Japanese wheat-starch paste, prepared in a device called a Cook &#39;n&#39; Stir. I learned names for parts of books I didn&#39;t know had names: That striped cord attached to the spine of hardcover books, for instance, is an endband. In 1987, Wilcox became the first female apprentice of the renowned book conservator William Anthony, before his death from liver cancer. Her memoir details life at a workbench in the University of Iowa Libraries&#39; conservation department, where she picks up bookbinding by doctoring 15th-century incunabula and editions of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> under Anthony&#39;s patient eye. It&#39;s also a moving meditation on the nature of apprenticeship, on the mutual learning that occurs among a craft&#39;s practitioners, and on the teachers who live on through students who espouse their knowledge and ideals.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-curse-of-the-boyfriend-sweater-essays-on-crafting-alanna-okun/9781250095633?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>The Curse of the Boyfriend Sweater</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Alanna Okun</strong><br><br> Most people, Okun asserts, become engrossed in hobbies because they&#39;re seeking a specific kind of satisfaction: “that small but constant motion that helps them metabolize the universe and comprises a corner of their identity.” Some play musical instruments; some fish. Okun&#39;s preferred activity is knitting, a lifelong pursuit, as well as crochet and embroidery, all of which create <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/04/crafts-coronavirus-quarantine-stress-relief/609187/">safe havens for her from an often-overwhelming world</a> . In these strikingly vulnerable essays, knitting baby cardigans and crocheting gargantuan blankets aren&#39;t just pleasant diversions but emotional lifelines while Okun contends with her grief over the death of two friends and her grandparents, as well as the agonies of romance and her struggles with anxiety. “A craft project,” Okun writes, “allows you to hold something concrete in your hands even while everything around you is swirling and illegible.” Crafting is also, she makes clear, extremely fun. Okun brings her knitting on the subway and to the beach, and makes witty lists of the skills she&#39;s gained from her fiber-art endeavors. Through her eyes, we see the infinite potential of “a large pile of marled green wool, three balls of unbleached cotton, a tiny skein of silk.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul

You]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>身份识别公司 Clear 允许旅客付费插队。但你无法通过购买来摆脱美国机场的不便。 <br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic.资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure>真诚地道歉，我需要请您想象一下自己到达机场的情景。刚从任何交通工具带你到那里的时候，你可能至少有点烦恼。也许你迟到了或者你正在和小孩子争吵。也许您会因为塞满东西的手提包和随时可能破裂的滚轮而感到沉重，因为您原则上反对支付 50 美元托运行李。你的身上已经开始散发出焦虑汗臭味。<br><br>一旦您进入机场，等待您的就是许多机场闹剧的中心：TSA 线。你在那里会遇到什么，谁也说不准。您可能会将您的身份证件交给工作人员，然后立即将您的行李放到行李扫描仪的传送带上，否则可能会有数百人在您面前排队。您的笔记本电脑可以与钱包放在同一个垃圾箱中吗？您的开衫是可以继续穿的衬衫，还是需要脱掉的夹克？当你发现时你就会发现，通常是当有人带着徽章对你大喊大叫时。<br><br>旅行可能是生活中的一大乐趣，但在最好的情况下，机场却是拜访亲人或体验新地方的最终回报的必要障碍。在最坏的情况下，用我的同事伊恩·博格斯特的话说，这是一个“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/laguardia-airport-redevelopment-american-infrastructure-lesson/673015/">可怕的炼狱</a>”，充满了漫长的等待、糟糕的食物、意外的费用、狭窄的宿舍、自发的时间表变化，以及许多人表现得像绝对不合群的怪胎。所有这些混乱都受到严格的监视和监管，一旦你进入机场，几乎所有发生的事情都不受你的控制。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/05/psychological-reason-people-are-late-airport/590500/">阅读：机场人员有两种类型</a><br><br>但如果你能夺回部分控制权呢？这就是 Clear 背后的承诺，过去几年你在飞行时可能会遇到过其员工：他们穿着整齐的格子衬衫，面带微笑，站在一排光滑的白色控制台前。他们比大多数 TSA 工作人员更友好，而且他们可以为您提供优惠：交出您的身份证件，让他们扫描您的眼球，今天无需支付任何费用，他们就会把您带到队伍的前面。即使你自己从未上过圈，你也可能见过 Clear 员工从你已经在排队的队伍后面挑选出一些迟到的旅客。也许你甚至在轮到你通过检查站时就被插到了你的前面，这违反了公民社会的一条基本规则，以至于普通学龄前儿童都知道：插队是错误的，等待时间最长的人应该排在后面。<br><br>清晰是一种奇怪的现象。它在某些方面与 TSA PreCheck 类似，并且与 TSA PreCheck 一起运作，后者是联邦政府自己的付费通关服务，可以更有效地通过机场安检运送旅客。但与 PreCheck 不同的是，它是一家独立的私营公司，与 Hudson News 和 Dunkin&#39; 一起融入了机场令人迷惑的经济。 Clear 的核心是一家生物识别数据公司，乘坐飞机的惨淡经历帮助它完成了很少有生物识别初创公司能够做到的事情：说服数百万热切的消费者交出他们的个人信息和年费。许多初创公司都渴望将你的食指或眼球变成身份证或信用卡等，但 Clear 可能是最接近让科技行业梦想成为现实的一家。<br><br>清晰也是另外一回事。这项服务之所以存在，是因为美国航空旅行是一个不必要的惩罚过程，而航行安全是其最严重的瓶颈之一。事实证明，机场的巨大而棘手的麻烦是私营部门服务的沃土，这些服务旨在使登机过程稍微更容易忍受。随着出行率的飙升，机场已经在很大程度上受到私营部门为高消费者提供的福利的影响，只会变得更加充满优质服务和精英便利设施。当一切都是福利时，公共利益还剩下什么？<br><br>与当代美国航空旅行的许多事情一样，Clear 在机场的出现也是 9/11 事件的间接结果。其前身 Verified Identity Pass（简称 VIP）是在袭击事件发生后成立的，当时联邦政府正在寻找能够为商务旅客等经常乘坐飞机且被认为安全风险较低的人加快安全程序的公司。 VIP 的标志性产品（令人困惑地<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.epic.org/privacy/airtravel/clear/">也被称为 Clear</a> ）在该公司 2009 年申请破产之前吸引了大约 20 万客户。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onezero.medium.com/clear-conquered-u-s-airports-now-it-wants-to-own-your-entire-digital-identity-15d61076e44d">根据记者戴夫·格什戈恩 (Dave Gershgorn) 2020 年在 Clear 上发表的一篇报道</a>，当时该产品被两位前对冲基金经理收购，他们的愿景是超越政府承包新服务的生活。<br><br> VIP 更名为 Clear，该公司之前向其会员发行快速通行卡，现在转向生物识别技术。为了注册 Clear 的招牌产品 Clear Plus，该公司会扫描您的虹膜和指纹，验证您的身份，并在最初的免费月份之后向在机场注册的人收取每年 189 美元的费用。按照这个价格，您可以被护送到该公司目前运营的 52 个北美机场的安检线前面。如果您同时拥有 Clear 和 TSA PreCheck，该服务会将您排在 PreCheck 队伍的前面，这样您也可以脱鞋。<br><br>对于没有 Clear Plus 的人来说，推销和插队可能会非常烦人。 Clear 的论点是，其服务有助于让所有旅客的安全工作更加顺利。公司发言人安娜贝尔·沃尔什 (Annabel Walsh) 在一封电子邮件中将 Clear 描述为机场效率的“力量倍增器”：通过 Clear 进行验证的旅客无需让 TSA 检查其身份证件，这使得工作人员可以腾出时间来检查其他人。沃尔什告诉我，机场还允许 Clear 销售人员承担双重职责，为旅客回答问题。这似乎对公司和机场都有好处：低工资和艰苦的工作使吸引和留住机场员工成为一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/airports-have-always-had-trouble-attracting-workers-expect-longer-lines-n1272540">持续的斗争</a>，因此理论上，Clear 销售人员可以填补一些客户服务的空白，同时也能找到推销产品的可靠机会。当有人注册时，机场会从他们的订阅费中扣除一部分，根据格什戈恩的调查，每年这笔费用总计可达数百万美元。 （沃尔什在被问及时没有确认这一数额。）<br><br>沃尔什告诉我，Clear 的计划目前拥有 1600 万会员。并非所有人都为 Clear Plus 的免排队便利性付费：该公司提供免费程序，其中一个程序允许您在某些机场预约通过安检的时间，另一个程序则提供进入某些体育场馆和竞技场的快速通道，任何人都可以在下载免费应用程序并上传自拍照后使用。与此同时，Clear Plus 的许多会员也纷纷加入，因为该计划已成为精英级消费者忠诚度计划的一个共同特征。达美航空和美联航均投资了 Clear，将为常旅客支付全部或部分 Clear Plus 费用，而美国运通白金卡持卡人则可获得单独会员资格的全额账单积分。尽管沃尔什坚决反对 Clear 可以被视为一种<em>福利</em>而不是<em>重要的安全基础设施</em>的想法，但它确实是一种非常受欢迎的福利。<br><br>正如 Clear 进军体育场馆和竞技场所表明的那样，该公司最大的野心不仅仅局限于航空旅行。 Clear 希望将其验证技术扩展到现代生活中需要等待和摸索识别的其他领域。尤其是，该公司对医疗保健行业有设计。在疫情爆发初期，Clear 开发了一项免费服务来验证会员的疫苗接种状况和最近的检测结果，沃尔什告诉我，未来 Clear 验证可以用于解锁患者的医疗记录、保险卡和自付额等事情；该公司目前正在与迈阿密健康大学合作开发这样的系统。 Clear 或类似的公司有一天可能会成为您个人身份的一站式商店，成为您与政府、您的医生、您的专业许可等之间的中间人。无需从钱包中取出保险卡或将手机敲击读卡器来使用 Apple Pay，所有这些都将包含在您的指纹中。<br><br>对于任何一家设法使所有这一切成为广泛采用的现实的公司来说，都会获得巨大的好处——不仅在服务本身的承包和销售会员资格方面，而且还可能在收集的数据宝库方面。您的旅行习惯、病史、活动出席和购买的详细信息，全部编译成具有经过验证的身份的单个用户个人资料，可能值很多钱。 Clear 坚称，未经个人用户许可，公司不会也不会向第三方出售或提供任何用户数据。即便如此，正如格什戈恩指出的那样，许多通过广告获得大量收入的大型科技公司在技术上也不会向第三方出售用户数据。例如，Facebook 通过广告定位向符合广告商所需人口统计标准的消费者群体出售访问权。<br><br>沃尔什告诉我，Clear 使用会员数据的唯一目的是为其会员提供服务，并且它不会通过促销定位来将其数据货币化。然而，管理 Clear 服务的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.clearme.com/privacy-policy">隐私政策</a>至少看起来是允许的。该政策规定，Clear 可以使用除生物识别和健康数据之外的所有数据来进行营销和消费者研究，联系会员了解其营销合作伙伴的产品和服务，并“向我们的消费者提供我们认为他们可能感兴趣的产品或服务。”沃尔什为这项政策辩护，称它“让 Clear 能够让我们的会员随时了解新的 Clear 服务，并帮助我们优先考虑为我们的会员构建哪些新服务。”<br><br>当你艰难地走向大门时，无论 Clear 的员工对你微笑多么灿烂，你都很容易对 Clear 感到有点害怕。反对数据收集的论点有很多，但主要的一个非常简单：公司对你的了解越多，他们就越容易在你脆弱的时刻操纵你或从你的钱中分走你的钱。如果您曾经在简单的谷歌搜索后被有关婚礼供应商或婴儿产品的广告淹没，这可能意味着您刚刚订婚或怀孕，那么您就会知道这些看不见的力量可以轻松地辨别您生活中最私密的细节。对这些做法的警惕是许多生物识别公司很难找到热心客户的一个重要原因。如果价值主张是能够用指纹支付来换取所有个人数据，那么您可能会正确地认为在读卡器上敲击信用卡或手机并不难。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/airport-bars-drinking-morning/674322/">阅读：某处现在是凌晨 5 点</a><br><br>也就是说，美国的商业生活一再表明，人们往往乐于为了适当的便利而放弃各种个人信息。 Clear 已经聚集了数百万会员，这一事实相当令人信服地证明，通过美国机场的安检就是<em>这么严峻</em>；人们已经准备好跳过队伍了，指纹见鬼去吧。在这方面，Clear 与消费者忠诚度计划的密切联系尤其有意义。忠诚度计划是让公众接受个人数据收集的最流行的方式之一：您同意使用唯一标识符（例如常旅客号码）跟踪您的行为，然后您可以获得折扣、便利或特殊福利。许多人可能甚至没有意识到他们正在做的讨价还价，但许多其他人似乎对此完全满意。如果您可以在杂货账单上节省一点，谁会在乎克罗格是否可以更轻松地跟踪您购买的商品呢？<br><br>换句话说，怀疑对于克利尔来说可能不是一个真正的问题。相反，他们最大的障碍实际上可能恰恰相反：急于寻求任何试图利用机场系统的服务。通过在美国航空旅行的混乱中寻找优势，Clear 进入了一场军备竞赛，无论对于它自己还是其他任何人来说，这场竞赛都可能无法获胜。该公司业务的性质意味着它必须始终领先机场人群一步。如果这群人迎头赶上，Clear 将被其基础设施的缺陷所淹没——这种现象只会有助于产生更多新的私营部门服务，从而让那些乘坐飞机最多的人的情况减轻一些。<br><br>航空业专家、旅行网站 View From the Wing 的创始人加里·莱夫 (Gary Leff) 告诉我，多年来，航空公司观察人士一直要求美国运输安全管理局 (TSA) 做出简单的改变，他们认为这些改变可以在不影响安全的情况下加快安检过程——结束对随身携带液体的战争，允许使用小剪刀，让人们不脱鞋，将笔记本电脑放在包里。这些变化将解决最有可能发生的瓶颈：不是在 Clear Plus 为其会员免除的身份检查点，而是在紧随其后的部分，在那里您和您的所有物品都会得到一次视觉检查。它们也是免费的，并使所有旅客受益。 TSA <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2011/09/07/140240633/for-now-shoes-still-come-off-at-airport-security">坚称</a>，现有程序对于安全<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fodors.com/news/news/will-the-u-s-change-its-3-1-1-liquid-rule-on-flights">至关重要</a>。此类变化往往会变成政治足球，因此很难采取任何可能被视为过于宽容的措施。莱夫表示，要做出那些能够给你在机场的体验带来最大改变的改变就更困难了——也就是说，为人手严重不足的联邦航空管理局和美国老化机场的资本改善提供更多资金。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/laguardia-airport-redevelopment-american-infrastructure-lesson/673015/">阅读：美国建造了一个非常好的机场</a><br><br>因此，偶尔乘坐飞机的人会遇到不可预知的安检线，而经常出行的旅客则会利用航空公司和信用卡的优惠来套利。 TSA PreCheck 的受欢迎程度显而易见，五年会员费为 78 美元：根据旅游网站<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/tsa-precheck-more-members/"><em>The Points Guy 的数据，</em></a>到 2022 年初，国土安全部可信旅行者计划的会员人数（其中大多数是 PreCheck 用户）比疫情爆发前增加了 44%，达到近 3000 万人。这种受欢迎程度也是一个致命弱点。该计划的成员可能拥有自己的生产线，但它与其他所有生产线一样，都面临着人员不足和基础设施老化的问题，而且使用该计划的人越多，PreCheck 生产线就越像常规生产线。<br><br>关于福利的问题在于人们会追求它们。为经常飞行的人提供服务会导致服务变得拥挤，因为这些人一直在机场。随着 Clear 的发展，它遇到了一些与 PreCheck 相同的问题。也就是说，您可能会发现自己再次需要等待，这次是为了扫描您的虹膜或指尖。莱夫告诉我，他是 Clear 的长期会员，而且非常满意。他说，由于疫情最严重后旅行量再次增加，他有时只是拿出身份证，然后去预检队列，因为看起来这比等待 Clear 办理登机手续要快。 （沃尔什告诉我，Clear 会员平均等待时间不到五分钟。）<br><br>像运输安全管理局这样的基础设施瓶颈无法通过私营部门服务来解决，因为你真正所做的只是暂时超越人群。最终，即使有像 Clear 这样昂贵的服务，太多的人也会赶上，而其背后的问题仍然无法得到解决。 “能够使用它的人越多，你面临的排队时间就越长，”莱夫说。 “在某种程度上，这可能只是暂时的缓刑。”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 20:55:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>帕特里克·普勒尔/图片联盟/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>我活了三十多年，从来没有被蜱虫咬过。事实上，这可能是一个谎言，我无法确定。因为尽管蜱虫有鱼叉状的口器，尽管某些种类的蜱虫可以吸吮<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355616/">长达两周的时间</a>，尽管有些蜱虫吸食的血液足以使体重膨胀 100 倍，但它们的叮咬却谨慎得令人不安。德克萨斯农工大学蜱虫研究员阿德拉·奥利瓦·查韦斯 (Adela Oliva Chavez) 表示，“小时候，我身上有数百只蜱虫”，其中至少有几只会咬人。然而她永远不会注意到，直到她姨妈把它们从她的皮肤上摘下来。<br><br>蜱虫隐形背后的秘密是蜱虫的<em>唾液</em>——一种奇怪的、滑溜的、多面的液体，没有生物同类<em>。</em>它可以让害虫的叮咬处保持奇特的瘙痒和疼痛，并让它们不受宿主免疫力的影响而不受阻碍地进食。随着气候变化重塑世界，唾液也帮助蜱虫进入新的栖息地和宿主，并带来许多致命的病毒、细菌和寄生虫。<br><br>尽管蜱虫非常依赖血液，但它们几乎从不吃东西。在它们有时长达数年的生命周期中，它们在每个阶段可能只进食一次：幼虫、若虫和成虫。这意味着， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/the-marvels-of-tick-saliva/594652/">正如我的同事莎拉·张曾经写道的那样，每顿饭都必须非常重要。</a>与蚊子和其他吸血昆虫可以轻易逃脱的不同，蜱虫必须在肉上停留数天甚至数周——这是一场漫长的盛宴，需要它们像临时肢体一样移植到宿主的身体上。<br><br>在整个过程中，唾液是关键。当蜱虫第一次叮咬时，它的唾液会在伤口上涂上一种胶状物质，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30459085/">将其嘴固定在适当的位置</a>。一旦安全，蜱虫就会部署<a data-event-element="inline link"

表示：“蜱虫的唾液就像一辆豪华车辆，将它们运送到感染部位并铺上红地毯。”研究表明，多种病原体在唾液的推动下会 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10118219/">增强</a><a data-event-element="inline link"

orchestrating a concerted march north into Canada. At the same time, the <em>percentage</em> of ticks carrying infections is also increasing, Thangamani told me, and for decades now, case counts of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis in several parts of the world have been on a steady rise. As cold seasons shrink, the periods of the year when ticks bite—usually, the warmest months—are expanding too. “Many, many places are getting filled up with ticks,” says Jean Tsao, an entomologist at Michigan State University. “And they&#39;re going to get more.”<br><br> It helps that many ticks aren&#39;t picky about whom they carry or bite. Some species, as they push into new places, have picked up new pathogens in the past few years—Bourbon virus, heartland virus—that pose additional threats to us. Many tick species are also relatively indiscriminate about their hosts: Within its lifetime, a single deer tick may “feed very happily on reptiles, avians, and birds,” says Pat Nuttall, a virologist and tick researcher at the University of Oxford. Their spit is intricate enough that it can be tailored to counteract the defenses of each species in turn. Transfer a tick from a rabbit to a human or a dog, Oliva Chavez told me, and it will take notice—and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00517/full">adjust its saliva</a> , quite literally to taste.<br><br> Vaccines to combat Lyme and other tick-borne diseases have long been in development. But many researchers think the more efficient tactic is going after the tick itself—a strategy that could, at best, “stop the transmission of several pathogens at once,” says Girish Neelakanta, a tick biologist at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. Anti-tick immunity is possible: Studies have documented <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34074602/">guinea pigs, cattle, rabbits, goats, and dogs</a> developing sustained defenses against the arachnids after they&#39;ve been bitten over and over again—even reactions that can help the animals detect a bite immediately, and sweep the pest away.<br><br> But spit is a slippery target for bodily defenses to hit. The substance doesn&#39;t just shut down immune responses. It also reformulates itself constantly so that it can keep evading the host&#39;s defenses—as often as every few hours, faster than most of the immune system can keep track. By the time the body has prepped an assault on one salivary ingredient, the tick has almost certainly swapped it out for the next. “It&#39;s a game that the tick is playing, a catch-me-if-you-can kind of thing,” says Sukanya Narasimhan, a tick researcher at Yale. To outcompete the tick&#39;s tricks, Narasimhan thinks it will be key to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/sukanya-narasimhan/?tab=research">develop a vaccine</a> that triggers the body to respond to tick bites <em>fast</em> , “as soon as a tick attaches,” she said, ideally by targeting the saliva&#39;s first ingredients.<br><br> As ticks continue their takeover, it&#39;s hard not to develop at least some grudging respect for their pluck. Some scientists even think that studying, or perhaps <em>mimicking</em> , their saliva could lead to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00812/full">other breakthroughs</a> . Copycatting the spit&#39;s immunosuppressive tendencies could be useful for the treatment of asthma, or for drugs that assist in organ transplants; imitating its anticoagulant properties could help keep life-threatening clots at bay. Some tick-saliva ingredients have even prompted investigations into their potential as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018305468?via%3Dihub">cancer</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13318-018-0500-z">therapy</a> . Ticks, after all, have been studying mammalian bodies for millions of years, all in hopes of subterfuge; under their tutelage, Chou, the Arcadia Science CEO, hopes to learn more about the molecular pathways that drive the urge to itch.<br><br><br> Ticks aren&#39;t invincible, though, and some of the same global changes now easing their entry into new habitats could eventually hinder their progress. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6262408/climate-change-lyme-disease-ticks/">Already</a> , they are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/58/4/1536/5942051">fleeing parts of the planet</a> that have grown too hot, too humid, too flooded, too razed with wildfires for them or their preferred hosts to survive, including certain inhospitable <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168723">pockets of the American South</a> . A tick decline could be good for us. But it would also be a symptom of a planetary scourge that has grown worse. Ticks, undoubtedly, “will continue to adapt,” Thangamani told me. And yet they, too, have their limits—further, but not that much further, beyond our own.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 14:36:37 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tick-bite-saliva-infection-spread/674804/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tick-bite-saliva-infection-spread/674804/</item></channel></rss>
