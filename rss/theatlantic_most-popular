href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/israel-protests-judicial-system-overhaul-netanyahu/673530/">前所未有的强烈抗议</a>迫使以色列政府暂停对该国司法机构的改革。但缓刑只是暂时的。当时，极右翼部长<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/27/netanyahu-israeli-judicial-overhaul-suspend-protests">Itamar Ben-Gvir</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hes-delaying-overhaul-to-allow-dialogue-but-vows-reform-will-happen/">Bezalel Smotrich</a>向支持者保证，改革将在 7 月下旬通过。<br><br>但这并没有发生。相反，周一，在以色列议会夏季会议的最后一周，执政联盟通过了其拟议立法中最不重要的部分：限制最高法院在审查政府决定时使用“合理性标准”的能力。与极右翼的承诺相反，政府没有制定将最高法院法官的任命从属于政界人士的计划。它也没有赋予联盟推翻司法裁决的能力。<br><br>换句话说，以色列的民主虽然存在缺陷，但目前仍然完好无损。该国最高法院非但没有丧失行为能力，反而已经在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-justices-rush-back-from-abroad-to-hear-petitions-against-reasonableness/">紧急</a>召开一场史无前例的会议，对本周限制其权力的努力的合法性做出裁决。但无论以色列在未来几个月是否会侵蚀其民主护栏，其人民都已经失去了同样重要的东西：基本的社会信任。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/israel-protests-netanyahu-judicial-systems-overhaul/673623/">亚伊尔·罗森伯格：对以色列剧变的三大误解</a><br><br>以色列的交战阵营表面上正在争夺合理性原则，这是一种从英国普通法继承而来的技术工具，允许该国高等法院推翻某些政府决定，但不能推翻立法。但从根本上来说，这场辩论与法律本身无关，很少有以色列人能够轻易解释这一点。这是关于谁的判断值得信赖来维护国家的民主。<br><br>简而言之，合理性原则是一种<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-reason-for-reasonableness-a-doctrine-at-the-heart-of-the-overhaul-explained/">主观标准</a>，允许以色列法官在评估某些政府行为和公务员任命的优点时，以自己的考虑代替立法机关的考虑。鉴于以色列最高法院的成员是由一个主要由其他法官和律师组成的小组任命的，因此存在限制这种缺乏民主问责制的能力的可信案例。<br><br>但本周的改革并不是在真空中进行的。它是在以色列历史上最极右翼政府夺取权力的背景下发生的——该政府在上次选举中只获得了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://votes25.bechirot.gov.il/">48.4%</a>的选票。如果以色列的法官不再有权决定哪些行政决定是“合理的”，那就意味着当权的政治家可以决定哪些行政决定是“合理的”，即使他们也缺乏授权。如今，这些政客包括<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://twitter.com/AnshelPfeffer/status/1683912208307085321">显示</a>，三分之二的以色列公民反对执政联盟单方面改革司法机构。换句话说，大多数以色列人根本不相信自己政府的意图。他们不相信内塔尼亚胡，更不用说<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/12/israel-election-bibi-netanyahu-ben-gvir/672572/">他所依赖的极端主义盟友</a>来维持自己的权力，会比未经选举产生的最高法院更合理。他们不相信联盟会在已经宣布打算解构整个大厦的情况下停止对司法机构的这一小规模攻击。以色列反对派已经对其同胞失去了为整个国家最佳利益行事的信心，这就是为什么其领导人现在 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/GLZRadio/status/1683697314509082625">公开指责</a>政府试图摧毁民主。<br><br>这种积怨远远超出了通常的党派政治，而且是双向的。内塔尼亚胡的极右翼部长们并没有试图平息事态并重建公民信任，而是在反对派面前抹黑了他们最近的胜利，并承诺采取更多同样的措施。 “沙拉吧开门了，”本-格维尔在周六晚上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-752065">欢呼道</a>，他将即将到来的合理性改革描述为只是更加令人生畏的自助餐的开胃菜。一位更精明、更负责任的政治家会说一些陈词滥调，说<i>这对以色列来说是一个困难时期，但我们都是爱国者，都希望彼此和国家都过得最好。</i>本-格维尔并不相信这一点，而且很少觉得有必要假装他相信这一点。相反，他和他的盟友<a

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>天使工作室</figcaption></figure>我和其他一百万女性一样，这个周末真正想看的电影是<i>《芭比娃娃》</i> 。一场友谊的庆典！少女时代！颜色是粉红色的！但我的编辑有不同的想法：我会去看那部关于儿童性交易的电影吗？网上很多人愤怒的那个？<br><br> “呃，当然，”我回答道。我是一个团队合作者。<br><br>周日，当我到达弗吉尼亚州麦克莱恩的泰森斯角 AMC 时，大厅里挤满了穿着紫红色紧身连衣裙、戴着金色假发和长筒靴的人。然而，这些快乐的电影观众中没有一个人与我朝着同一个方向前进。相反，我的剧院里有几十个表情忧郁的人，他们选择观看周日下午 15 美元的放映，放映年度最令人不安的电影之一。<br><br> <i>《自由之声》</i>于 7 月 4 日上映，讲述了一位名叫蒂姆·巴拉德 (Tim Ballard) 的男子辞去国土安全部工作，亲自从哥伦比亚性贩运团伙中营救两名洪都拉斯儿童的故事。正如我的同事凯特琳·蒂芙尼 (Kaitlyn Tiffany) 在 2021 年<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/children-sex-trafficking-conspiracy-epidemic/620845/">所写的</a>那样，巴拉德是一个真实存在的人，拥有“极端的二头肌、极端的蓝眼睛和极端的漂白金发”。他确实成立了一个组织，进行诱捕行动，以将人们从人口贩子手中解救出来。但根据<i>Vice</i>的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7a3qw/a-famed-anti-sex-trafficking-group-has-a-problem-with-the-truth">一项新闻调查</a>，他的非营利组织地下铁路行动夸大了其一些国际救援的细节及其在国内执法中的作用。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/children-sex-trafficking-conspiracy-epidemic/620845/">阅读：（假）儿童性交易大流行</a><br><br><i>《自由之声》</i>早在发行之前就引起了争议。该片于2018年初杀青，被福克斯收购，随后迪士尼收购福克斯后立即搁置了该片。立刻，这给了这部电影一种禁忌的、颠覆性的感觉<i> </i>上诉。最终，发行权被卖给了天使工作室，这是一家位于犹他州的公司，制作了基督教历史剧<i>《选民》</i> 。自从<i>《自由之声》</i>开始在影院上映以来，一些观众<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/07/20/false-claim-amc-shut-off-ac-for-sound-of-freedom-fact-check/70431071007/">声称存在旨在阻止他们观看这部电影的破坏事件</a>。本周， <i>《自由之声》的</i>收入突破了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/23/sound-of-freedom-qanon-movie-conspiracy-theories">1 亿美元</a>。上周，前总统唐纳德·特朗普在新泽西州的高尔夫俱乐部举行了一场放映活动，他借用帕丽斯·希尔顿的话说，这部电影是“世界上最热门的电影”。周二晚上，众议院议长凯文·麦卡锡为国会议员放映了这部电影。<br><br>这部电影的批评者认为，这部电影夸大了儿童剥削的普遍性，从而有助于推进<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">匿名者Q的阴谋论</a>，即撒旦统治精英猥亵儿童并以他们的鲜血为食。但电影的粉丝说，<i>这是民主党精英不想让你看的电影！</i><br><br> <i>《自由之声》</i>两者都不是。还好——不算太好，但也不算太糟糕。它没有提及“深层政府”的吸血或国会性阴谋。这是一部简单但乏味的动作片，讲述了一个男人追求正义的故事——角色发展为零，有太多的人哭泣或抽雪茄的特写镜头。<br><br>尽管这部电影没有描绘任何特别生动的内容，但虐待儿童的主题仍然很难在大银幕上戏剧化地观看。这令人心烦意乱。但后来与其他观众谈论这件事时也是如此，他们中的许多人似乎相信他们的一些同胞纵容贩卖儿童。换句话说， <i>《自由之声》</i>只是一场看似无休无止的文化战争的最新导火索，这场文化战争鼓励美国人相信彼此最坏的一面。<br><br>在电影中，巴拉德由吉姆·卡维泽饰演，他也在 2004 年的<i>《耶稣受难记</i>》中饰演耶稣，他自己也涉足了<i>Q</i>的黑暗奇思妙想。2021 年，他在俄克拉荷马州的一次右翼会议上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/07/sound-of-freedom-qanon-theories-jim-caviezel/">发表讲话</a>，他在会上警告与会者“儿童的肾上腺素红”，这是一个荒谬的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-qanon-became-obsessed-with-adrenochrome-an-imaginary-drug-hollywood-is-harvesting-from-kids">理论</a>，称全球精英正在使用从被绑架的儿童身上提取的化学物质来让他们看起来精神抖擞。电影中的某一时刻，当被问到为什么他如此坚定地要拯救孩子们时，卡维泽的角色停了下来，他的眼睛里充满了泪水。 “上帝的孩子是不卖的，”他说。我的剧院爆发出掌声和“阿门！”的呼喊声。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">摘自2020年6月号：Q的预言</a><br><br>这部电影团结了宗教保守派和特朗普的支持者，以及一小部分长期偏执的人——或者至少在我的放映中似乎是这样。 （我选择这个特定的剧院是因为，当我在网上查看时，很多人都买了票——可能是因为麦克莱恩比华盛顿特区的许多其他地方拥有更多的右倾选民。）<br><br>凯特·考克斯 (Kate Cox) 是一位来自麦克莱恩 (McLean) 的退休人员，戴着小花朵耳环，她在电影开始前告诉我，她是“反堕胎天主教徒”，担心边境问题。 “这正是这件事的意义所在，”她说。 “他们正在把这些人卖为性奴隶。”考克斯和她的女朋友们还担心从墨西哥运来的芬太尼：<i>建一堵墙有多难？</i><br><br> “还有无家可归的人！”考克斯的朋友佩吉拒绝透露自己的姓氏，她补充道。 “城市正在分崩离析。”考克斯点点头。 “不管你对特朗普有什么看法，99%都是真的，”她说，“但这在特朗普统治下并没有发生。”<br><br>与拥有巨额营销预算和企业合作伙伴关系的<i>芭比娃娃</i>不同，口碑似乎是<i>自由之声的</i>主要上座驱动力：周日与我交谈的大多数人都是在亲人的推荐下购买了门票。<br><br> “我的一个朋友告诉我看这部电影，”居住在华盛顿的瑞士人妮可·古铁雷斯 (Nicole Gutierrez) 告诉我。 “这是一个比我们想象的更大的业务。好莱坞、政客——他们都参与其中。”她拿出手机给我看她朋友几分钟前发的一条短信。 “也许你知道这意味着什么。”她的朋友发送了字母<i>C</i> ，然后是眼睛表情符号，最后是字母<i>A</i> 。 “我认为他指的是中央情报局，”我说。古铁雷斯扬起了眉毛。 “每个人都参与其中，”她说。 “当然是白宫。”<br><br>在片尾字幕后的奖励片段中，卡维泽用小声鼓励观众扫描二维码，为买不起票的人买票。 “我们可以让<i>《自由之声》</i>成为 21 世纪奴隶制的<i>汤姆叔叔的小屋</i>，”他说，并将这部电影比作激发 19 世纪废奴运动的小说。之后，当灯光亮起时，我这一排一位自称切斯卡的女士站起来，宣布她来这里是为了谈论她失踪一年半的 23 岁女儿。 “我期待奇迹的出现，”她说。 “她很快就会回来。”切斯卡警告我们末日即将来临，并要求我们为她和彼此祈祷。有几个人再次说：“阿门”，至少有一个女人拥抱了她。<br><br>当我离开剧院时，我走近另一群朋友，听听他们的想法。他们都拒绝透露自己的姓氏，但很高兴告诉我他们发现这部电影有多么强大。 “男人想要保护别人，”一位名叫乔治的黑发中年男子说道，“所以有人会对孩子做出这样的事情，这真是令人尴尬。”他提出了杰森·阿尔丁的新歌《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-streams-up-controversy-1235543896/">在小镇尝试</a>》，乡村艺术家在歌曲中承诺为治安维持正义。 “我喜欢那首没人愿意谈论的歌曲，”乔治说。真正的男人会殴打虐待儿童的人。<br><br> “你意识到你正在和该地区少数几个保守派人士交谈吗？”乔治的大胡子朋友史蒂文眨了眨眼睛问我。 “你知道让我惊讶的是，”他继续说道，“这就是左派讨厌这部电影的原因。我不明白。”他看着我，好像在等待答案。<br><br>如果左翼人士对这部电影感到排斥，那么右翼人士也出于同样的原因觉得有必要看这部电影。我们的政治领导人、我们的社交圈和我们选择的媒体已经在我们的回声室中准确地表明了我们应该如何看待它——除此之外，还有很多其他的事情。 <a data-event-element="inline

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>玛丽亚·梅德姆</figcaption></figure>亚历克西斯·米斯科 (Alexis Misko) 的健康状况已经有了很大改善，每月一次，她可以离开家几个小时。首先，她需要在黑暗的房间里躺上两天的大部分时间来增强能量，除了听有声读物之外什么也做不了。然后她需要一个司机、一个可以让她躺下的安静目的地，以及随后几天的休息时间来恢复。她告诉我，短暂的户外快乐“永远都感觉不够”，但这比她在长期感染新冠病毒的第一年所承受的要多得多，当时她无法坐直超过一个小时或站立超过 10 分钟。现在，至少，她可以在洗澡的同一天看电视。<br><br>前世，她在研究生院熬夜，在医院担任职业治疗师，辛苦轮班。她进行长距离跑步，并在长途飞行后下垂。这一切都无法与她自三年前感染 COVID-19 以来所经历的一切相比。她在一封电子邮件中告诉我，她现在感受到的疲劳“就像你的本质和你的生命力完全耗尽”。<br><br>疲劳是新冠肺炎长期症状中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext#seccesectitle0027">最</a><a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9383197/">严重的</a>症状之一，也是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://batemanhornecenter.org/education/me-cfs/">肌痛性脑脊髓炎</a>（也称为慢性疲劳综合症或 ME/CFS）等类似慢性疾病的特征。但在这些疾病中，疲劳与日常疲倦截然不同，以至于与我交谈过的大多数人都没有预料到疲劳的严重性、多方面性和持久性。<br><br>首先，这种疲劳并不是一个单一的症状；而是一种症状。它<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852700/">有很多面孔</a>。它会让身体变得沉重：丽莎·盖斯勒将其比作“在一个重力极高的星球上穿着铅外骨骼，同时患有严重的关节炎”。它可以使身体加速：许多疲劳的人感到“疲惫不堪”，尽管已经完全精疲力竭，但矛盾的是，他们处于“战斗或逃跑”模式。它可能是认知性的：思想变得迟缓、语无伦次，有时甚至令人痛苦——就像“我的额叶里卡着钢丝绒”，ME 的文学历史学家格温·杜雅尔丁 (Gwynn Dujardin) 告诉我。<br><br>米斯科说，疲劳将最平凡的任务变成了“痛苦的成本效益分析”。如果您洗衣服，您需要休息多长时间才能做饭？如果你喝了水，你能去厕所吗？只有四分之一的长途运输者出现<a data-event-element="inline link"

ME/CFS 带来的疲劳。 “我醒来时感到很疲惫，”长期感染新冠病毒的莱蒂西亚·苏亚雷斯告诉我。<br><br>由于长期患有新冠肺炎、ME/CFS 和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chronicillnessinclusion.org.uk/2021/04/28/what-are-energy-impairment-and-elci/">其他限制能量的慢性疾病</a>，仅在美国就有数百万人经历着令人衰弱的疲劳。但美国社会倾向于将无所作为等同于不道德，将生产力等同于价值。面对一种根本不允许人们活动的情况——即使是一种可以测量和解释的缺陷——许多医生和亲人默认不相信。当苏亚雷斯告诉别人她的病时，他们通常会说：“哦，是的，我也累了。”当她卧床数天时，人们告诉她，“我需要这样的周末。”苏亚雷斯的问题是非常现实的，尽管研究人员已经开始弄清楚为什么这么多像她这样的人正在遭受痛苦，但他们还不知道如何阻止它。<br><br>疲劳会产生一种残疾的背景嗡嗡声，但它可能会被更严重的撞击事件所打断，这些事件甚至会剥夺长途运输者通常拥有的少量能量。<br><br>达莉亚·奥勒 (Daria Oller) 是一名物理治疗师和运动教练，因此当她在 2020 年 3 月感染新冠病毒时，她很自然地尝试通过锻炼来改善健康。她不明白为什么在短短的跑步之后，她的疲劳、脑雾、胸痛和其他症状就会急剧加剧，以至于她几乎无法动弹或说话。这些事故与她在训练中学到的一切相矛盾。在与 ME/CFS 的物理治疗师交谈后，她才意识到这种现象有一个名字：<em>劳累后不适</em>。<br><br><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Post-exertional_malaise">劳累后不适</a>(PEM) 是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(21)00513-9/fulltext#secsectitle0030">ME/CFS 的典型特征</a>，也是长期新冠肺炎 (COVID-19) 的共同特征。它通常被描述为一种极端形式的疲劳，但更正确的理解是，它是一种生理状态，在这种状态下，<em>所有</em>现有症状都会更加剧烈地燃烧，并且会引发新的症状。除了疲劳之外，患有 PEM 的人还可能会感到剧烈的放射痛、炎症烧灼感或胃肠道和认知问题：“你会感到中毒、流感样、脑震荡，”米斯科说。疲劳通常在劳累后立即出现，而 PEM 可能会在数小时或数天后出现，而且严重程度不成比例。即使是轻微的体力或脑力劳动也可能会让人们疲惫数天、数周、数月。看医生可能会导致车祸，填写残疾福利申请或感知明亮的灯光和响亮的声音、在炎热的天气里调节体温或应对压力也可能会导致事故。如果您在疲劳时感觉电池电量耗尽，那么在 PEM 中它们就会完全消失。这是可能性的毁灭：大多数人只能在噩梦中经历无法动弹的绝望，杜雅尔丹告诉我。 “PEM 就是这样，但更痛苦。”<br><br>医疗专业人员在培训期间通常不会了解 PEM。许多人怀疑它的存在，因为它与健康人所忍受的任何东西都非常不同。玛丽·迪莫克告诉我，只有当她看到患有 ME/CFS 的儿子马修在她眼前崩溃时，她才明白这意味着什么。 “他简直<em>融化了</em>，”迪莫克说。但大多数人从来没有看到过这样的损害，因为 PEM 将那些处于其中的人隐藏起来，不让公众看到。而且由于它通常会在延迟后发生，经历过 PEM 的人可能会在朋友和同事眼中表现良好，而他们随后不会看到他们后来付出的高昂代价。<br><br>这个价格既真实又可衡量。在心肺运动测试（CPET）中，患者使用跑步机或健身自行车，而医生则记录他们的耗氧量、血压和心率。伊萨卡学院的运动生理学家贝特西·凯勒告诉我，如果一天后重新测试，大多数人都可以重复他们的表现，即使他们患有心脏病或因缺乏活动而身体状况不佳。获得 PEM 的人不能。<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4004422/">第二次的结果是如此不同，以至于</a>当凯勒在 2003 年第一次对某人进行 ME/CFS 测试时，“我告诉我的同事，我们的设备没有校准，”她说。但她和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor203170">其他人</a>在数百名 ME/CFS 和长期感染新冠病毒的患者身上发现了同样的模式——“无法用任何心理学解释的客观结果，”布莱根妇女医院的肺科医生 David Systrom 告诉我。 “许多患者被告知这一切都在他们的脑海中，但这确实掩盖了这一点。”尽管如此，许多保险公司拒绝支付第二次检查的费用，而且许多患者无法在不严重危及健康的情况下进行两次（甚至一次）CPET。 “20 年后，我仍然有医生反驳和忽视客观数据，”凯勒说。 （一些长期的新冠肺炎研究<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M22-1492">完全忽略了 PEM</a> ，或者将其与疲劳捆绑在一起。）<br><br>奥勒认为，这种忽视的出现是因为 PEM 颠覆了运动有益的教条——对于大多数其他疾病来说，这句格言是正确的。 “改变你整个职业生涯所做的事情并不容易，即使我告诉某人他们可能会伤害病人，”她说。事实上，许多长途运输者的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/9/5093">情况变得更糟</a>，因为他们在生病的最初几周<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0264331">没有得到足够的休息</a>，或者试图按照医生的指示进行锻炼来缓解症状。<br><br> PEM 患者也经常被误诊。他们被告知，由于久坐不动，他们的身体状况不佳，而他们的不活动是频繁发生车祸的结果，而不是原因。他们被告知，当他们通常拼命想要移动但要么身体无法移动，要么使用约束来避免撞车时，他们会感到沮丧和没有动力。奥勒是一个由 1,500 名患有长期新冠肺炎的耐力运动员组成的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidsupportforenduranceathletes/">支持小组</a>的一员，他们非常习惯在疼痛和疲劳中跑步、游泳和骑自行车。 “为什么我们都要<em>停下来</em>？”她问。<br><br>一些患有能量限制性疾病的患者认为，他们的疾病名称和症状使他们更容易被抹黑。<em>疲劳</em>会促使人们尽量减少日常疲劳等严重消耗。<em>慢性疲劳综合症</em>将广泛的致残状况分解为容易被忽视的单一症状。这些抱怨是有道理的，但问题比任何名字都更深刻。<br><br>杜雅尔丁（Dujardin）这位英国教授正在（非常缓慢地）撰写一部疲劳文化史，他认为我们对疲劳的概念已经被几个世纪的还原论所削弱。随着医学研究慢慢分裂成解剖学专业，它失去了对人体能量贡献系统的总体认识，或者说它的缺失。能量的概念曾经是（现在仍然是）万物有灵论哲学的核心，虽然也曾经是西方世界的核心，但现在它在文化上与庸医和伪科学联系在一起。杜雅尔丁说：“美国的每个收银机上都有小瓶‘能量增强剂’。”但当美国国立卫生研究院 (NIH) 于 2021 年召开<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/about/events/beyond-symptom-biology-fatigue">疲劳生物学</a>会议时，“专家们不断观察到，疲劳没有标准定义，每个人都对人类能量有不同的看法。”这些术语已经变得如此不具体，毫无帮助，以至于我们的“疲劳”概念可以涵盖多种状态，包括 PEM 和闲置，并且可能受到社会力量的严重影响，尤其是利用他人能量的愿望。<br><br>正如历史学家艾米丽·K·阿贝尔 (Emily K. Abel) 在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/sick-and-tired-an-intimate-history-of-fatigue-emily-k-abel/9781469663340?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《生病和疲倦：疲劳的亲密历史》一书中</em></a>指出的那样，20 世纪之交的许多关于日常疲劳的研究都集中在体力劳动者的疲倦上，并致力于找到提高这些工人生产力的方法。在此期间，疲劳从雇主必须解决的生理极限转变为个人必须克服的心理失败。 “当今社会对那些不<em>坚持到底</em>的人进行污蔑；<em>坚持下去</em>；<em>表现出勇气</em>，”杜雅尔丁说，而由于颠覆这些规范的罪过，长途运输者“不仅不被相信，而且受到公开的蔑视。”倡导组织 MEAction 的科学和医疗外展主任 Jaime Seltzer 告诉我，疲劳是“彻底反资本主义的”。<br><br>能量限制性疾病对女性的影响也不成比例，长期以来，女性一直被认为是懒惰的人。杜雅尔丹指出，在西方史诗中，喀耳刻和狄多等女性因用休息的诱惑避开奥德修斯和埃涅阿斯等探险英雄而受到严厉的对待。后来，工业化的开始使女性成为居家闲散的象征，而男性却在公共场合劳作。当逃避工作成为一种道德失败时，它也仍然是一种女性的失败。<br><br>这些态度在连续两任美国总统处理新冠疫情的方式中显而易见。唐纳德·特朗普总是表现出男性力量的讽刺，并斥责竞争对手“精力不足”， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/10/trump-strength-coronavirus/616682/">他将自己从冠状病毒中康复描述为一种统治行为</a>。乔·拜登没有那么夸夸其谈，但他仍然明显<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1553451657748512768">向公众保证</a>，他正在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-tests-positive-covid-will-continue-work-white-house-2022-07-21/">努力应对新冠病毒感染</a>，而他的政府则优先考虑让人们<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-health-emergency-management-federal-emergency-management-agency-20f1e637f03f400376e7381df5ccdb51">重返工作岗位的</a>政策。两人都没有提到可能会导致疲劳或需要休息。<br><br>医学也吸收了社会对疲劳的耻辱，甚至在选择那些加入医学行列的人时也是如此。其众所周知的艰苦训练计划将大多数患有能量限制性疾病的人排除在外，同时重视严重耗尽时的运作能力。这一点，再加上对<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/women-pain-gender-bias-doctors/">女性疼痛进行心理分析的</a>倾向，有助于解释为什么如此多的长途运输者<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/health-care-workers-long-covid-are-being-dismissed/620801/">——甚至是那些拥有医学资格的人</a>，如米斯科和奥勒——受到他们寻求护理的专业人士的如此恶劣的对待。她告诉我，当杜雅尔丁第一次因 ME/CFS 症状寻求医疗帮助时，这位十年来一直对她很好的医生突然变得僵硬和多疑，将她所有的详细描述简化为“疲劳”，然后离开了房间，没有提供诊断或治疗。<em>永不停息​​的</em>文化压力如此之大，以至于许多人无法接受他们的患者或同龄人可能被迫这样做。<br><br>没有一个大统一的理论可以解释有关长期新冠肺炎和 ME/CFS 的一切，但这些疾病<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2">也不是</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(21)00513-9/fulltext#secsectitle0030">完全的谜团</a>。事实上，有大量证据表明至少有两种途径可以解释为什么患有这些疾病的人的能量如此有限。<br><br>首先，大多数患有能量限制性慢性病的人的自主神经系统都存在问题，该系统控制着心跳、呼吸、睡眠、激素释放和其他我们无意识控制的身体功能。当<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9639503/">这个系统</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/100/8/519/1521818">被破坏</a>时——一种称为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=34">自主神经失调</a>”的情况——肾上腺素等激素可能会在不适当的时刻释放，导致紧张但疲倦的感觉。人们可能会突然感到困倦，就好像他们正在关闭一样。血管可能不会在需要的时候扩张， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2021/11/19/heart-failure-muscles-long-covid-chronic-fatigue/">从而剥夺活跃的肌肉和器官的氧气和燃料</a>；这些器官可能包括大脑，导致认知功能障碍，例如<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/long-covid-brain-fog-symptom-executive-function/671393/">脑雾</a>。<br><br>其次，许多长期患有新冠肺炎和 ME/CFS 的人在产生能量方面存在问题。当病毒侵入人体时，免疫系统会反击，引发炎症状态。感染和炎症都会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36355108/">损害</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32327453/">线粒体</a>——为细胞提供能量的豆形电池。线粒体功能障碍会产生<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8403932/">称为“活性氧”（ROS）的剧烈化学物质</a>，从而造成更多的细胞损伤。炎症<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ij.hapres.com/htmls/IJ_1341_Detail.html">还会引发新陈代谢转向</a>快速但低效的能量产生方式，耗尽细胞的燃料并充满乳酸。约翰·霍普金斯大学的药理学家和神经科学家宾杜·保罗告诉我，这些变化共同解释了普遍存在的疲劳感，因为“身体难以产生能量”。他们还可以解释患者在细胞充满乳酸和活性氧时所经历的灼热、中毒的感觉。<br><br>这两条途径——自主神经和代谢——也可能是 PEM 的原因。正常情况下，自主神经系统会平稳地调至一种激烈的战斗和逃跑模式，然后调至一种较平静的休息和消化模式。但“在自主神经功能障碍中，旋钮就变成了一个开关，”西奈山的神经科学家和康复专家大卫·普特里诺告诉我。 “你从坐着到站着，你的身体会想：<em>哦，我们要去打猎吗</em>？你停下来，你的身体就会停止运转。” The exhaustion of these dramatic, unstable flip-flops is made worse by the ongoing metabolic maelstrom. Damaged mitochondria, destructive ROS, inefficient metabolism, and chronic inflammation all compound one another in a vicious cycle that, if it becomes sufficiently intense, could manifest as a PEM crash. “No one is absolutely certain about what causes PEM,” Seltzer told me, but it makes sense that “you have this big metabolic shift and your nervous system can&#39;t get back on an even keel.” And if people push through, deepening the metabolic demands on a body that already can&#39;t meet them, the cycle can spin even faster, “leading to progressive disability,” Putrino said.<br><br> Other factors might also be at play. Compared with healthy people, those with long COVID and ME/CFS have differences in the size, structure, or function of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00051-2/fulltext">brain</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032274/">regions</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2018/12/12/death-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-me-cfs-autopsy-files/">including</a> the thalamus, which relays motor signals and regulates consciousness, and the basal ganglia, which controls movement and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21386#:~:text=Hence%2C%20dysfunctions%20of%20the%20basal,thalamic%E2%80%93frontal%20cortical%20system8.">has been implicated in fatigue</a> . Long-haulers also have problems with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8938726/">blood vessels</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34087216/">red blood cells</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02286-7">clotting</a> , all of which might further staunch their flows of blood, oxygen, and nutrients. “I&#39;ve tested so many of these people over the years, and we see over and over again that when the systems start to fail, they all fail in the same way,” Keller said. Together, these woes explain why long COVID and ME/CFS have such bewilderingly varied symptoms. That diversity fuels disbelief— <em>how</em> <em>could one disease cause all of this</em> ?—but it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect if things as fundamental as metabolism go awry.<br><br> Long-haulers might not know the biochemical specifics of their symptoms, but they are uncannily good at capturing those underpinnings through metaphor. People experiencing autonomic blood-flow problems might complain about feeling “drained,” and that&#39;s literally happening: In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30">POTS</a> , a form of dysautonomia, blood pools in the lower body when people stand. People experiencing metabolic problems often use dead-battery analogies, and indeed their cellular batteries—the mitochondria—are being damaged: “It really feels like something is going wrong at the cellular level,” Oller told me. Attentive doctors can find important clues about the basis of their patients&#39; illness hiding amid descriptions that are often billed as “exaggerated or melodramatic,” Dujardin said.<br><br> Some COVID long-haulers do recover. But several studies have found that, so far, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4505315">most don&#39;t</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29513-z">fully return</a> to their previous baseline, and many who become severely ill stay that way. This pool of persistently sick people is now mired in the same neglect that has long plagued those who suffer from illnesses such as ME/CFS. Research into such conditions are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32568148/">grossly underfunded</a> , so no cures exist. Very few doctors in the US <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/mecfs-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-doctors-long-covid/671518/">know how to treat these conditions</a> , and many are nearing retirement, so patients struggle to find care. Long-COVID clinics exist but vary in quality: Some know nothing about other energy-limiting illnesses, and still prescribe potentially harmful and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/25/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-cdc/">officially discouraged treatments</a> such as exercise. Clinicians who better understand these illnesses know that caution is crucial. When Putrino works with long-haulers to recondition their autonomic nervous system, he always starts as gently as possible to avoid triggering PEM. Such work “isn&#39;t easy and isn&#39;t fast,” he said, and it usually means stabilizing people instead of curing them.<br><br> Stability can be life-changing, especially when it involves changes that patients can keep up at home. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432282/">Over-the-counter supplements</a> such as coenzyme Q10, which is used by mitochondria to generate energy and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20010505/">is depleted in ME/CFS patients</a> , can <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25386668/">reduce fatigue</a> . Anti-inflammatory medications such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Low_dose_naltrexone">low-dose naltrexone</a> may have some promise. Sleep hygiene may not cure fatigue, but certainly makes it less debilitating. Dietary changes can help, but the right ones might be counterintuitive: High-fiber foods take more energy to digest, and some long-haulers get PEM episodes after eating meals that <em>seem</em> healthy. And the most important part of this portfolio is “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Pacing#The_principles_of_pacing">pacing</a> ”—a strategy for carefully keeping your activity levels beneath the threshold that causes debilitating crashes.<br><br> Pacing is more challenging than it sounds. Practitioners can&#39;t rely on fixed routines; instead, they must learn to gauge their fluctuating energy levels in real time, while becoming acutely aware of their PEM triggers. Some turn to wearable technology such as heart-rate monitors, and more than 30,000 are testing a patient-designed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.makevisible.com/blog/why-we-are-building-visible">app called Visible</a> to help spot patterns in their illness. Such data are useful, but the difference between rest and PEM might be just 10 or 20 extra heartbeats a minute—a narrow crevice into which long-haulers must squeeze their life. Doing so can be frustrating, because pacing isn&#39;t a recovery tactic; it&#39;s mostly a way of not getting worse, which makes its value harder to appreciate. Its physical benefits come at mental costs: Walks, workouts, socializing, and “all the things I&#39;d do for mental health before were huge energy sinks,” Vogel told me. And without financial stability or social support, many long-haulers must work, parent, and care for themselves even knowing that they&#39;ll suffer later. “It&#39;s impossible not to overdo it, because life is life,” Vogel said.<br><br> “Our society is not set up for pacing,” Oller added. Long-haulers must resist the enormous cultural pressure to prove their worth by pushing as hard as they can. They must tolerate being chastised for trying to avert a crash, and being disbelieved if they fail. “One of the most insulting things people can say is &#39;Fight your illness,&#39;” Misko said. That would be much easier for her. “It takes so much self-control and strength to do less, to be less, to shrink your life down to one or two small things from which you try to extract joy in order to survive.” For her and many others, rest has become both a medical necessity and a radical act of defiance—one that, in itself, is exhausting.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/chronic-fatigue-long-covid-symptoms/674834/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/chronic-fatigue-long-covid-symptoms/674834/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Have Your Most Fulfilling Vacation Ever]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Turning your leisure into learning offers the happiest holiday experience of all. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/bcQIe3ApyXDk9VlAjnYVwowq3RA=/0x0:3000x1688/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/HowToBuildALife147/original.jpg" alt="一个人一边骑冲浪板一边读书的插图。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Jan Buchczik</figcaption></figure> <i data-stringify-type="italic">Want to stay current with Arthur&#39;s writing? <a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/how-to-build-a-life/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/how-to-build-a-life/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up</a> to get an email every time a new column comes out.</i><br><br> L <span class="smallcaps">ooking for a</span> good vacation this year? You might choose from a number of models. For example, Instagram Adventure, in which you pick an exotic destination, pack as much as you can into every day, take a million pictures, and document everything on social media to advertise that you are as energetic in leisure as you are at work. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Couch Potato, which means that you fritter away the entire two weeks doing very little. Other popular options include Two Endless Weeks in My Childhood Bedroom (for 20-somethings) and A Whole Month&#39;s Pay Shot at Disney Because the Kids Whined All Year (for 30-somethings).<br><br> One great vacation model, which harks back to the ancients, is frequently overlooked. The word for “leisure” in Greek is σχολή, or <i>skhole</i> . In Latin, the word is <i>schola</i> —from which we get “school.” In other words, the name for the place where we teach and learn derives from the word for “leisure.” One way to interpret this is that education is a recreational activity (a concept that may strike my hardworking students as counterintuitive). But a better explanation comes from the 20th-century philosopher Josef Pieper, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Leisure.html?id=VKbcnmvM7N8C&amp;source=kp_book_description">believed</a> that leisure is the circumstance in which we can learn the most, if we understand and use it properly.<br><br> If the conventional vacation models are leaving you cold, Pieper&#39;s insight could provide the holiday you&#39;ve been looking for. This year, consider using your time off as an opportunity to learn something wonderful.<br><br> P <span class="smallcaps">eople pursue</span> different objectives in their vacations, but no one I have ever met was seeking <i>lower</i> levels of positive emotion. The point is to be happier than usual, which is why a bad vacation is so frustrating—it feels like a missed opportunity to reset and make some emotional progress.<br><br> To get the most contentment from your vacation, it is worthwhile to start with an understanding of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00781/full#:~:text=Robert%20Plutchik%20proposed%20eight%20primary,them%20in%20a%20color%20wheel.">basic</a> human emotions. The negative side includes anger, sadness, fear, and disgust, which alert us to threats and stimulate behaviors such as fight or flight to keep us safe. These are obviously not the emotions you are hoping to experience on vacation—though all bets are off if a long car ride with the kids is involved.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/07/pre-vacation-time-off-work-pressure/670939/">Read: Why must we work so hard before vacation?</a><br><br> An abundance of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122271/">basic positive emotions</a> such as joy, surprise, and anticipation are what you seek. But you shouldn&#39;t neglect another positive emotion of special importance: interest—the feeling of curiosity or fascination that captures your attention.<br><br> The experience of interest is favored by evolution: It comes from learning new things, which rewarded our ancestors with more food and a greater chance at survival and reproduction. The same tendency for your Pleistocene hominin forebear to feel satisfaction after devising a novel way to catch a small animal persists in us today when we first master riding a bike or succeed in making a presentable soufflé.<br><br> The well-being effect from learning is not as straightforward as it is for other activities, such as eating a doughnut. In fact, it involves a bit of sacrifice. As scholars <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-009-9166-1">found</a> in 2011, investing in an activity to raise competency can lower your moment-to-moment happiness but can boost well-being measured over a longer time frame of hours and days. This makes perfect sense, of course: You rack your brain <i>learning</i> calculus but then bask in <i>knowing</i> it. In that respect, learning is like exercise: sometimes painful in the moment but rewarding overall.<br><br> A key to maximizing satisfaction through learning is intrinsic motivation, or what the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (who famously wrote about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cgu.edu/people/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/">“flow states”</a> ) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9094-9_7">called</a> “autotelic learning”: learning for its own sake. Neuroscientists in 2014 used fMRI technology to show that this type of learning has to do with the brain&#39;s response to curiosity. They <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(14)00804-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627314008046%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">demonstrated</a> high levels of activity in the midbrain and a structure known as the nucleus accumbens, which indicated an enhanced release of dopamine, when study participants were highly curious about a subject. In other words, satisfying your curiosity through learning about whatever you&#39;re most interested in will give you a neurochemical payoff.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C. Brooks?

You might be tempted to extrapolate from this evidence to predict, for example, that if everybody went to college, we would have a happier society. Not so fast: One 2017 study <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-017-9504-0">suggests</a> that whether higher education drives happiness up or down depends on, among other things, where you live. In nations without high levels of education, many of which are considered developing countries, university education is associated with higher happiness. In countries with labor markets saturated with educated individuals, which is characteristic of greater economic development, the effect is reversed—university attendance is associated with lower happiness. One possible explanation is that for the former group, university training offers a path out of poverty, but for the latter group much of this effect has long since been depleted. Alternatively, something about the rich-world college experience may contribute to lower well-being. Suffice to say that the sort of leisure learning the Greeks had in mind is not identical with the modern American college experience.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">aken together</span> , the research points to a clear strategy to build a great vacation: Identify something you are very interested in for its own sake and focus on it intensively. And because the task or skill should be challenging enough to increase competence, the satisfaction goal should be understood in hours and days, not in the moment to moment of learning.<br><br> You can choose a range of ways to achieve this outcome, whether cheap and casual or expensive and formal. At one end of the scale, you can simply program your own reading curriculum. Over two weeks, you might set about carefully reading four books on a particular topic. Or you might decide to read the entire Bible or Quran. You might also mix your media: reading a biography of JS Bach, for instance, while listening to 50 of his cantatas.<br><br> At a more formal level, you might dedicate your vacation to taking a class. Perhaps you want to learn how to cook Punjabi cuisine, or follow one of the many “massive open online classes” (MOOCs, for short) that are available for free, such as—random example—one about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.edx.org/course/managing-happiness">exploring the science of happiness</a> . For a more intensive (and expensive) option, you might hire a teacher to give you a head start on playing the guitar or speaking Mandarin, and do that for several hours every day. Or hire a nutrition-and-fitness coach. You will be amazed at how much progress you can make in two weeks.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/04/covid-workcation-remote-work-life-balance/629605/">Read: &#39;Workcations&#39; aren&#39;t an escape. They&#39;re practice.</a><br><br> At the most rigorous level, you might go all in and spend your vacation on a guided silent retreat in one spiritual tradition or another. Or perhaps you could make a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/09/happiness-walking-pilgrimage/620075/">pilgrimage</a> , walking in contemplation without devices or interruptions, and immersing yourself during rest periods in a wisdom literature that complements the experience.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">na famous passage</span> of <i>The Republic</i> , Plato <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D7&amp;force=y">advises</a> on how to educate children in a way that will bring out their best: “Do not … keep children to their studies by compulsion but by play. That will … better enable you to discern the natural capacities of each.” In other words, kids will learn better if you allow them to enjoy recreation in a constructive way, rather than forcing them to study, which is more likely to stimulate rebellion.<br><br> A similar principle lies behind the best model of vacation. Feeling compelled to relax and have fun is a common and counterproductive mistake. Telling yourself “I <i>will</i> be refreshed and not think about work!” is bound to lead in the wrong direction. Instead, employ a Platonic strategy and turn your leisure into learning.

First, I read Richard Ford&#39;s <i>The Sportswriter</i> , in which the novel&#39;s protagonist calls his ex-wife “X” as he narrates his version of their shared past (in the next book in the series, he refers to her as Ann). Soon, I spotted X again: In Fleur Jaeggy&#39;s <i>Sweet Days of Discipline</i> , the unnamed teen narrator refers to herself at one point as “Miss X.” And I recently started Catherine Lacey&#39;s <i>Biography of X</i> , in which a widow digs into the hazy past of her late wife, an artist known by the time of her death as “X.” These characters are all shot through with ambiguity; they are people who both invite and resist projection. But they also have nothing to do with one another. Why do they share the same name, or, really, the absence of a name?<br><br> <i>X</i> can be a hard concept to pin down. It can be a meaningful signifier— <i>Wrong answer!</i> —and a generic stand-in. The letter is associated with such varied contexts as Christian symbolism, middle-school-math equations, gender neutrality, pornography, a kiss. <i>X</i> both reinforces absence and electrifies objects with meaning. It is sacred and profane. X is also, as of last weekend, the new name of Twitter.com.<br><br> Elon Musk, less than a year after becoming the owner of Twitter, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-musk-x-rebrand/674818/">changed the site&#39;s name and logo</a> to X. He has started removing bird branding in and around the office. He is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/technology/twitter-x-elon-musk.html">reportedly</a> projecting “X” in Twitter&#39;s cafeteria and renaming conference rooms “eXposure” and “s3Xy.” The rebrand, Musk has said, is a step toward transforming Twitter into an everything app—along the lines of the Chinese app WeChat. Linda Yaccarino, the site&#39;s new chief executive, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213895463215104?s=20">posted</a> on Twitter (on X?) that “X is the future state of unlimited interactivity—centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking.” (Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)<br><br> The letter <i>X</i> is both rich with connotations and ambiguous, which may be part of its appeal for Musk. “When I saw Elon Musk use [ <i>X</i> ], I thought, he&#39;s definitely a semiotician, at least in spirit,” Marcel Danesi, an emeritus professor of semiotics and linguistic anthropology at the University of Toronto, told me. <i>X</i> “reverberates with all kinds of meanings that are intuitive, unconscious, and archetypal,” he said. Jamin Pelkey, a professor at Toronto Metropolitan University and the author of <i>The Semiotics of X</i> , told me that “ <i>X</i> is both an empty signifier and a signifier of everything … You cannot pin it down or say it means <i>this</i> and only <i>this</i> .” History is marked with <i>X</i> ’s, signifying presence and portents: Solitary <i>X</i> marks from more than 10,000 years ago have been found on cave walls in Spain, Pelkey told me. In the Middle Ages, <i>X</i> circulated as a warning symbol, a sign of the cross, and a way for people to seal letters, Danesi said.<br><br> Musk—a member of Generation X—has a long and loaded personal history with the letter. In the 1990s, he co-founded an online bank called X.com. When X.com merged with a company that owned PayPal and Musk became the CEO of the new entity, he reportedly attempted to phase out PayPal branding and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/2023/07/25/elon-musk-paypal-twitter-x-rebrand/">replace it with X</a> . At the time, in the early 2000s, Musk argued that the name was “novel, intriguing, and open-ended,” as Jimmy Soni wrote in his book <i>The Founders</i> . But X.com <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/chafkin/status/1683475959981264900?s=46&amp;t=jVmW_mMn_l8k3nxy6JDtWg">apparently reminded people too much of porn</a> . Soon, Musk was ousted from the company. He has since used <i>X</i> in both his brands and his personal life: He runs the company SpaceX, has created corporate bodies called X Holdings and a start-up called xAI, and named one of his children X Æ A-12.<br><br> If <i>X</i> is Musk&#39;s personal white whale, his interest in the letter also aligns with broader trends in branding. <i>X</i> was especially hip at the dawn of the millennium (think XBox, X Games): “For marketing purposes in the 1990s, X had a certain cool,” Stella Bugbee <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/style/gen-x-elon-musk-new-logo.html">wrote</a> this week in <i>The New York Times</i> . “It conferred a rejection of authority.” In the years since, <i>X</i> has retained cachet in Silicon Valley, where Google&#39;s X (formerly “Google X,” domain name: x.company) uses the letter to demarcate its secretive “moonshot” projects. A start-up accelerator associated with Stanford is called StartX. Indeed, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/problem-with-x-meta-microsoft-hundreds-more-own-trademarks-new-twitter-name-2023-07-25/">hundreds of other companies</a> , including Meta and Microsoft, have intellectual-property rights to <i>X</i> —which means that Musk and company could be facing lawsuits over the name soon.<br><br> <i>X</i> ’s ambiguity is what makes the letter so compelling. And, Pelkey noted, that&#39;s part of what makes it a good fit for Musk&#39;s troublemaking, boundary-pushing style: “The <i>X</i> mark is for extremes.”<br><br> <b>Related:</b><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-musk-x-rebrand/674818/">Why Elon killed the bird</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/meta-threads-social-media-platform-death-rebirth/674638/">Zombie Twitter has arrived.</a></li> <strong>Today&#39;s News</strong><br><br><li> Hunter Biden&#39;s plea deal over federal tax charges <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/hunter-biden-expected-plead-guilty-criminal-tax-case-rcna96232">is on hold</a> after a judge expressed concern over the terms for a separate felony gun charge.</li><li> Water temperatures around the tip of South Florida have <a href="https://apnews.com/article/record-hot-water-florida-coral-climate-change-6414d44c6f120507d3ee37c059fb75cd">reached triple digits</a> , and could be the hottest seawater measurement ever collected.</li><li> Seven major automakers plan to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/business/energy-environment/electric-vehicles-fast-chargers-automakers.html">invest at least $1 billion</a> to build a network of electric-vehicle chargers across the United States and Canada.</li> <b>More From <em>The Atlantic</em></b><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/authoritarianism-dictatorship-effectiveness-china/674820/">The dictator myth that refuses to die</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/07/new-york-picking-up-dog-poop/674825/">What kind of villain doesn&#39;t clean up after their dog?</a></li> <b>Culture Break</b><br><br> <b>Read.</b> The staff writer Ross Andersen <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/j-robert-oppenheimer-ideas-history/674814/">reflects on</a> J.

A former Navy pilot spoke of the mysterious objects that he has seen with his own eyes and through radar, and how frequently pilots encounter them in the air. A retired Navy commander described the time he pulled his jet up to a Tic Tac–shaped object hovering over the ocean, then watched it suddenly speed up and vanish.<br><br> The most anticipated remarks, however, came from a former military-intelligence officer named David Grusch, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/alien-intact-vehicles-ufo-us-government/674323/">went public with his account</a> just last month. Grusch told the House oversight subcommittee on national security that the American government has spent decades secretly recovering mysterious vehicles that have crashed on the ground, and has determined the material to be of “non-human” origin. The government also attempted to reverse engineer some of the technology, according to Grusch. And it&#39;s doing all of this clandestinely, without proper supervision by Congress.<br><br> In the hearing, Grusch expanded on his previous claims in response to lawmakers&#39; questions. If elected officials had never heard about this effort before, how did it get any funding? <em>The military pilfered money that had been allocated for its other programs</em> . A defense official recently testified before Congress that the US military hasn&#39;t found any evidence of extraterrestrial activity on Earth; is that statement correct? <em>It&#39;s not accurate.</em> Has any of the activity been aggressive or hostile? <em>My colleagues have gotten physically injured</em> . By UFOs, or by people within the government? <em>Both</em> .<br><br> After not holding a hearing on UFOs for more than half a century, Congress has recently held two in as many years. In that sense, we can count today&#39;s events as historic. But as in the other hearings, this one had no big reveal, no grand answer to humankind&#39;s most existential questions about our place in the universe. The hype surrounding the hearing—and there has been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/07/congress-ufo-hearings-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-real.html">considerable hype</a> —says more about the people who tuned in than about Grusch&#39;s claims. Just as it did in the late 1940s, when stories of flying saucers over Washington state and crash landings in New Mexico captivated the nation, UFO fever today indicates that Americans feel that their government knows more than it&#39;s letting on.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/alien-intact-vehicles-ufo-us-government/674323/">Read: Why everyone is suddenly talking about aliens</a><br><br> That sentiment is not new, nor is Americans&#39; belief in conspiracy theories. Though <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0270429">research suggests</a> that conspiracy thinking is not getting worse in the modern-day United States, we are in a moment of acute public curiosity about—and acceptance of—conspiracism. Compared with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">QAnon</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/microchipped-vaccines-15-minute-investigation/619081/">vaccine microchips</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/trump-voters-big-lie-stolen-election/629572/">stolen elections</a> , a big UFO cover-up might seem almost reasonable—even if that cover-up involves, as Grusch previously claimed in an interview, the military discovering the “dead pilots” of alien craft. (In Congress today, Grusch declined to give specifics about this and many other claims, saying that there was only so much he could disclose to the public and that he could elaborate in a closed setting.)<br><br> The past several years have coincided with an unprecedented mainstreaming of UFO culture. In 2017, when an interstellar object showed up in our solar system, most scientists agreed that it was an asteroid or a comet, but some said it could have been an alien spaceship. (The Harvard professor leading the latter camp, Avi Loeb, recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/science/avi-loeb-extraterrestrial-life.html">led an expedition</a> to the seafloor to recover material that he believes could be from alien spacecraft.) Later that year, <em>The New York Times</em> and other news outlets revealed that the Pentagon had a covert program dedicated to cataloging UFOs. Then NASA decided to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/06/nasa-ufo-uap-research-team/661229/">weigh in on the topic</a> after years of steering clear, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/nasa-ufos-conspiracy-theories/674259/">convened a team</a> to consider UFOs in a “scientific perspective.” And who can forget <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/02/unidentified-flying-objects-chinese-spy-balloon-american-alien-ufo-obsession/673068/">the spy balloons</a> that the military shot out of the sky this year?<br><br> These events have unfolded against a shift in public knowledge about the universe beyond Earth, which might help explain why people are interested. In the 1940s, the only planets we knew of were the ones around our sun, and scientists had only recently determined that there were galaxies other than our own. Today, astronomers have discovered more than 5,000 exoplanets, and telescopes can see nearly all the way back to the Big Bang. In the face of so many wonders, the question of whether we&#39;re sharing them with anyone else becomes more urgent, and might even seem more answerable. “I think people are just ready or at least excited about the possibilities of alien contact, maybe more than ever,” Jacob Haqq Misra, an astrobiologist at the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, told me.<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/nasa-ufos-conspiracy-theories/674259/">Read: NASA learns the ugly truth about UFOs</a><br><br> Congress has contributed to this mainstreaming too. Under the instruction of lawmakers, the Pentagon last year established a special office dedicated to investigating reports of unexplainable phenomena in the sky, at sea, and on land. The effort has been unusually bipartisan, with both far-right Republicans and progressive Democrats calling on the military to be more transparent. This month, Senator Chuck Schumer <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/politics/ufo-records-schumer.html">introduced</a> legislation that would create a commission with the authority to declassify government documents about UFOs. “The American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena,” Schumer <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-rounds-introduce-new-legislation-to-declassify-government-records-related-to-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-and-ufos_modeled-after-jfk-assassination-records-collection-act--as-an-amendment-to-ndaa">said</a> in a statement.<br><br> Yes, we do. But <em>some undisclosed documents about UFOs</em> is not synonymous with <em>incontrovertible evidence that aliens have visited Earth</em> . UFOs are just that—objects that are flying, and that we cannot yet identify. If the military is misusing taxpayer money to investigate mysterious debris it doesn&#39;t recognize, that&#39;s bad, whether it&#39;s the remnants of drones from another nation or a non-human craft. “If that&#39;s the case, and auditors have not been allowed into these programs and there&#39;s illegal layers of secrecy,” Haqq Misra said, “then that&#39;s really important to disclose, independent of any connection to anything else”—anything otherworldly. But even as lawmakers assert that UFOs are primarily a national-security concern, by invoking aliens in their discussions, they lend credence to the idea that a connection between the two exists.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/05/congress-pentagon-ufo-hearing-aliens/629910/">Read: What the UFO discussion really needs</a><br><br> Grusch was careful to tell lawmakers that he was only “speaking to the facts as I have been told them”—that is, he has not seen any evidence of alien wreckage or its inhabitants himself. And in general, though his claims are steeped in the language of authority, he simply has not been able to offer any concrete proof. The news website that first published Grusch&#39;s claims reported that the Pentagon had cleared him to speak publicly, but that means only that his remarks don&#39;t contain classified information, not that they&#39;re true. Testifying under oath before Congress is not a measure of truth, either. Outside the hearing, some lawmakers<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/igorbobic/status/1684291248461426706">seemed</a> like they didn&#39;t know what to make of the claims.<br><br> The prospect of extraterrestrial interlopers may be a national-security question, but it&#39;s also a scientific one. Science requires data, and secondhand accounts just aren&#39;t data. “When NASA brings back rocks on the moon, those rocks are shared with qualified people,” David Spergel, an astrophysicist at Princeton who chaired NASA&#39;s committee on UFOs, told me. “Imagine we had some samples of some craft, [and] we really want to understand what it was. You would make materials from those small samples available for labs anywhere in the world.” In other words, meaningful testimony would <em>show</em> evidence of alien ships and pilots, not just tell the public about them. “That would be pretty awesome,” he said, but it&#39;s not what we&#39;ve got. Today, we heard some extraordinary claims, and, to quote Carl Sagan, they require extraordinary evidence.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 22:40:49 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/ufo-fever-congress-hearing-aliens/674835/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/ufo-fever-congress-hearing-aliens/674835/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[‘The Country’s Already Been Destroyed’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Israel&#39;s political crisis is about the sense that something deep, sacred to many, has broken. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/LuGeh9m3oBqWpAXEs9RFwzkS2r8=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/israel/original.jpg" alt="一名抗议者在举着以色列国旗的人群中举起火炬" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Ilia Yefimovich / AP</figcaption></figure> E <span class="smallcaps">ran Schwartz</span> looks like a fighter pilot. The 40-something appeared last week on the Israeli television show <em>Ofira and Berkowitz</em> —a black V-neck T-shirt over his trim, athletic chest; his black hair cut short—to defend his decision to end his service in the air-force reserves. “We&#39;re not the ones who tore up the social contract,” he said. “We swore to serve a state that is Jewish and democratic. And if Netanyahu is going to end Israel&#39;s being a liberal democracy, it&#39;s the country that violated the contract, not us.”<br><br> Member of the Knesset Matan Kahana, another pilot on the show, agreed with Schwartz that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was dragging the country to “the destruction of the Third Temple.” He insisted, though, that the pilots were wrong to end their service, “because that&#39;s Judgment Day weaponry.” And he warned of the consequences: “Refusal to serve will destroy the army; it will rip the country apart.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-limit-supreme-court-power-protests/674819/">Natan Sachs: Israel on the brink</a><br><br> “And the country isn&#39;t already being ripped apart?” Ofira Asayag, one of the hosts, shot back. “The country&#39;s already been destroyed.”<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n that one line,</span> Asayag captured precisely what millions of Israelis are feeling. The political crisis in Israel is no longer about being in favor of the judicial reform the Netanyahu government pledged to enact, or about opposing it. It is no longer about law; it is about the almost complete erosion of any trust millions of citizens have in the government. It is about the sense here that something deep, sacred to many, has broken, the feeling that, as Asayag put it, “the country&#39;s already been destroyed.”<br><br> Later in the show, she asked Schwartz the tough question his stand provokes: “If there&#39;s an emergency, if we&#39;re attacked, are you or are you not getting in a plane?” Schwartz dodged. Asayag saw him squirming, heard his voice cracking, stared him in the eye, and asked him a question Israelis hardly ever ask a fighter pilot: “Why are you crying?”<br><br> “I&#39;m not crying,” Schwartz replied.<br><br> But that wasn&#39;t entirely true, he acknowledged a moment later. “I&#39;m thinking of my grandfather,” he added. “He was one of the builders of this country … There was an unwritten contract between all of us, that we are all one people, and that we are at war here for one reason—to be secure in our own land. That is what Benjamin Netanyahu is destroying. He&#39;s leading us to the destruction of the Third Temple, and now my grandfather, with whom I can no longer speak—I have to explain to him that I&#39;m not serving this country? It&#39;s breaking me inside … My heart is broken.”<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">srael has become</span> a country of broken hearts, a nation of people paralyzed with disbelief that matters have come to this. Reservists, a crucial component of the fighting readiness of the Israel Defense Forces, have dropped out of voluntary service by the thousands, to the derision of some and the adulation of others. They served in air-force squadrons, cyberwarfare units, the medical corps, special-operations formations akin to the Navy SEALs—there is hardly an elite unit that has not been hit. Both Herzi Halevi, the IDF chief of staff, and Yoav Gallant, the defense minister—a member of Netanyahu&#39;s governing coalition—have been strikingly blunt in noting that the IDF&#39;s fighting capabilities may well have already been badly dented.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/benjamin-netanyahu-coalition-israel-democracy/672693/">Yossi Klein Halevi: Netanyahu&#39;s betrayal of a democracy is a betrayal of Israel</a><br><br> Nor is it clear that the army can be healed. If Israel chooses to withdraw from parts of the West Bank or is forced to do so, will religious soldiers—who now account for a significant majority of officers, and who are largely opposed to territorial compromise—obey the orders? Despite their disagreement with the government&#39;s policy, they did obey during the 2005 disengagement from Gaza. But if the opponents of judicial reform are now refusing to serve, other groups might one day do the same. Does a country that has been at war since its founding still have a functioning army? The answer is far from obvious.<br><br> C <span class="smallcaps">ritics of the protest movement</span> that has filled Israel&#39;s streets week after week make two simple claims. First, they say, it has long been clear that Israel needs some manner of judicial reform. Second, they remind those who will listen, this government was democratically elected. And some of those who ran (though, notably, not Netanyahu) were direct about their intentions if elected. So what the protests amount to, these critics claim, is the privileged class that founded the country—tech entrepreneurs, pilots, doctors, professors, judges, finance workers—being sore losers after their electoral defeat. Israel&#39;s demographic makeup has changed radically since the country&#39;s founding; the descendants of the founders are now a minority, and they might as well get used to it.<br><br> Many of the protesters acknowledged the need for judicial reform, but insisted that Netanyahu&#39;s proposal went too far. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r-5u_lT6TIc27SjireMrlNux1roM72C/view">Centrist academics</a> agreed with them. More ominous, the protest movement made clear to everyone that millions of Israelis were frightened by the proposed changes. Slow it down, they begged. Let&#39;s have a national conversation, or a constitutional convention, as was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.asefam.org/_files/ugd/e56056_068dba527b5c4005a11440cdea743084.pdf">suggested</a> by Netta Barak-Corren, a highly regarded Hebrew University law professor.<br><br> But those pressing for far-reaching and immediate reform—including Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Simcha Rothman, the chair of the Knesset Committee on Constitution, Law, and Justice—would have none of it. They told Netanyahu that if he hesitated, they would bring down his government.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/02/israel-palestine-west-bank-illegal-settlement-netanyahu/672944/">Read: From this hill, you can see the next Intifada</a><br><br> As the fateful vote was unfolding in the Knesset on Monday, Israelis were captivated by the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/tv-report-last-minute-compromise-idea-has-collapsed/">image</a> of Netanyahu sandwiched between Gallant, who was pleading for compromise, and Levin, who warned that he would tear down the government. The old Benjamin Netanyahu, master operator and manipulator, had withered. He&#39;d appointed Levin acting prime minister while he had a minor heart procedure earlier in the week. Netanyahu was out of sedation, Israelis quipped, but Levin was still running the government—right into the abyss, using his parliamentary majority to thumb his nose at all the elites who make Israel an economic, technological, academic, cultural, and military power. He ignored everyone who begged him to show some restraint, shredding the last pretense of a social contract.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">lmost every assumption</span> Israelis shared about how they might live together has now been torn asunder. Netanyahu brought the ultra-Orthodox parties into his government, as he has always done in the past. The <em>Haredim</em> , as they are known in Hebrew, are convenient coalition partners. They have no interest in foreign policy or most domestic issues; even holding on to settlements is hardly a major concern for them. They consistently make but two demands of whatever government they join, whether left, center, or right: They want government funding for their school system, and they want a continuation of the policy initiated by David Ben-Gurion, Israel&#39;s first prime minister, exempting young Haredi men from military service. Haredi schools teach little math or English, leaving their graduates utterly unprepared to enter the workforce, and exempting young Haredi men from military service so that they can continue studying in yeshivot further limits their exposure to secular society.<br><br> Ben-Gurion made the deal in Israel&#39;s early years because he assumed that the Haredim would be an anomaly in a modern, Jewish state, a vestige of pre-Holocaust European Jewry that would soon die off and disappear. But Ben-Gurion got that entirely wrong. The Haredim now constitute a massive economic and political force in Israel. Whereas 400 exemptions from military service were given each year in Ben-Gurion&#39;s time, by 2010, the number of Haredim excused from military service through the same arrangement had reached 62,500 annually—an increase of 15,000 percent, while Israel&#39;s overall population had grown only 1,200 percent.<br><br> Israel&#39;s previous government, headed by Naftali Bennett for a year and Yair Lapid for a shorter period, required Haredi schools that receive government funding to begin teaching basic secular studies. The Israeli public still took umbrage at Haredim not serving in the army, but seemed slightly assuaged by what appeared to be progress.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/09/yair-lapid-bibi-netanyahu-israel-extremism-centrism/671483/">Jeffrey Goldberg: The man who could end the Netanyahu era</a><br><br> So when Netanyahu reached a coalition deal with the ultra-Orthodox parties to again exempt their schools from offering secular studies and promised to pass a law permanently exempting their young men from military service, the unhappy but long-standing tolerance snapped. Protesters decrying the proposed judicial reform chanted about “equality.” Everyone understood they meant not only equality of rights, but equality of obligations. The protesters said they were done paying for the Haredim and protecting them. “They&#39;re sucking our blood,” one TV commentator <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-05-21/ty-article/israeli-tv-host-under-fire-after-accusing-haredim-of-being-bloodsuckers/00000188-3dee-d7fa-a1dc-bdef92100000">said</a> . She was roundly criticized and forced to apologize, even as many privately applauded the sentiment.<br><br> Rage at the ultra-Orthodox was compounded when Netanyahu tried to appoint Member of the Knesset Aryeh Deri, the leader of a Haredi party, to the position of finance minister. Deri was jailed after a 2000 conviction for taking bribes, was convicted of tax evasion a decade later, and then resigned from politics as part of a plea deal. Netanyahu is himself a defendant in several serious cases, but contends that as long as he is prime minister, he cannot be sent to jail. His plan to rehabilitate Deri&#39;s career stoked outrage not only at the prime minister, who seemed to drop every norm for the sake of his own freedom, but at the Haredim as well.<br><br> Yedidia Stern, a former dean of the law school at Bar Ilan University and head of the Israel Democracy Institute, is now president of the Jewish People Policy Institute. He is widely regarded as one of Israel&#39;s leading jurisprudential figures, and is also known to have a soft spot for the Haredim, for whose way of life he has great admiration. But, as he later told me, Stern went to see Deri at his home in March, as the brouhaha was unfolding. “You&#39;re about to make thousands of Haredi children hungry,” Stern told him. Deri looked puzzled. “You&#39;re in power now,” Stern explained. “But the left or the center is going to come back into power, now, in half a year, in a year, or maybe longer. But sooner or later, it is bound to happen. And when it does, the new government will not care one whit how hungry your children are, that their only hot meal a day comes from their school. The voters are going to completely turn off the spigot of government funding, and your community is going to sink even lower into poverty.”<br><br> Deri, Stern told me, stared at him in silence for a long moment. It was clear, Stern recalled, that Deri had suddenly understood.<br><br> Two weeks ago, Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, also a Haredi, responded to rumors that Netanyahu was going to drop the elimination of judicial review, by far the most controversial element of the judicial-reform package, from his legislative agenda. The Haredim see ending judicial review, a step that would prevent the Israeli Supreme Court from overriding a law permanently granting Haredi men military exemptions, as crucial. Goldknopf told reporters that ending judicial review was “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/haredi-minister-pm-promised-me-override-bill-imperative-for-coalition-survival/">a necessary condition</a> ” for the government&#39;s survival.<br><br> What Goldknopf had inadvertently done was signal to the hundreds of thousands of protesters in the streets that the notion that ending judicial review was about fixing a broken judicial system was mere pretense. The actual agenda was ending the court&#39;s ability to block the government&#39;s capitulation to the Haredim. Rage exploded again.<br><br> A few days later, though, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-20/ty-article/.premium/israeli-ultra-orthodox-newspaper-calls-for-rethink-of-judicial-overhaul/00000189-72fb-de4e-adeb-ffffb4240000"><em>Yated Ne&#39;eman</em></a> , a leading Haredi newspaper, seemed to back down. It reiterated its longtime stance that “democracy is fundamentally foreign to us” and that the Haredim are in exile in Israel no less than they were before the state existed. Still, it said, it would be unwise for Haredim to take a stand in the conflict. The editorial was a signal that many Haredim now fear they have overreached, and seek to avoid becoming collateral damage to the anger now sweeping across Israel.<br><br> S <span class="smallcaps">ome observers,</span> leading American Jewish philanthropists among them, have tenaciously held on to the hope that the Haredi world can slowly be opened. Even among the Haredim themselves, there are those who hope that the Haredi establishment will be punished for the role it has been playing in Israeli politics for decades.<br><br> Esty Shushan, the eldest of 12 brothers and sisters, is herself the mother of just four. That alone makes her a rebel within the Haredi world. She is a poet, a filmmaker, and the head of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nivcharot.com/our-team">Nivcharot</a> , an organization seeking to get Haredi women elected to the Knesset.<br><br> But she and her colleagues, she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxMzc9PwyAUwPG_Bm4jlB8FDhw6G07aRBe3MwJr0VJmW239782WWHd5-STfl_ecnUObxx8dB5dTHNpdSDb20GvmC8klDLoopRKCFgWFnbZKceGoYlScFQ5eYFlyZymRjpCSYxj1Q_V0oCWg9en18vK-MmfOyS-nz-Hgm_CI17VNzcfb8avhsbZx3qf9cXgGDF__ovY2XU6w1908XyZAK0AMIGZZFjTEb9fZMc_IZRR7QAzBhAJicHk1u23yWgDCFdukNvFN9e6P1X_Gm8RW5f0ZA0ft2zz6OAGGp872ISHrUOx_AwAA__8lalvd">acknowledges</a> , are a fringe group. The rabbis at the helm have no interest in women politicians, no tolerance for Haredi feminists, and, despite the disaster that secular illiteracy is for a younger Haredi generation, no interest in opening the community to the Western world. True, she admits, the younger generation manages to get information from the outside world even on “kosher” phones (which block most of the internet), because they have WhatsApp. Yet even with that flow of information, which her generation did not have when they were young, the power of the establishment shows no signs of cracking.<br><br> Shushan was asked in a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxMzc9PwyAUwPG_Bm4jlB8FDhw6G07aRBe3MwJr0VJmW239782WWHd5-STfl_ecnUObxx8dB5dTHNpdSDb20GvmC8klDLoopRKCFgWFnbZKceGoYlScFQ5eYFlyZymRjpCSYxj1Q_V0oCWg9en18vK-MmfOyS-nz-Hgm_CI17VNzcfb8avhsbZx3qf9cXgGDF__ovY2XU6w1908XyZAK0AMIGZZFjTEb9fZMc_IZRR7QAzBhAJicHk1u23yWgDCFdukNvFN9e6P1X_Gm8RW5f0ZA0ft2zz6OAGGp872ISHrUOx_AwAA__8lalvd">interview</a> what that younger generation needs to know. That the money the Haredim just won from the government is not going to get to the children who need it, she replied. It will go instead to a select group of leaders who could not be less interested in what will serve the needs of their flock.<br><br> Can a firebrand like Shushan engender a renewed conversation inside the Haredi community? She now has more than 20 young women working with her, she says, which is astonishing growth from where her organization was a decade ago, when she started it. But she&#39;s a woman. She&#39;s a feminist. She&#39;s a filmmaker. She&#39;s outside the norm in every way, marginalized with no obvious avenue for making a difference. The Haredi world will hurtle on into a collision with the rest of Israeli society, she fears—even though everyone would benefit from changing course.<br><br> E <span class="smallcaps">ven Israel&#39;s intellectual right</span> has been shaken by the tsunami of rage reshaping the Jewish state. Assaf Sagiv (with whom I used to work at the Shalem Center) is widely regarded as Israel&#39;s preeminent conservative public intellectual. But Sagiv has broken with the government (which he repeatedly says he hopes will fall) and with most of his former colleagues. On social media, he has been spewing vitriol deriding the government, its members of the Knesset, and its supporters.<br><br>为什么？ “Conservatism is a cooling ethos,” Sagiv said in a lengthy <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-03-03/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/why-this-leading-israeli-right-wing-figure-is-praying-for-the-governments-fall/00000186-a4b3-d3d5-a7e7-aeb7a19b0000">interview</a> with <em>Haaretz</em> , Israel&#39;s flagship left-leaning newspaper. “It&#39;s a movement that also prefers compromise over disputes. Religious Zionism was once a conciliatory, bridging force,” but those days are behind us.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1930/10/zionism-in-palestine/306754/">From the October 1930 issue: Zionism in Palestine</a><br><br> How did the Israeli right go so wrong? Sagiv says that the brand of conservatism at the heart of Israel&#39;s coalition is a direct import of populist American conservatism. But that, Sagiv said, is the last thing Israel needs: “American conservatism gives us a peephole into the future, and it doesn&#39;t bode well. The Republican Party is a political, moral and cultural disaster zone.”<br><br> “The Israeli right is now positioning itself behind a program that is no less than a constitutional coup,” Sagiv told the newspaper. What should Israelis expect if the plan is put into play? “The dismantlement of the state&#39;s institutions … splitting the spoils between party bosses who are battling one another for power and resources, loss of public security, looting of the public coffers and deterioration into general lawlessness.”<br><br> S <span class="smallcaps">agiv&#39;s prediction</span> is now being tested. The Knesset passed the first plank of the judicial-reform package late Monday. Almost immediately, renewed protests erupted across Israel. The police, worried that people were about to scale the security fences of the heavily guarded Knesset, called in reinforcements. In Tel Aviv, thousands of protesters blocked the Ayalon, the city&#39;s main highway, shutting it in both directions for hours.<br><br> Later that night, the police had had enough. They brought in water cannons to soak the protesters, and mounted officers rode their horses directly into the crowd. Israelis went to sleep with images of violence and utter bedlam playing on their television screens.<br><br> When they awakened the following morning, many were stunned to see that several of the country&#39;s newspapers had printed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://danielgordis.substack.com/p/the-ideological-roots-of-democracy">identical front pages</a> : Nothing but black, top to bottom, and the words “A dark day for Israeli democracy.”<br><br> Later that morning, leading news outlets <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/ry8dvep9n">announced</a> that United Torah Judaism, one of the key Haredi parties, was submitting a Basic Law—a piece of legislation with constitutional status—that would declare, once and for all, that Haredi men who study Torah would be considered to have served the country. Netanyahu&#39;s Likud put a stop to the move, this time at least, but the mere mention of the proposal gave Israelis a taste of what the future was likely to hold.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu/618358/">Read: &#39;Netanyahu is playing fire with the democrats&#39;</a><br><br> Every news outlet, it seemed, was trying to make sense of what had just happened. Would the opposition ask the Supreme Court to overturn the law that had been passed the previous night? It appears that it will, and most knowledgeable observers believe that there is a good chance the court will intervene. But what if the government then says that it does not recognize the court&#39;s authority?<br><br> David Barnea, the director of the Mossad, told a group of his concerned operatives what would happen if it suddenly became unclear who was in charge of the country, Israel&#39;s Channel 12 reported. “If things come to a constitutional crisis,” he assured them, “I will be on the right side”—intimating that he would side with the court against the government.<br><br> What that would look like is difficult to imagine. The security establishment against the government? The government denying the Supreme Court&#39;s authority? The tacit agreements that have held Israel together for 75 years are unraveling at an unimaginable pace.<br><br> Where does that leave us? The truth is that no one knows. Which made it hard to disagree when, the morning after the Knesset vote, former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gave voice to our worst fears. Israel, he said, “is heading into civil war.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 16:13:42 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/-israel-netanyahu-political-crisis-supreme-court/674829/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/-israel-netanyahu-political-crisis-supreme-court/674829/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Dictator Myth That Refuses to Die]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Authoritarians would have you think that they can do certain things better than their counterparts who have to deal with checks, balances, and public opinion.

Sources: Getty.</figcaption></figure> Last week, at a Fox News town hall (where else?), former President Donald Trump called China&#39;s despot, Xi Jinping, a “brilliant” guy who “runs 1.4 billion people with an iron fist.” Lest anyone doubt his admiration, Trump added that Xi is “smart, brilliant, everything perfect. There&#39;s nobody in Hollywood like this guy.”<br><br> Trump is not alone. Many in the United States and around the globe see the allure of a dictator who gets things done and makes the trains run on time, no matter the rules or laws that stand in the way. According to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/democracy-maybe">repeated polling</a> , roughly one in four Americans agrees with the statement that a “strong leader who doesn&#39;t have to bother with Congress and elections” is desirable. A much higher proportion of citizens <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2017/10/16/democracy-widely-supported-little-backing-for-rule-by-strong-leader-or-military/">agrees with that sentiment</a> elsewhere, including in some of the most populous democracies: 55 percent of Indians, 52 percent of Indonesians, 38 percent of Nigerians, and 31 percent of Japanese.<br><br> This grass-is-greener view of authoritarian rule tends to emerge most often where governments are failing to meet popular expectations. When democracy delivers, dictatorship doesn&#39;t seem like a rosy alternative. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2017/10/16/democracy-widely-supported-little-backing-for-rule-by-strong-leader-or-military/">Only 6 percent</a> of Germans and 9 percent of Swedes are seduced by strongmen.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/democracy-hold-customer-service-airline-insurance-junk-fees/673201/">Brian Klaas: Democracy has a customer-service problem</a><br><br> Admiration for autocracy is built on a pernicious lie that I call the “myth of benevolent dictatorship.” The myth is built on three flimsy pillars: first, that dictators produce stronger economic growth than their democratic counterparts; second, that dictators, unswayed by volatile public opinion, are strategic long-term thinkers; and third, that dictators bring stability, whereas divided democracies produce chaos.<br><br> Two decades ago, the United States and its Western allies became embroiled in Iraq and later blundered into the financial crisis, leading think tanks to begin <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fpc.org.uk/publications/the-beijing-consensus/">praising the “Beijing Consensus,”</a> or the “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/03/why-the-china-model-isnt-going-away/274237/">China Model</a> ,” as an alternative to liberal democracy. Critiques of democracy surged in popularity in the era of Trump and Brexit. In the United States, intellectual publications ran articles arguing that the problem was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2016/04/america-tyranny-donald-trump.html">too much democracy</a> . In 2018, <em>The Times</em> of London published a column titled “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/our-timid-leaders-can-learn-from-strongmen-3xhqhk0zw">Our Timid Leaders Can Learn From Strongmen</a> .” China&#39;s state media, capitalizing on the West&#39;s democratic woes, argued that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/03/14/china-paper-says-rise-of-racist-trump-shows-democracy-is-scary/">democracy is a “scary” system</a> that produces self-inflicted wounds.<br><br> But events and new research in the past several years have taken a wrecking ball to the long-standing myth of benevolent dictatorship. All three pillars of the lie are crumbling. Every fresh data point <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/the-worst-form-of-government/">proves Winston Churchill right</a> : “Democracy is the worst form of Government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time.”<br><br> Let&#39;s start with the myth that dictatorships produce stronger growth. This falsehood arose from a few well-known, cherry-picked examples, in which despots oversaw astonishing transformations of their national economy. Starting in the late 1950s, Lee Kuan Yew helped transform Singapore from a poor, opium-filled backwater into a wealthy economic powerhouse. And in China, per capita GDP rose from nearly $318 in 1990 to more than $12,500 today. Those successes are eye-popping.<br><br> But a systematic evaluation of the overall data reveals another reality. Even with these outliers of strong growth, most rigorous studies have found <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dpsa.dk/papers/Nyrup_DPSA.pdf#cite.0@bjornskov2018regime">limited or no evidence</a> that authoritarian regimes produce better economic growth than democratic ones. Some researchers, such as the political economists Darren Acemoglu and James Robinson, have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/205014/why-nations-fail-by-daron-acemoglu-and-james-a-robinson/">found compelling evidence</a> that the inclusive political institutions of democracy are one of the strongest factors in producing stable, long-term growth.<br><br> When authoritarian regimes do succeed economically, they often do so at a cost, because even booming dictatorships are prone to catastrophic busts. As the political scientist Jacob Nyrup has written: “China has within a 50-year time frame both experienced a famine, where 20-45 million people died, and an economic boom, where hundreds of millions of people were lifted out of poverty.” The rosiest interpretation of the authoritarian economic data, then, is that autocrats may sometimes preside over marginally higher growth, but with a much greater risk of economic collapse. That&#39;s not a wise trade-off.<br><br> However, the myth of strongmen as economic gurus has an even bigger problem. Dictators turn out to have manipulated their economic data for decades. For a long time, they&#39;ve fooled us. But now we have proof: The reason their numbers sometimes seem too good to be true is that they are.<br><br> Every government has motivation to fudge its economic data. But democracies have institutions that provide oversight and block politicians from that impulse, ensuring accurate figures. No such checks exist in dictatorships.<br><br> That difference led Luis Martinez, an economist at the University of Chicago, to test whether despots were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/350051528721174623-0050022018/original/Nightlights.pdf">overstating their growth rate</a> . He did so with an ingenious method. Previous studies have verified the presence of a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-economics-080217-053355">strong, accurate correlation</a> between the amount of nighttime light captured by satellites and overall economic activity. When economies grow, they emit more nighttime light (which is why you can clearly pick out cities on <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://earth.google.com/web/@37.49351744,-84.10377216,1070.56549039a,7585747.77774096d,35y,0h,0t,0r/data=CisSKRIgMGY3ZTJkYzdlOGExMTFlNjk5MGQ2ZjgxOGQ2OWE2ZTciBWVhcnRo">a nighttime satellite image</a> , and why the density of light is so much lower in Africa than, say, in Europe or on the American East Coast). High-resolution images allow researchers to track changes in nighttime illumination over time, and the detailed, granular data these images produce are nearly impossible to manipulate. Martinez discovered an astonishing disparity suggesting that dictators have been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://harris.uchicago.edu/news-events/news/qa-luis-martinez-exposes-way-dictators-exaggerate-economic-performance">overstating their GDP growth</a> by about 35 percent.<br><br> And the more the numbers are checked, the more manipulation is exposed. In Rwanda, where <em>The New York Times</em> has named President Paul Kagame <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/08/magazine/paul-kagame-rwanda.html">“the global elite&#39;s favorite strongman”</a> because of his apparently brilliant record of economic growth, the government claimed that it had decreased poverty by 6 percent from 2010 to 2014. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://roape.net/2017/07/26/faking-rwandan-gdp-growth-myth/">Researchers found</a> that the inverse was true: Poverty had actually surged by 5 to 7 percent. Fittingly, the notion that Benito Mussolini <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-15/stop-saying-mussolini-made-the-trains-run-on-time">made the trains run on time was a lie</a> ; he built ornate stations and invested in train lines used by elites, but the commuting masses got left behind.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/01/xi-jinping-china-economy-jack-ma/617552/">Read: The undoing of China&#39;s economic miracle</a><br><br> Even China, the apparent authoritarian economic miracle, is showing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2023/07/18/china-economy-gdp-decline-deflation-real-estate-zero-covid/">signs of slowing down</a> , its growth model <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/china-economy-outlook-growth-model-globalization-exports-middle-income-trap-2023-7?r=US&amp;IR=T">no longer so well matched</a> to the global economy. Such cracks in growth are an innate feature of autocracy. Because dictatorships criminalize dissent, normal mechanisms of economic feedback are broken, and the system doesn&#39;t self-correct when blundering into economic mistakes. Beijing&#39;s quixotic quest to maintain perpetual “zero COVID” was a case in point. Autocrats are adept at building ports and roads and mines. But thriving modern economies are sustained less by open mines than by open minds, of which dictatorships, by design, have a limited supply.<br><br> Advocates for the myth of benevolent dictatorship conveniently ignore a crucial fact, which is that much of the growth in autocracies comes either from manufacturing products that were invented in the more open societies of the democratic West, or from exporting goods to rich democracies. (The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://oec.world/en/profile/country/chn">top destinations</a> for Chinese exports are the United States, Japan, and South Korea.) In that way, even the outliers of autocratic growth depend for their success on the innovation and consumer wealth of democracies. Would China have lifted millions out of poverty through export-led growth quite so fast if democratic America hadn&#39;t become an economic powerhouse first?<br><br> The myth&#39;s second pillar turns out to be no less rickety than the first. It holds that dictators are more strategic long-term thinkers than democrats because they&#39;re not beholden to fickle public opinion. But this lie is believable only if you don&#39;t understand how most dictatorships actually work.<br><br> Over more than a decade, I&#39;ve <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/corruptible-who-gets-power-and-how-it-changes-us-brian-klaas/16255009?ean=9781982154103">studied and interviewed despots</a> and the henchmen who surround them. One conclusion I&#39;ve drawn is that making decisions based on bad information is an intrinsic feature of the systems dictators run. The longer despots cling to power, the more likely they are to fall into what I call “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/putin-dictator-trap-russia-ukraine/627064/">the dictator trap</a> ,” in which they crush dissent, purge anyone who challenges them, and construct their own reality through propaganda, all to maintain control. Speaking truth to power in such a system can literally be deadly. As a result, dictators are told only what they want to hear, not what is true, and they begin to believe their own lies. Vladimir Putin&#39;s catastrophic war in Ukraine is a tragic illustration of the dictator trap: Putin got high on his own supply, and innocent Ukrainians are the victims of his power trip.<br><br> Despots often use their power not for long-term planning, but for short-term self-glorification, as no end of examples can attest. Turkmenistan&#39;s former dictator Saparmurat Niyazov blew millions to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-11095257">build, in his own honor, a golden statue</a> that would rotate to always face the sun. In another stroke of genius, he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4307583.stm">closed all rural hospitals</a> so that the sick could have the privilege of being treated in his pristine marble capital of Ashgabat. Most of the population lived outside the city, and countless thousands likely died because they couldn&#39;t reach a hospital in time. His successor erected an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-54894828">enormous golden statue</a> of his favorite breed of dog. Thankfully, democracies have checks and balances to suppress such narcissistic whims.<br><br> The most persistent pillar of the myth, however, is the one that holds that dictators produce stability. Some dictators have hung on to power for decades. Before his death, Muammar Qaddafi ruled Libya for 42 years. Paul Biya of Cameroon, an 89-year-old despot <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/africa/2023-01-23-africas-oldest-president-forgets-where-he-is-while-addressing-global-summit/">who had no idea where he was</a> during a recent event, took office during the Vietnam War. Putin has been in power for more than two decades; Xi has ruled for only one so far, but he appears prepared to retain his position indefinitely.<br><br> To stay in power, authoritarian leaders face constant trade-offs. If they strengthen military or paramilitary leaders, they face the risk of a coup d&#39;état. But if they weaken their men under arms, then they can&#39;t protect themselves from external invasion. To keep their elites happy, despots need to make them rich through corruption—usually at the expense of the population. But a ruling class awash in ill-gotten gains could inspire a revolution, or a wild card: assassination. Autocrats appear stable, but they&#39;re not. They&#39;re constantly vulnerable, forced to make every decision based on what will stave off threats to survive in power.<br><br> The stability that does exist in autocracies is, ironically, derived partially from the trappings of democracy. Recent research has made clear that dictators have developed mechanisms to “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ciaotest.cc.columbia.edu/journals/twq/v37i4/f_0033652_27429.pdf">mimic democracy to prolong autocracy</a> .” Most authoritarian leaders now <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300246650/how-to-rig-an-election/">hold elections, but rig them</a> . Some use parliaments or courts to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/rule-by-law/64D05AB3BEAFEE4C86E01883B9A143DC">enact unpopular decisions</a> while avoiding blame.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/12/the-autocrats-are-winning/620526/">From the December 2021 issue: The bad guys are winning</a><br><br> Eventually, though, dictatorships tend to fall apart. And when they collapse, they <em>really</em> collapse. Elections in democracies change governments, not regimes. Personalist dictatorships, by contrast, often implode. When Qaddafi was killed, Libya disintegrated. He had deliberately designed the political system to function only with him at its center. The same could be true of Putin&#39;s Russia. When he is toppled or dies, the country won&#39;t have a smooth, peaceful transition.<br><br> The often-disastrous demise of autocrats creates a negative feedback loop. Nearly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/events/Geddes927.pdf">seven in 10 leaders of personalist dictatorships</a> end up jailed, exiled, or killed once they lose power. While in power, many despots are aware of this grim fact, and so they use violence to stay in power, often growing more extreme as they lurch toward their downfall. The effect can hardly be called “stability,” even if the same person occupies the palace for decades.<br><br> For anyone who still clings to the illusion that dictatorships are likely to be prosperous, strategically wise, or internally stable, I propose a simple test. Imagine that someone wrote down the names of all the countries in the world on little slips of paper and then separated them into two hats: one for democracy, one for dictatorships. You would select one of the two hats, draw a slip of paper from it, look at the name, and then spend the rest of your life living in that country. Who knows, maybe you&#39;d get lucky and end up in an authoritarian regime that seems stable and is producing steady growth. But I know which hat I would choose. And even if you fantasize about finding the unicorn that is a benevolent strongman, I suspect you do too.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 14:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/authoritarianism-dictatorship-effectiveness-china/674820/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/authoritarianism-dictatorship-effectiveness-china/674820/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The 2024 Election Could Be the End of the Cases Against Donald Trump]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The most powerful office in the nation presents his best chance to terminate the cases against him. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/c1zeQnPhyPUyfW_SccJ8rdMC4tQ=/0x0:3514x1977/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_1439325943-1/original.jpg" alt="唐纳德·特朗普戴着“让美国再次伟大”帽子的照片" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> McNamee / Getty</figcaption></figure> If, as seems likely, Donald Trump is the Republican presidential nominee next year, the 2024 elections will be a referendum on several crucial issues: the prospect of authoritarianism in America, the continuation of a vibrant democracy, the relationship between the executive branch and the other two branches of government, and much else of grave significance.<br><br> It will also be a referendum on whether Trump will ever be held legally accountable for his actions. Trump faces multiple civil suits and at least two criminal indictments (with two more seemingly just over the horizon). If Trump were to win reelection, it is almost certain that none of these will ever be resolved—at least not in a way that is adverse to his interests, which any reasonable system would admit as a possibility. Such is the power of the presidency.<br><br> Take the simplest cases first: his pending indictment in Florida for violations of the Espionage Act relating to the retention of classified documents, and his anticipated indictment for actions relating to the January 6 insurrection. If Trump is elected, neither of these cases will ever result in a final judgment of Trump&#39;s guilt (much less incarceration).<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-second-term-isolationist-fascism/674791/">Christopher R. Browning: A new kind of fascism</a><br><br> The Mar-a-Lago documents case is set to go to trial in May 2024. Although many people suspect, not without foundation, that this trial date will slip, let us indulge the possibility that the trial occurs as scheduled and that sometime in June or July 2024, a jury convicts Trump. There is virtually no doubt that Trump would appeal such a verdict, and there is likewise almost no doubt that the presiding judge, Aileen Cannon, would allow him to remain free on appeal.<br><br> I have handled several criminal appeals in my career. None has ever been resolved, in even the simplest of cases, in less than a year. That&#39;s just the way our appellate system works; there is no sense of urgency to the proceedings at all (nor, to be clear, should there be in the normal course of business—the trial has concluded and the record is complete; a mature and thoughtful review of those proceedings requires time). The result is that Trump&#39;s appeal of his federal conviction (assuming one is secured) will quite likely still be pending before the Eleventh Circuit, the court with appellate jurisdiction over federal trials in Florida, at least through mid-2025—well past the election and into the next presidential term. And even were an appeal to be concluded quickly, Trump would inevitably then petition the Supreme Court for review, taking yet more time.<br><br> A similar calendar will apply to the possible January 6–related charges that may soon be brought by the special counsel in Washington, DC Even if that trial were to occur more quickly than the one in Florida (say, for example, in March or April of next year—a big if, given that the federal courts would have to negotiate an efficient trial that does not conflict with the one scheduled for March in New York), the chances of an appeal to the DC Circuit, which has jurisdiction over the federal court in the nation&#39;s capital, and thence to the Supreme Court in less than 10 months is near zero.<br><br> In short, it seems to me that no possibility exists that any of the federal charges against Trump will be final before January 20, 2025—none at all. And it seems equally certain that one of the very first acts of the Trump-appointed attorney general (whoever that may be) would be for the DOJ to move to dismiss the case or cases against the president at whatever stage they are then pending. Put simply, if Trump wins reelection in November 2024, the federal cases against him will likely be terminated, without final resolution, within 24 hours of his inauguration. That doesn&#39;t mean these proceedings will have been worthless. If Trump has been convicted in either trial, America will have the benefit of a historical record that determines his criminality. But that will be little comfort as we endure another four years of his rule, and as he continues to avoid any semblance of actual accountability.<br><br> The situation is more complex when we turn to the state charges Trump faces in a case already pending in New York and another anticipated shortly in Georgia. By definition (at least insofar as the Constitution is concerned), those states are separate sovereigns, and the federal government under Trump cannot direct that those cases against him be dismissed—nor could Trump pardon himself for his state crimes, because his pardon power is, likewise, limited to federal matters. So those cases will proceed.<br><br> But boy will they be difficult to bring to resolution.<br><br> To begin with, we can count on the Trump-led DOJ arguing that a sitting president is immune from prosecution by a state, at least during his time in office. And their claim will have some merit. After all, if the New York and Georgia district attorneys can try Trump while he is in office, the prospect exists that any elected official in a state opposed to the president might use his or her power to go after the president on local criminal charges. What&#39;s to stop an elected Republican prosecutor in a very red state from bringing bogus charges against President Joe Biden?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/trump-hunter-biden-indictment-plea-deal/674543/">Kate Shaw: The reactions that reveal everything about Trump vs. Biden</a><br><br> The risk is more than hypothetical. We have already seen how elected attorneys general are using their powers in ever more politicized ways. The leap from “justified” prosecutions to “unjustified” ones lies mostly in the eyes of the beholder. That&#39;s why, more than 50 years ago, the Watergate special prosecutor&#39;s office actually sided with the president on this score, stating that “considerations of federalism would bar his indictment in state court.” Nothing in the text of the Constitution prohibits state prosecution of the chief executive, but nothing authorizes it either, so the question has never been definitively resolved. But if Trump is elected, we can be sure that it will be—and what this Supreme Court would decide is anyone&#39;s guess.<br><br> Nor is that the only legal hurdle that the state prosecutors will need to overcome.  Trump&#39;s efforts to have his New York prosecution moved to federal court have thus far been rejected, as have the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-us-cant-replace-trump-e-jean-carroll-slander-suit">federal government&#39;s efforts to replace Trump in some of the civil suits against him</a> . Those arguments will, however, have substantially greater force if Trump returns to office; his status as a federal official and the disruption to governmental activity that would arise from his personal liability to civil suit would become significantly more palpable. The Trump-appointed AG would be all but sure to press them in court to the maximum extent possible.<br><br> Other challenges may be less legal and more practical in nature. Were New York and Georgia to persist in their cases, the nature of Trump&#39;s retaliation would be limited only by his imagination. What, for example, would happen if he tried to pull federal-law-enforcement funding from those two states? What if he directed the FBI to withdraw from cooperative investigative efforts? What if, in Republican-led Georgia, he pressured the state legislature to pass laws limiting the power of the Atlanta DA or requiring her to dismiss the case? The country should not have to answer these questions.<br><br> The prospect that Trump will almost certainly avoid accountability for his criminal conduct if he is reelected is just a small subset of the broader threat he poses to the rule of law. But it is an emblematic possibility redolent with the odor of kingly prerogative. Sadly, the reality is clear: When Americans go to the polls in 2024, if Trump is a candidate, they will not simply be choosing between two political alternatives; they will also be making one of the most important choices in the history of the country. They will be choosing between the modern conviction that no man is above the law and a return to a time when political leaders could act with impunity. Our own national character rests on what choice we make.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 12:18:49 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-2024-election-candidacy-criminal-appeal/674827/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-2024-election-candidacy-criminal-appeal/674827/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Wrath of Goodreads]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Authors are at the mercy of people who don&#39;t bother reading their work. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/DcJB2yRT39HblID42TYJ8YY2-uc=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/goodreads_final_3/original.jpg" alt="穿过书本的箭头" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic.

The young Irish writer looked at the book&#39;s listing there in the winter of 2020, the day the first proof copy arrived at her house. “Nobody but me and the publisher had seen it,” she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2023/07/goodreads-book-reviews-degrading-literary-culture">wrote</a> recently. “Despite this, it had received one review already: two stars, left by someone I had inconsequential personal discord with. It was completely impossible for him to have read the book.”<br><br> The terrible power of Goodreads is an open secret in the publishing industry. The review site, which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/04/the-simple-reason-why-goodreads-is-so-valuable-to-amazon/274548/">Amazon bought in 2013</a> , can shape the conversation around a book or an author, both positively and negatively. Today&#39;s ostensible word-of-mouth hits are more usually created online, either via Goodreads or social networks such as Instagram and TikTok.<br><br> Publishers know how important these dynamics are, and so they send out advanced reading copies, or ARCs, not just to independent booksellers who might stock a title, but also to influencers who might make content about it. “There&#39;s an assumption that if you receive an ARC that you will post about it,” Traci Thomas, host of the literary podcast <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thestackspodcast.com/about/"><em>The Stacks</em></a> , told me—“whether that&#39;s on your Goodreads, on your Instagram, on your TikTok, tell other people in your bookstore, or whatever. And so that&#39;s how it ends up that there&#39;s so many reviews of a book that&#39;s not out yet.”<br><br> Many book bloggers are conscientious about including a disclaimer on their posts thanking the publisher for giving them an ARC “in exchange for an honest review.” But disclosing freebies is far from a contractual requirement or even a social norm. So you can&#39;t easily discern which early reviewers have actually read the book, and which ones might be reacting to social-media chatter (or, as Nolan suspected in her case, prosecuting a personal grudge).<br><br> That matters because viral campaigns target unpublished books all the time. What tends to happen is that one influential voice on Instagram or TikTok deems a book to be “problematic,” and then dozens of that person&#39;s followers head over to Goodreads to make the writer&#39;s offense more widely known. Authors who reply to these attacks risk making the situation worse. Kathleen Hale—who was so infuriated by a mean reviewer that she tracked down the woman&#39;s address— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/18/am-i-being-catfished-an-author-confronts-her-number-one-online-critic">wrote</a> later that the site had warned her against engagement: “At the bottom of the page, Goodreads had issued the following directive (if you are signed in as an author, it appears after every bad review of a book you&#39;ve written): &#39;We really, really (really!) don&#39;t think you should comment on this review, even to thank the reviewer.&#39;” Most authors I know read their Goodreads reviews, and then silently fume over them alone. Because I am a weirdo, I extract great enjoyment from mine—the more petty and baffling the complaints, the better. “I listened to the audiobook and by chapter 3 it started to annoy me the little pause she made before the word &#39;male,&#39;” reads one review of my book, <em>Difficult Women</em> .<br><br> When the complaints are more numerous and more serious, it&#39;s known as “review-bombing” or “brigading.” A Goodreads blitzkrieg can derail an entire publication schedule, freak out commercial book clubs that planned to discuss the release, or even prompt nervous publishers to cut the marketing budget for controversial titles. Last month, the <em>Eat, Pray, Love</em> author Elizabeth Gilbert withdrew her upcoming novel <em>The Snow Forest</em> from publication because of the backlash she received after revealing it was set in Soviet Russia. The Goodreads page for <em>The Snow Forest</em> , which has since been taken down, accused her of romanticizing the Russian soul. “I&#39;ll cut the job for you—they don&#39;t have any,” wrote one reviewer. Another wrote: “Just like her characters in this nover [ <em>sic</em> ] are unaware of the events of WWII, Elizabeth Gilbert herself seems to be unaware of the genocidal war russia is conducting against Ukraine RIGHT NOW, because I&#39;m sure if she knew, she&#39;d realise how tone deaf this book is.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/06/elizabeth-gilbert-book-release-postponed-ukraine-war/674379/">Read: Eat, pray, pander</a><br><br> The book had been scheduled for release next February, but in a video announcing that it was “not the time for this book to be published,” Gilbert essentially endorsed the Goodreads criticisms: “I do not want to add any harm to a group of people who have already experienced and who are all continuing to experience grievous and extreme harm.”<br><br> Now, I don&#39;t know whether <em>The Snow Forest</em> romanticized the Russian soul or would somehow have caused “harm” to Ukrainians. Like my colleague Franklin Foer, I <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/06/elizabeth-gilbert-book-release-postponed-ukraine-war/674379/">find the allegations hard to believe</a> . But the plain fact is that neither of us know, because—and this should be obvious, although recent events suggest it is not— <em>you don&#39;t know what&#39;s in a book you haven&#39;t read</em> . You also don&#39;t know what&#39;s in a film you haven&#39;t watched, an album you haven&#39;t heard, or an article you haven&#39;t clicked on. That used to matter. It no longer does, because we live in a world where you can harvest likes by circulating screenshots of headlines and out-of-context video clips, and where marketing campaigns are big enough that they constitute artistic statements in themselves. ( <em>Barbie</em> , I&#39;m looking at you.)<br><br> Unfortunately, the artworks most likely to run into trouble in this viral hellscape are those that explore complicated, incendiary topics such as sex, race, and identity. Another Goodreads drama played out recently over <em>Everything&#39;s Fine</em> , a debut novel written by Cecilia Rabess and published on June 6. Its plot centers on a young, progressive Black woman who falls in love with a conservative white man in the lead-up to Donald Trump&#39;s election. “It obviously tackles some lightning-rod issues about race, class, and politics and identity in America,” Rabess told me, and so she expected strong reactions on Goodreads and similar sites. “But I think people certainly hadn&#39;t read the book. And so I don&#39;t know how they came to the conclusions that they did—that the book didn&#39;t handle these topics carefully or thoughtfully or intentionally.”<br><br> Chalk that characterization up as writerly understatement. “It&#39;s not enemies to lovers if you use it to excuse racists,” a typical one-star review <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NBNOok5wJxMJ:https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/62919844&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk">read</a> , referencing a common romance-novel trope. “Some authors shouldn&#39;t be authors bc wtf is this!?” another offered. “i haven&#39;t read this book nor do I plan to but having read the synopsis, I&#39;m rating it 1-star,” a third confessed.<br><br> In the case of <em>Everything&#39;s Fine</em> , the pile-on appears to have started on TikTok, where a handful of prominent creators criticized the book. The swell of anger then migrated to Goodreads, where those creators&#39; fans could register their disapproval. “i didnt and will not even read this i came from tiktok to say i hope the sales are so bad the bookstores have to throw away all inventory because it refuses to sell. anyone who gets an ARC of this should be ashamed,” noted another one-star review.<br><br> For Rabess, the experience was brutal. “As an artist, you&#39;re prepared for people to not resonate with the work,” she said. “But I think it feels different when people decide that you yourself are problematic, or you yourself are causing harm, or whatever language they use to describe it. It feels a little bit surreal.” The backlash might have flourished on Goodreads, but it soon escaped to the wider internet. Rabess, who is Black, received angry direct messages and emails, as well as abusive comments under any social-media posts she made. “They said nasty things about me, about my children. Called me <em>coon</em> , other really unpleasant slurs. Told me that I&#39;d be better off dead.”<br><br> The anger was scattershot. The commenters using racial slurs clearly knew Rabess&#39;s race, but she wondered if some other online critics assumed that she was a white author intruding on territory they felt should be reserved for writers of color. While authors are sensibly told not to read the reviews—and certainly not to engage with critics—that&#39;s harder when the critics come right up in your (virtual) face and shout their opinions at you.<br><br> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164999338-the-snow-forest">Read: The companies that are killing creativity</a><br><br> As it happens, the podcaster Traci Thomas was among those who disliked Rabess&#39;s book—albeit after reading an advance copy, back in January. “It&#39;s an icky book,” she told me. She objected to what she saw as the moral of the story: Love conquers all, even being a Trump supporter. “The boyfriend in the book, Josh, is wearing a MAGA hat and, like, saying racist shit to [the female protagonist]. And she&#39;s like, <em>It&#39;s fine</em> . And the big revelation for her is that she can still choose to love him. And I&#39;m just like: Okay, cool, go off—and I&#39;m gonna tear this book to shreds.”<br><br> Ultimately, Thomas concluded, “I don&#39;t know that the book needs to exist.”<br><br> Despite her own strong feelings, Thomas told me that she sometimes felt uneasy about her own reviews being surrounded by knee-jerk reactions and “performative allyship,” even by people whose politics she shared. “There are people who are new to anti-racism work or supporting LGBTQ people, or disability activism or whatever. And they feel it is their job to call out things that they notice without perhaps understanding the bigger historical context.” To illustrate the point, she gave an example: Imagine an author writes a book about Black children riding tricycles, “and then I&#39;ll see a review that&#39;s like, &#39;This book didn&#39;t talk about Black preschoolers who ride bikes, and they&#39;re also at risk.&#39;”<br><br> That dynamic explains one of the most initially counterintuitive aspects of viral pile-ons: that many seem to target authors who would agree with their critics on 99 percent of their politics. A strange kind of progressive one-upmanship is at work here: Anyone can condemn Ann Coulter&#39;s latest book, but pointing out the flaws in a feminist or anti-racist book, or a novel by a Black female author, establishes the critic as the occupant of a higher moral plane.<br><br> The net effect of this is to hobble books by progressive authors such as Gilbert, and by writers of color such as Rabess. The latter is philosophical about the controversy over <em>Everything&#39;s Fine</em> , seeing the backlash as representative of the political moment she was exploring in the novel—of “people feeling a dearth of community and connection, and just wanting a way to connect, a way to express themselves or express their anger.”<br><br> Of course, if Goodreads wanted to, it could fix the review-bombing problem overnight. When services that rely on user-generated content are only lightly moderated, it&#39;s always a conscious decision, and usually a cold commercial one. After Gilbert pulled her novel from publication, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/01/amazon-goodreads-elizabeth-gilbert/"><em>The Washington Post</em></a> observed that Amazon, which reportedly paid $150 million for Goodreads, now shows little interest in maintaining or updating the site. Big changes to a heavily trafficked site can be costly and risk annoying the existing user base: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-21/reddit-blackout-previews-social-media-s-future-in-the-ai-era">Reddit</a> has recently faced down a moderators&#39; revolt for changes to how developers can access its tools, and Elon Musk&#39;s tenure at Twitter—or whatever it&#39;s now called—will one day be taught at business schools on a slide headlined “How to Lose Advertisers and Alienate People.” A purge of duplicate accounts might sweep up some fanatically devoted Goodreads users—people who can&#39;t bear to share their opinion only once—and make the site feel less busy and exciting.<br><br> Goodreads spokesperson Suzanne Skyvara told me by email that the site “takes the responsibility of maintaining the authenticity and integrity of ratings and protecting our community of readers and authors very seriously.” She added that Goodreads is working to “stay ahead of content and accounts that violate our <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/guidelines">reviews</a> or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/community/guidelines">community</a> guidelines” and has “increased the number of ways members can flag content to us.”<br><br> The main Amazon site has several measures in place to stop review-bombing: Reviews from verified purchasers of books are flagged as such to bolster their credibility, while the star rating is the product of a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-stars-ratings-calculated/">complicated algorithm</a> rather than simply an average of all the review scores. Goodreads could adopt even more stringent measures—but then, it isn&#39;t in the company&#39;s interests to reduce volume in favor of quality, because its entire appeal is based around being a grassroots voice. “Goodreads really needs a mechanism for stopping one-star attacks on writers,” the writer Roxane Gay<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/rgay/status/1668336078447869952?s=20">tweeted</a> after Gilbert&#39;s statement in June. “It undermines what little credibility they have left.” Traci Thomas agrees. In an email, she told me that she would like to see “verified users or reviews that get a check (or something) in exchange for proving they&#39;ve read the book.”<br><br> If Amazon will not put the resources into controlling the wrath of Goodreads, then what fairness requires here is a strong taboo: <em>Do not review a book you haven&#39;t read</em> . We should stigmatize uninformed opinions the way we stigmatize clipping your nails on public transport, talking with your mouth full, or claiming that your <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42880690">peacock</a> is a service animal. A little self-control from the rest of us will make it easier for writers to approach incendiary topics, safe in the knowledge that they will be criticized only for things they&#39;ve actually done.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 12:15:22 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/goodreads-review-bombing-amazon-moderation/674811/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/goodreads-review-bombing-amazon-moderation/674811/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Kind of Villain Doesn’t Clean Up After Their Dog?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>你可以把狗带到草地上，但你不能让他的人舀勺。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/WrG4WzNxadNyrdFX3WqlEU4AiMs=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/dog_poop/original.jpg" alt="一名男子匆忙从另一名男子身边走开，另一名男子带着两只小白狗站在消防栓附近。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>卡罗琳·德雷克/玛格南</figcaption></figure>某种物质正在纽约市复兴。在匮乏的时代，它又变得丰富起来。在经济通货膨胀时期，它是免费的，而且分发得非常慷慨，甚至可能现在就在你的鞋子上。这种物质是狗的排泄物，<em>很多</em>人对此感到愤怒。<br><br>为了应对投诉的增加，该市卫生局<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://people.com/pets/new-york-city-crack-down-on-dog-owners-not-picking-up-dog-poop/">于 2022 年宣布</a>，将严厉打击留下犬类同伴粪便的人类违法行为。在当时的一份声明中，卫生专员杰西卡·蒂施 (Jessica Tisch) 表示，将加大力度执行目前记录在案的 250 美元罚款。作为宣传活动的一部分，市议员埃里克·博彻 (Erik Bottcher) 发起了一项宣传活动，告知纽约人“没有便便仙女”。然而，2022年，该市仅因未清理狗粪而开出了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gothamist.com/news/nycs-sidewalks-covered-in-dog-poop-rule-for-pickup-hardly-enforced">18张罚单</a>。 2023年，311热线投诉量增长了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/01/hamilton-heights-is-neighborhood-with-most-dog-poop-in-nyc/">17%</a> 。<br><br><p lang="en">我们的狗便便新闻发布会上最精彩的部分是当我宣布没有便便仙子时失望的呻吟。严肃地说，我要感谢<a href="https://twitter.com/NYCSanitation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@nycsanitation</a>同意我在第 3 区派遣更多 Pooper Scooper 执法人员的请求<a href="https://t.co/X5Lq38biid">。 pic.twitter.com/X5Lq38biid</a></p> — Erik Bottcher (@ebottcher) <a href="https://twitter.com/ebottcher/status/1518223009202552835?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">2022 年 4 月 24 日</a>纽约市议员朱莉·梅宁 (Julie Menin) 也遭受了大量的不满。她告诉我，她的办公室已经“充斥着投诉”（她说只是“大量的投诉”），抱怨她的选民认为人行道垃圾增加了。大多数投诉都涉及学校周围的区域：孩子们踩在其中，婴儿车在其中滚动。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/dog-poo-environmental-tragedy/546611/">阅读：狗屎，一场环境悲剧</a><br><br>Menin 与我分享了最近的一项研究，研究人员发现，纽约市人行道上的每 100 毫升水坑中平均含有 31,000 个粪便细菌。她说，“相比之下，公共海滩在这种水平下就会被关闭”。<br><br>虽然我从来不认为纽约市的水坑是一个干净的游泳场所，但我同意，有这么多粪便细菌四处飞溅是次优的。事实上，虽然我还没有进行民意调查，但我很乐意假设<em>大多数</em>人都希望将意外接触粪便的情况保持在最低限度。然而，这仍然是全国范围内的一个问题。纽约甚至不是狗粪便问题最严重的城市；根据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dogadvisorycouncil.com/foul-play-americas-best-and-worst-behaved-dog-owners-revealed/">2023 年</a>对 Twitter 上的投诉进行的一项调查，这一荣誉属于西雅图。<br><br>这个问题显然更多地与人类有关，而不是与狗有关，狗不能自己收拾东西，事实上，它们是完美的。但人类知道得更多。那么为什么人类似乎无法解决这个问题呢？<br><br>现在，人们应该承担清理狗朋友之后的责任，这似乎是理所当然的。这种显而易见的现象让我想起了我曾经与一位大学室友发生的争执，他声称他来访的女友留在水槽里的盘子不是他的责任。那么——那么他们是谁的责任呢？ （我仍然很生气。）但是人们会在狗之后收拾东西的期望相对较新，并且最初被许多人认为是完全荒谬的。<br><br> 1978年，纽约州通过了一项法律，规定“每个狗主人都有责任……清除他或她的狗在任何人行道、排水沟、街道或其他公共区域留下的任何粪便。”尽管所谓的“粪便铲法”从技术上讲并不是第一部此类法律（新泽西州的一个小郊区纳特利于 1971 年通过了一项法律），但它却是美国公众对狗排泄物态度转变最常被认为的一项立法。时任纽约市动物事务局局长的艾伦·贝克 (Alan Beck) 在 1979 年<em>《环境》</em>杂志上发表的一篇论文中简洁地解释了其影响。“当纽约发生某件事并且有效时，它就会成为世界新闻，”他写道。<br><br>我与贝克（现为印第安纳州普渡大学动物生态学教授）谈论了为使该法律通过而付出的努力。他说，当时该法律最直言不讳的支持者之一是激进组织“Children Before Dogs”的领导人 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/nyregion/20lee.html">弗兰·李(Fran Lee)</a> 。李特别担心<em>犬弓蛔虫</em>，这是一种有时在狗粪便中发现的蛔虫，当儿童摄入时会变得特别有害。 （儿童吃狗屎的幽灵在某种程度上是狗屎活动团体中的一个<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jezebel.com/city-combats-dog-poop-problem-with-image-of-little-girl-514552269">普遍主题</a>。）李认为，应该要求狗只在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/20/archives/to-scoop-or-not-to-scoop-activist-fran-lee-maintains-that-dirty.html">人类公寓的范围</a>内大小便。尽管她的观点很极端——贝克回忆起她在新泽西州参加的一次演讲，会上她的对手——1966年至1973年担任纽约市市长的约翰·林赛(John Lindsay)向她扔了一袋袋狗粪，他站在她一边，至少在他认为狗粪是一个需要立法解决的问题方面是这样。<br><br>林赛于 1972 年提出了搭讪法，但遭到了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/20/archives/to-scoop-or-not-to-scoop-activist-fran-lee-maintains-that-dirty.html">愤怒</a>。一些动物权利团体反对它，担心强迫这项任务会导致人们抛弃他们的狗，或者更糟：默许这项法律可能会鼓励城市完全禁止养狗，一些人认为这是弗兰·李的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1972/08/20/archives/to-scoop-or-not-to-scoop-activist-fran-lee-maintains-that-dirty.html">最终目标</a>。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2020/12/it-okay-let-my-dog-sleep-my-bed/617328/">阅读：可以让我的狗睡在我的床上吗？</a><br><br>该提案没有通过，林赛的任期结束了。直到 1977 年埃德·科赫 (Ed Koch) 当选后，独家新闻运动才取得胜利。就在他上任之前，州参议员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/12/nyregion/franz-s-leichter-dead.html">弗朗兹·S·莱希特 (Franz S. Leichter)</a>和众议员爱德华·H·莱纳 (Edward H. Lehner) 在州一级通过了这项法律。该法律适用于纽约人口超过 40 万的城市（仅指纽约市和布法罗），规定未接车的人将被处以当时<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/16/nyregion/6-years-of-canine-waste-law-all-in-all-a-cleaner-new-york.html">25 美元</a>的罚款。贝克的部分工作是向居民解释法律“并不反狗”；他认为，没有垃圾的街道对狗来说更健康，并且会让养狗更容易被接受（即房东和弗兰·李类型的人）。<br><br>尽管不可能量化任何特定时刻人行道上狗排泄物的确切数量，但贝克告诉我，法律似乎很快就扭转了局面。 “在最初的几个月里，”他说，“人们开始感觉事情变得更好了，无论是真实的还是感知的。”现在，这个曾经激进的主张已成为该国大部分地区的常态。<br><br>如今，数十年的挖掘工作已经过去，但令人沮丧的是，这项任务仍然是一个需要在全市范围内开展公关活动的问题。大多数不接电话的人<em>必须</em>明白他们所做的事情是错误的。他们知道他们会给邻居留下不卫生的麻烦，如果他们在自己的社区这样做，也会给自己留下不卫生的麻烦。那么他们为什么要这么做呢？<br><br>德国社会学家马蒂亚斯·格罗斯（Matthias Gross）对这些犯罪分子背后的动机感到好奇，因此他花了 10 年的时间来<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2015/08/doctoral-feces/">跟踪他们</a>。他在一天中的不同时间在不同城市的公园里张贴，观察人们挖水和不挖水的行为，寻找规律；这些最终成为<em>《环境社会学》</em>杂志上的一份<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23251042.2014.965402">报告</a>——《自然垃圾：犬类同伴和在公共场合不专心便便的诱惑》。<br><br> “我刚刚发现整个现象，从社会学的角度来看，非常令人着迷，”格罗斯告诉我。他发现，人们不太可能在一大早去取货，但其中一些同样不会抢购的人<em>会</em>在下午抢购。格罗斯在报告中表示，人们实际上可能并不关心保持公园清洁，而是关心被视为好公民。它让人想起公地悲剧的概念——当人们获得公共事物（在本例中是共享的社交空间）的机会时，他们往往会表现得自私。但如果每个人都自私，公共资源就会被破坏。<br><br>格罗斯写道，为了掩盖他们忽视责任的事实，许多非独家报道者假装不知道他们的狗在做什么。 （我个人多次看到过这种特殊的举动。）“我看到狗主人如何使用 iPhone 假装他们没有看到狗在做什么，”他告诉我，并补充说这些设备“非常有助于有策略地假装你不知道发生了什么。”确实如此——在这种情况和其他情况下。<br><br>但是，当然，我们实际上无法知道这些人在想什么。格罗斯的报告主要限于观察，很大程度上是因为当他与狗主人讨论为什么他们选择不捡起狗刚刚排出的东西时，他们中的许多人对他大喊大叫。有人需要找到一种方法来进入他们的思想。<br><br>克洛达·莱昂斯-巴斯蒂安（Clodagh Lyons-Bastian）现在是北卡罗来纳州立大学传播系的讲师，当她还是一名研究生时，她就试图成为那个勇敢的灵魂。当她参与的北卡罗来纳州罗利市的一个公民咨询委员会开始收到有关狗弄脏当地孩子们做运动的公园的愤怒投诉时，她决定更仔细地研究发生这种情况的原因。<br><br>在一项针对 1,000 名当地狗主人的自我报告<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chass.ncsu.edu/news/2016/05/12/the-scoop-on-dog-poop/">调查</a>中，超过 60% 的人声称，当他们留下垃圾时，是因为他们没有袋子。其他主要类别是因为下雨等外部环境，或者因为他们位于树木繁茂的地区，并认为他们可以将其推到一边并继续前进。 “实际上没有人说，‘我只是没有这样做，因为我不关心我的社区，’”里昂-巴斯蒂安告诉我。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/11/how-dogs-make-friends-for-their-humans/417645/">阅读：狗如何为人类交朋友</a><br><br>但当这些人被问到为什么他们认为<em>其他人</em>留下了狗的粪便时，他们对他们的评价要严厉得多。 “你听说过基本归因错误吗？”里昂-巴斯蒂安问我。人们倾向于将自己的行为归因于环境或无法控制的事物，而将他人的行为归因于他们的性格。<br><br>里昂-巴斯蒂安调查的第二部分重点关注什么因素可能会促使受访者更频繁地接电话。她发现答案不是罚款，也不是责骂。相反，它采用了社会证明的心理学概念，这表明人们会受到周围人的决定的影响：“如果你的社区和圈子里的人正在做某事，你就更有可能这样做。”相反，如果你认为其他人没有做某事，你很容易想知道为什么你自己要费心去做。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-power-of-us-harnessing-our-shared-identities-to-improve-performance-increase-cooperation-and-promote-social-harmony-jay-j-van-bavel/9780316538411?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《我们的力量：利用我们共同的身份来提高绩效、加强合作、促进社会和谐》一书的合著者多米尼克·帕克（</em></a> Dominic Packer）也发现了这一点。 “激励人们遵守规范的因素之一就是认同感，”他说。传达这样的信息：纽约人是一群会照顾狗的人——与所有其他失败城市的人不同——可能会奏效。他说，强调行为<em>不良</em>的人数是行不通的，这表明行为不良是常态。对于所有那些华丽的新闻发布会来说，这都是一个不幸的消息。<br><br>对于一个估计有 50 万只狗的城市来说，纽约的合规性显然很高。无论纽约人看到流浪粪便有多恼火，他们都必须承认，他们每天遇到的这种情况并不是五十万次。也许<em>真正</em>有用的不是一个标语，责骂那些为其他人毁了狗的少数狗主人，而是一个标语，上面写着：<span class="smallcaps">我们都捡便便不是很棒吗？</span><br><br>尽管许多人将狗排泄物的增加归因于流行病，这<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/07/covid-dogs-return-to-work/">似乎</a>暂时导致了狗购买和收养的增加，但市议员朱莉·梅宁认为，问题实际上与标志有关：该市在 2013 年拆除了破旧的<span class="smallcaps">狗路边</span>标志，而不是用新标志替换。她说，“人们期望人们会在没有标志的情况下清理他们的狗”。 “但事实证明事实并非如此。”<br><br>梅宁发起了一场让居民设计新标志的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abc7ny.com/curb-your-dog-design-contest-waste-winner/13377498/">竞赛</a>，她计划将其挂在她所在的地区。获奖者名单于 6 月 12 日公布：一只手持骨头和铲子的小狗自由女神像的卡通形象，<span class="smallcaps">上面写着“人人清洁街道”的口号。追随你的小狗！</span>不如我的标志建议好，但仍然很可爱。<br><br>我问她是否认为任何低于 100% 的合规性都会被她抱怨的选民所接受，她没有回答，而是强调“情况真的不会比现在更糟了。” （不幸的是，这与宇宙的中心法则直接冲突：“事情总是会变得更糟。”）<br><br>我不认为期望城市完全没有狗的排泄物是合理的，我也不相信人类的不体贴行为可以通过立法完全消除。总会有异常值：那些没有带包的人，那些真正没有注意到他们的狗在做什么的人，那些有其他我们不知道的复杂因素的人。当然，混蛋总是会有的。这个问题很棘手，因为人类是不完美的。<br><br>因此，虽然关注你刚刚踏入的粪便是很自然的，但更健康（也更有效）的是，更多地关注你从未遇到过的所有狗粪便。大多数狗主人都在外面做他们邻居的铲子，他们和你一样对那些不这样做的人感到恼火。与那些人一起说：“是的，在[你居住的地方]，我们自豪地清理我们的狗……不像那个失败者城市西雅图！”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/07/new-york-picking-up-dog-poop/674825/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/07/new-york-picking-up-dog-poop/674825/</item></channel></rss>
