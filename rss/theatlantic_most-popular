class="smallcaps">为人父母总是充满不可预测性</span>：凌晨两点醒来、学校打来电话、那些让<em>我胃痛的</em>可怕话语。这种日常差异通常源于生病或受惊的孩子，并且是家庭生活基本动态的一部分。然而，今天的美国父母也面临着日益严重的外部干扰和旨在提供稳定的机构的退化。其结果是，许多家庭经常会因为一些问题而陷入困境，这些问题不仅仅是不方便，但还不是灾难性的。这会滋生父母的压力、不安全感和疲惫。简而言之，美国人已经进入了一个颤抖的时代。<br><br>过去半个世纪以来，这个国家一直在走这条道路。从 20 世纪 70 年代开始，一系列经济和社会政策决策导致了政治学家雅各布·哈克 (Jacob Hacker) 所说的从政府和企业到家庭的“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-great-risk-shift-the-new-economic-insecurity-and-the-decline-of-the-american-dream-jacob-s-hacker/9780190844141?affiliate_id=atl-347">巨大风险转移</a>”。黑客的想法主要指的是经济变化，例如私营部门从有保障的养老金转向依赖股票市场的401(k)s。但威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校的社会学家杰西卡·卡拉科告诉我，这种“DIY社会”的概念可以延伸到父母——尤其是母亲——被要求“把一切整合在一起”的多种方式。例如，双职工家庭的崛起并没有得到负担得起的儿童保育或强制带薪休假等政策的满足。相反，家庭被迫在混乱且竞争激烈的市场中穿行，以获得日托和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/01/summer-day-camps-activities-childcare/672837/">夏令营</a>等基本服务，而且他们在很大程度上依靠自己来应对任何故障。<br><br> <a

<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/17/health/formula-shortage-one-year-later/index.html">表示，在货架再次被填满后，他们对配方奶粉供应仍心存恐惧和焦虑</a>。<br><br>无论一个人的银行账户有多少，这种持续的不稳定都会造成情感上的损失。研究表明，自大流行之前以来， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2789946">父母的心理健康状况显着下降</a>，近年来，父母的疲惫感、倦怠感和<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/well/family/parental-burnout-symptoms.html">都很高</a>。大约四分之三的父母非常或有些担心<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.capita.org/thinkofthechildren">气候变化会伤害他们的孩子</a>或他们认识的其他幼儿。这种压力和不安全感很容易<a data-event-element="inline link"

20 世纪最后 25 年的父母更缺乏可预测性。正如斯坦福大学社会学家玛丽安·库珀 (Marianne Cooper) 在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/cut-adrift-families-in-insecure-times-marianne-cooper/9780520277670?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《漂流：不安全时代的家庭》一书中</em></a>所写的那样，风险大转移时开始的趋势在 2000 年代带来了收入的大幅增加和工作的不稳定。<br><br>此外，直到过去几十年，社会机构和债券已经做好了更好的准备来弥补这一差距。工会、兄弟会，尤其是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/religion-affiliation-community.html">信仰团体</a>不仅提供联系感，还提供物质支持，例如产后膳食或可以在紧要关头照顾孩子的值得信赖的人。这些网络的成员数量一直在稳步下降。<br><br>然而，永久的颤抖并不是不可避免的。政策制定者既可以稳定地面，又可以帮助家庭应对地震。第一步是将健康、可预测的家庭生活作为政策优先事项。加强儿童保育体系、提供强有力的带薪休假、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/17/irs-phone-wait-times-taxes/">对公共服务进行再投资</a>并降低<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/how-government-learned-waste-your-time-tax/619568/">其行政负担</a>以及限制及时调度的法律，都是将风险从家庭转移回政府和企业的方法。作为一项指导原则，政策制定者应减少混乱，解放父母和儿童，加深他们彼此之间以及社区的联系。<br><br>也许现状最可悲的是，这本应该是一个家庭充满奇迹的时代。我们生活在一个现代医学已经消除了许多儿童疾病并定期开发新<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-rsv-injection-infants-rcna94698">疗法</a>的时代。人们重新燃起对<a data-event-element="inline link"

[<em>笑声</em>] 邮差过来了，你知道，他向我脱帽致意，还有老人在遛狗。<br><br>而且，你知道，我不知道这个记忆是否准确，但我确实有这样的感觉：人们更加友善。<br><br><strong>朱莉·贝克：</strong>你是在<em>罗杰斯先生的街区</em>长大的吗？或者那是什么？<br><br><strong>松香：</strong>没有；我实际上是在纽约皇后区长大的。所以这可能是、当然不是真的。 [<em>笑声。</em> ]<br><br>这是<em>大西洋广播电台</em>。我是汉娜·罗辛。我邀请我的同事朱莉·贝克来谈论一些一直困扰我的事情。当人们谈论今天的情况比过去糟糕得多时。<br><br>他们会说“邻居以前比较友善，每个人都对你微笑并帮助你。”有时只是爷爷的闲聊，你几乎可以忽略它。有时又会变成“男人是男人，女人是女人”之类的事情，这更烦人。<br><br><strong><em>贝克：</em></strong><em>有一个善意的愿望，比如向邮递员致敬。然后是“哦，我们需要恢复 20 世纪 50 年代的社会秩序。”然后你会想，“哇，我们怎么到了这里？”</em><br><br>朱莉分析心理学研究和社会趋势，她还是另一个大西洋播客<em>“如何与人交谈”</em>的主持人。<br><br>她来这里是为了帮助我理解这项刚刚出现的非常有趣的研究，该研究表明人们坚信一切都变得更糟了。<br><br><strong><em>亚当·马斯楚安尼</em></strong><strong>：</strong><em>我一生都听到人们这样说，“你过去可以在晚上不锁门”，或者“你不能再相信别人的话了。”</em><br><br><em>我总是对这类言论感到恼火。所以部分原因是想证明每个人都错了。但其中也有一部分是这样的，</em>好吧，如果他们是对的，这就是一个大问题。<em>这就是我们开始的地方。</em><br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>那是亚当·马斯楚安尼。他最近在<em>《自然》杂志</em>上发表了一篇名为《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-illusion-of-moral-decline">道德衰退的幻觉</a>》的论文。亚当是一位心理学家，也是科学博客<em>“实验历史”的作者。</em>他花了十年时间系统地研究为什么我们感觉过去的情况更好……以及这意味着什么。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>我认为我读研究生的第一年是特朗普当选的时候。很明显，这是“让美国再次伟大”成为当今时代氛围的时刻。<br><br>看到“过去是好的，现在是坏的，让我负责，我可以带回美好的过去”的说法也让我明白，这比叔叔、姐夫和互联网上的人说的这些话要重要得多——这些说法引起了人们的共鸣，有助于让人们进入椭圆形办公室。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。我的意思是，我不得不说，这就是我对你的研究感兴趣的动机，因为我一直对为什么这句话引起如此强烈的共鸣有一种超然的好奇心。<br><br>比如，为什么——不仅是美国领导人，全世界的领导人——他们只要说：“哦，那时的情况好多了”，人们就会立刻明白这一点？就像，他们甚至不需要解释。你可以说：“你知道，让美国再次伟大。”这就像四个字，所有的假设都立刻就出现在人们面前。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。当我在学术背景下就这篇论文发表演讲时，我首先是特朗普就职演说的结尾，他在演讲中说：“你知道，我们将使美国再次富裕、再次自豪、再次安全、再次伟大。”我指出，这些句子中最重要的词不是<em>“美国”</em> 、 <em>“安全</em>”、 <em>“自豪”</em> 、 <em>“强大”</em>或<em>“伟大”</em> 。<em>又来了</em>。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是啊！<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>光是这个词就可以起到很大的作用。那就是：嗯，如果过去一切都很好但现在却不同了，那就意味着事情发生了变化。这意味着我们可以将其改回来。它唤起了一种失落感，但也唤起了一种恢复损失的可能性的感觉。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。<em>又</em>是这个词，就好像一个小小的词可以在情感上解决人们的一些问题。很难确切地理解它是如何工作的，但你<em>再说一遍</em>这个词，每个人都会说，“啊，你刚刚为我填补了一个洞。”你知道？当你说“道德沦丧”时，你到底是什么意思？如果这是一种幻觉，为什么感觉如此真实？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>关于人们在谈论道德衰退时可能会想到什么，有一些完全合理的假设。也许每个人的意思都是，“我听说 20 世纪 50 年代是一段非常美好的时光。所以我真正要告诉你的是，从那时起，情况已经有所下降。”并不是说过去10年情况变得更糟；而是说他们的情况在过去10年里变得更糟。你知道，20 年前或 50 年前，情况变得更糟。我们现在正生活在困难时期。<br><br>在后来的一项研究中，我们要求人们回溯得更早。 “那20年前呢？那40年前呢？”他们告诉我们的是——“在我到达之前，什么也没有发生。一切都很好。然后我出生了，然后一切就开始走下坡路了。”<br><br>特别有趣的是：你出生的时间并不重要。所以30岁的人告诉我们这发生在30年前。 60岁的人告诉我们这发生在60年前。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>等等，真的吗？那么从字面上看，人们认为衰落是在他们来到这个地球时就开始的吗？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。所以，我的意思是，我们不会问前一天或后一天。但我们提出的问题是：“评价一下当今人们的善良、诚实、友善和优秀程度。那你20岁的那一年呢？”人们告诉我们那时更好。<br><br> “那你的出生年份呢？”人们告诉我们，那时的情况甚至更好。然后我们问：“那 20 年前呢？那40年前呢？”<br><br>人们的答案没有什么不同。那条线是平的。直到我们问到“你出生20年后”时，电话才停下来。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>这太有趣了。我认为我没有完全理解这一点。因此，人们将生活中的任何个人困难或挣扎（现在也许是我的推断）投射到整个人类身上，就像他们将自己的寿命保护到历史的、更广泛的文化、政治寿命上。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。我的意思是，这是人们记忆的偏差，因为你没有出生之前的记忆。你确实拥有出生后大部分时间的记忆。<br><br>因此，如果这是一种记忆偏差，那么它在你出生的那一刻附近的某个时间就会开启，这是有道理的。显然不完全是这样，但这可以解释为什么我们看不到人们在出生之前和之后的想法。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>你年轻真的不重要吗？你知道，刻板印象显然是辛普森爷爷。就好像，老年人总是在谈论过去的事情如何更好，但年轻人却不一定。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的；我们完全期望也能找到这一点，但我们并没有真正找到。因此，当你问人们一生中所感受到的衰退时，年轻人和老年人所感受到的衰退并没有什么不同。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>朱莉，我很惊讶地发现老年人和年轻人对这种道德下降的看法没有区别。我的意思是，你不是一个老人；你是一个老人。你年轻。那么你还记得曾经有过这种感觉吗？<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>我清楚地记得我直到 2013 年搬到华盛顿才拥有智能手机。所以在那之前的几年里，当我住在芝加哥时，我记得在街上与陌生人进行了很多互动。<br><br>我绝对不会再像以前那样频繁地拥有这些了。我认为这只是因为我们都在看手机，对吗？所以我的一部分有点浪漫化了，你知道的，前智能手机时代的偶遇以及所有这些。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。当我听到你这么说时，我想，<em>哦，朱莉有这种感觉很好，我有这种感觉也很好。</em>但如果我把它乘以几百万倍，那么我就会得到“让我们回到事情更好的时代”的政治运动，而我真的不太喜欢。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>是的。这也让我想到的一件事是，一系列研究发现，美国的社会信任实际上几十年来一直在下降。因此，人们基本上越来越不可能说大多数其他人通常是可以信任的。<br><br>所以你完全正确，认为过去更好、人们过去更值得信赖确实有很大的政治影响。<br><br>对我来说，这感觉就像是一个先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题。比如，我们是否因为相信人们的道德品质变得更差而减少对他们的信任？或者我们是否认为人们变得更糟是因为我们与社区更加脱节？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>我们在这里关注一个非常狭窄的问题，即“人们在日常生活中对待彼此的方式是否随着时间的推移而改变？”人们认为它有吗？<br><br>这是一个当事情糟糕时，他们很容易看起来事情变得更糟的模型。所以我不认为这是我们可能发现这种幻觉的唯一领域，因为人们对生活的很多不同部分都这么说。<br><br>你知道：艺术比以前更糟糕了。这种文化比以前更糟糕了。教育制度比以前更糟糕了。但对我来说，很明显我们倾向于相信这是真的，即使事实并非如此。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>您在这项研究中的假设是——人们认为某种道德已经下降。但在你心里，它并没有下降。所以对你来说，这就像一个幻觉。我的意思是，你称之为幻觉。正确的？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>好的。那么根据这个假设，你的解释是什么？比如，为什么我们大多数人都会在妄想/幻觉下运作？就像<em>你</em>所说的事情显然不是真的。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>我们认为两种认知偏差可以结合起来产生这种错觉。所以这个解释有两个部分。第一个是我们所说的偏见曝光，即人们倾向于关注主要是负面的信息，尤其是关于他们不认识的人的信息。<br><br>因此，这既是他们收到的关于他们不认识的人的信息（主要是负面的），也是他们关注的信息的组合。所以这就是为什么当你看看你个人世界之外的世界时，它看起来充满了做坏事的人。他们撒谎、欺骗、偷窃和杀人。<br><br>解释的第二部分就是我们所说的偏见记忆。记忆研究人员注意到，坏记忆的坏处往往比好记忆的美好消失得更快。<br><br>因此，如果你的高中舞会被拒绝，当时的感觉会很糟糕。二十年后，这也许是一个有趣的故事。如果你有一个很棒的高中舞会，当时的感觉非常好。 20年后的今天，这仍然是一段美好的回忆。感觉虽然不如体验时那么美好，但感觉还是蛮不错的。<br><br>事实证明，平均而言，人们的记忆会发生这样的情况：坏的记忆比好的记忆更快地接近中性，而坏的记忆更有可能被遗忘，并且在回顾时变得更好。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>汉娜，当我读到这篇论文时，我想知道人们是否在某种程度上正在意识到世界正在发生真正的变化。<br><br>社会信任度下降，但也存在普遍的孤独感和脱节感，以及社区生活的侵蚀，即了解邻居的人越来越少，社区组织的成员人数不断减少。<br><br>所有这些事情肯定会对人们的个人生活产生影响。但我认为这表现为一种模糊的感觉，比如<em>，哦，交朋友更难了，或者感觉自己是社区的一部分更难了。</em><br><br>所以我想知道我们是否感受到了这种模糊和令人不安的脱节感，并给它一个错误的解释：事情过去比以前更好，而人们只是比以前更糟糕。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>哦，这真的很有趣。所以你说的感觉是真实的。就像，有些事情发生了变化的感觉是真实的，因为有些事情<em>已经发生了</em>变化。更多的是疏离感和孤独感。<br><br>所以我们编造了这个非常简洁的故事。就像，“当我还是个孩子的时候，事情变得更好了，人们也变得更好了，邮递员向他致敬”——我们就到此为止了。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>是的；确实有一些真实的事情正在发生，会让人们感到与周围的陌生人脱节。我想知道，是的，我们是否只是在心理上遇到困难，不知道为什么会这样。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong> Adam，我想介绍一下你的一些理论。一种可能是某些事情实际上已经发生了变化。我们只是用了错误的名字来称呼它。就好像，有些东西已经下降了。这是来自不同的关于社会信任的心理学研究。<br><br>我们的孤立感、联系感、面对面的接触都发生了变化。就像有些社会变化是真实的、结构性的，在我们身上留下了一个漏洞，我们错误地命名了<em>道德</em>。<br><br>当我们读到这里时，我们认为有些事情正在发生变化，这确实让我们有点绝望——也许我们只是叫错了它们的名字。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>就像我们有一种难以置信的强烈感觉，觉得有些事情出了问题，而“某事”是联系、社区或类似的东西。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。因此，很容易从“人们不像以前那样友善”变成<em>“事情</em>比以前更糟糕了”。因此，随着时间的推移，对机构的信任确实在下降。很多人还表示，人与人之间的信任随着时间的推移而下降。事实上，我认为这种情况比机构信任度的下降更为夸大。<br><br>理查德·艾巴赫 (Richard Eibach) 做了一些研究，探讨人们如何看待世界变得更加危险。他发现人们相信这一点。相信这一点的人尤其是父母。当你问那些父母“世界什么时候变得更加危险？”时，你会得到一个与他们第一个孩子的出生日期非常接近的日期。<br><br>明显的含义是世界没有任何变化。改变的是你的世界观。你知道，现在你必须保护这个脆弱的生命——因此你对世界上的危险更加敏感。这就是为什么你认为它们还有更多。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>你知道，朱莉，我一直和我哥哥进行这样的谈话，他总是告诉我他的孩子不安全。他住在纽约。他说：“我的孩子不安全。他们不能出去。他们不能走下街区。”就像，他真的吓坏了，你知道吗？而且：“这比我们小时候安全多了。”我说，“伙计，我们是 70 年代在纽约长大的，对吧？”确实不安全。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>就像统计上的那样。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>从统计上看。我给他看了新闻文章，我还拿出了一份联邦调查局的报告。我特意下载了一份联邦调查局的报告，其中显示了我们小时候纽约的犯罪统计数据。<br><br>他对此的信念是如此坚定。我无法让他动心。我无法向他展示足够的数字或统计数据让他思考，<em>哦，现在情况并没有更糟</em>。<br><br>我的意思是，亚当·马斯楚安尼实际上对此有一个术语。这对我的兄弟来说有点刻薄，但他的用语是<em>不劳而获的信念</em>。我认为他的意思正是如此。就像：你的信念非常强烈，即使你没有任何基础来支持你所附加的非常强烈的信念的故事。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>是的。我的意思是，不管联邦调查局的报告如何，你哥哥给自己讲的故事似乎在情感上引起了超级共鸣。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>我们告诉自己的关于自己生活的故事确实在某种程度上塑造了我们是谁。这真的很有趣，因为当我们向自己讲述这些关于我们个人生活的故事时，很多时候这些故事属于两类之一。一是救赎，二是污染。<br><br>因此，救赎的故事就像这样：“我经历了这些考验，并因此变得更加坚强，事情正在好转。”而污染故事则像这样：“这些考验征服了我，我现在已经崩溃了，从根本上来说，我是一个更糟糕的人。”<br><br>如果你听说污染序列对人们的心理健康不利，你可能不会感到惊讶。这项研究是根据我们讲述的个人生活故事完成的。但感觉就像我们在讲述一个关于全人类的污染故事。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>我想让我沮丧的是：为什么那些会粘在一起？我的意思是，美国社会有一些流行的救赎故事。<br><br>但我觉得，在历史上的很多时刻，现在就是其中之一，这些污染故事——比如“美国曾经伟大”或“俄罗斯曾经伟大”——有一种特殊的情感力量，可以真正团结人们。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>是的。我的意思是，也许这有点像你哥哥在纽约的恐惧，对吧？就像——那是发自内心的情感。这是您孩子的安全。所以，当然，这将会产生更强烈的影响。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>亚当，你发现人口统计数据之间有任何明显的差异吗？那么，如果不是老年人和年轻人之间存在差异，那么性别差异或具有不同政治意识形态的人之间又如何呢？<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni：</strong>我们没有发现任何性别差异。我们没有发现种族群体之间存在任何差异。我们没有发现任何教育差异。我们发现的唯一的其他人口差异是意识形态和政治方面的差异。随着时间的推移，那些自认为更保守的人比那些自认为自由的人感觉衰退更多。<br><br>但即使对于那些最自由的人来说，他们仍然说今天的人们比 10 年前、20 年前或过去的任何时候都不那么友善。所以这是保守派说得更大声，但自由派也这么说的。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>因此，自认为自由主义者的人可能会相信种族主义和性别歧视有所减少，但仍然相信其他普遍的普遍道德标志已经下降。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。事实上，他们似乎确实如此。在我们的研究中，当我们问他们“为什么？你在想什么？”对他们来说确实出现的一件事是有更多的宽容。种族主义、性别歧视、体能歧视越来越少；所有的<em>主义</em>。<br><br>所以，当人们说人们不像以前那么友善时，他们自然想到的似乎并不是这个。因为如果你直接问他们，“例如，你认为人们对待非裔美国人比过去更加尊重和礼貌还是更少？”，大多数人今天会比过去说得更多。<br><br>但如果你问他们，“今天人们是更友善了还是更不友善了？”他们会变得不那么友善。所以这不是他们回答问题时想到的。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。所以这是一种非常非常具体的感觉。我绝对认为人们彼此更加尊重，很大程度上是因为我们扩大了允许尊重谁的范围，以及控制人们身体和谁可以做出决定的父权观念。我的意思是，我们有很多方式打开了公平和公正的大门。当然，我宁愿活在今天，也不愿活在 50 年前。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的，我同意。因此，我认为特别令人惊讶的是，我确信还有很多其他人同意这一点。但即使是一些确实同意的人，他们似乎也这么想，<em>是的，但这实际上并不是来自人们的内心</em>。事实上，他们现在彼此之间的关系比以前还要糟糕。<br><br>是的;他们会说所有正确的事情或者他们会有正确的观点。但你知道，他们不会为你敞开大门，否则他们会尽可能地欺骗你。现在人们知道该说些什么，但他们仍然<em>做</em>更多的坏事。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>我们对认识的人有同样的感觉吗？它在我们的个人生活中的表现是否有所不同？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>实际上你也可以产生一种进步的错觉。实际上，您主要是听到认识的人的好话并体验到好话。所以我们认为，在你的个人世界中，这种衰落的幻觉可能会被拒绝、关闭甚至逆转。<br><br> And people told us: “People in general? Worse today than they were 15 years ago. People that I have known for the last 15 years? Better today than they were 15 years ago.”<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So Julie, one thing that Adam found that I thought was so interesting was that people we know—like our own people, people we&#39;re close to or whatever—they&#39;re somehow getting better over time, and yet the general public are getting worse. I don&#39;t quite understand how those fit together.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> So I guess we just think the moral decline is happening with strangers, with all those <em>other</em> people.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> And it seems like potentially the disconnection from community that many people are experiencing could just mean that we&#39;re slotting more people into the “morally compromised, untrustworthy” category.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right. Like, if we met more people and we had more casual acquaintances and we went to our bowling leagues or whatever, then we might include more people in that circle of people we know. And those people are good people. So that could sort of spiral upward rather than what&#39;s happening, which is a momentum downward.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Adam&#39;s study kind of seems to say that if you get to know people, then you won&#39;t think they&#39;re on a downward slope of moral depravity anymore.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> For one thing, Adam, it sounds to me like the problem is that people are absolutely certain. Like they&#39;re not questioning. Was the past a worse place? It&#39;s a sort of lack of humility. Because if you try to understand, “Well, maybe what did get worse?,” then you would come up with more specific and useful policy solutions.<br><br> I mean, I assume one reason you did this research is to point out a mistake. Like, we&#39;re all living under this delusion. And in your head—since you sound like a fairly optimistic person—is it “knowledge is power,” and people will know, and then they will stop? What&#39;s the aim, or what&#39;s your wish here?<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah. I mean, as a psychologist I a little bit despair of changing people&#39;s minds, because I know how difficult it is. It doesn&#39;t work the way that we think that it works, like, “Oh, you have the wrong model of the world. How about I give you the correct facts, and now you have the correct model of the world?” When does that ever happen? When has that ever happened to me? Like, never.<br><br> And one effect that I certainly hope that this has is: Whenever politicians or aspiring politicians make the claim that, you know, “Things used to be better, and put me in charge and I&#39;ll make them better again”—that&#39;s a very old thing that we&#39;ve heard many times. And it resonates with us, perhaps because we are primed to believe it, even when it&#39;s not true.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> So, Hanna, now that we know this is an illusion, right, that&#39;s very interesting. But will it actually change how you feel?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I don&#39;t really know. I mean, I feel like as a journalist, it depresses me a little bit because I spent a lot of time researching and marshaling facts, like I did with my brother. And to think that emotions ultimately squash all of that—I don&#39;t really know what to do with that.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Yeah.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> But in my own personal life, awareness is helpful. I don&#39;t think any bad can come from understanding your own emotional levers better. It&#39;s not that it immediately leads to a change, but I don&#39;t think it can ever be bad to understand, <em>Oh, I&#39;m having this emotional attachment or strong belief, and that&#39;s leading me to behave in this way.</em> That in and of itself is a small daily miracle. So that&#39;s good enough.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> <em>Listeners, if you enjoyed this conversation with Adam Mastroianni and Julie Beck, and if you generally like learning about these psychological levers that are guiding our choices, Julie hosts a full season of conversations much like this one, on the Atlantic podcast</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/how-to-build-a-happy-life/">How to Talk to People</a> . <em>You can find it wherever you listen to podcasts.</em><br><br> This episode was produced by Becca Rashid.

Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> No one <em>deserves</em> a seat at Harvard, but only some people are supposed to feel bad about the one they get.<br><br> Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that race-based affirmative action violated the Equal Protection Clause, spurring a news cycle about the admissions advantages conferred on certain people of color. The preferential admissions treatment that racial minorities received is just one bonus among many, however. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">new study</a> from the economic research group Opportunity Insights quantifies the advantages of wealth in higher education: The ultra rich are much likelier to gain admission to elite colleges than anyone else, even when controlling for academic success. Put another way, if you take a room full of 18-year-olds with the same SAT or ACT score, those from the top 1 percent were 55 percent more likely to be admitted than middle class applicants. Those from the top 0.1 percent are 150 percent more likely to get in.<br><br> For decades, underrepresented minorities have faced accusations of unearned access. The implication of these resentments has always been that some people who deserve to go to Harvard have had their spots “taken” by Black, Latino, and Native American students who, absent efforts to tip the scales in their favor, would never have been granted admission. But no one “deserves” to gain admission anywhere. No university can construct a perfectly meritocratic system. How should an admissions program distinguish among tens of thousands of standout students fairly? Is publishing a best-selling novel more important than a perfect GPA? If a student with a mediocre GPA but a perfect SAT score explains their academic deficiency by pointing out that they were taking care of their sick parent, is it reasonable for an admissions officer to consider them more “meritorious” than a student with perfect grades <em>and</em> scores?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Annie Lowrey: Why you have to care about these 12 colleges</a><br><br> Any method of distinguishing among such applicants is inherently subjective, and any of the traits, acquired skills, or backgrounds that help push students over the edge could be considered “unearned advantage.” But none of those carries the stigma that race-based affirmative action does. The whispers of affirmative action never leave the people of color who enter into elite spaces; they become the targets of resentment for the unfulfilled ambitions of their fellow students and, later on, their colleagues.<br><br> A 1995 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/affirm/stories/aa032495.htm">dispatch</a> from <em>The Washington Post</em> highlights these resentments: “They talk about a glass ceiling for women and minorities. There&#39;s a glass ceiling for middle-aged white male managers too,” a 52-year-old worker living in Georgia tells the reporters. Another man aptly addresses the zero-sum nature of the conflict: “Why should I suffer so they can have a better chance in jobs or anything for that matter.”<br><br> Or take this monologue from <em>The West Wing</em> ’s CJ Cregg about why she&#39;s “the wrong Democrat” to defend affirmative action: “After my father fought in Korea, he became what this government begs every college graduate to become. He became a teacher. And he raised a family on a teacher&#39;s salary, and he paid his taxes and always crossed at the green. And any time there was an opportunity for career advancement, it took him an extra five years because invariably there was a less qualified Black woman in the picture. So instead of retiring as superintendent of the Ohio Valley Union Free School District, he retired head of the math department at William Henry Harrison Junior High.”<br><br> CJ thinks her father hit a glass ceiling put in place by a “less qualified Black woman,” a common villain in these stories of stunted careers.<br><br> Affirmative action is an albatross, whereas other forms of unearned privilege are, if anything, a sign of belonging. Most legacy kids don&#39;t try to hide their ancestral claims; they are proud of them, and so are their parents, who come to campus decked in university apparel. A Class of &#39;87 cap screams status far more loudly than an earnest Proud Parent of … T-shirt. Nor do the kids who row crew or play lacrosse conceal their participation in these résumé-padding pastimes. Later on in life, they eagerly share that they once rowed for Stanford.<br><br> This isn&#39;t just about the top 1 percent or even 10 percent. In a system that requires subjective discrimination, <em>no one</em> is objectively best qualified. Men have a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/30/achieving-perfect-gender-balance-on-campus-isnt-that-important-ending-private-colleges-affirmative-action-for-men-is/">much easier time getting into elite schools than women.</a> According to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/3/26/regional-diversity-scrutiny/"><em>The Harvard Crimson</em></a> , 51.5 percent of the non-international students in the class of 2018 came from New York, New Jersey, California, or Massachusetts. Living in the United States is a form of unearned privilege as well; a genius in Ethiopia is less likely than the rich failson of an American lawyer to gain admission to one of our universities. It is perfectly legitimate for Americans to want our institutions to discriminate in our favor, but let&#39;s not pretend, then, that this is some fine-tuned exercise in picking the best and the brightest. The point is that we accept some forms of unearned advantage but not others. Born the son of a Harvard-educated lawyer who lives in Massachusetts? Fine. Born Black? Unacceptable.<br><br> In 2022, the linguist John McWhorter, who opposes both racial and legacy preferences in admissions processes, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/01/opinion/affirmative-action.html">wrote</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> that “however unfair it may be, legacy admissions do not reflect on white students or white people, broadly speaking, in the same way [as affirmative action does on Black people].” McWhorter skips right over <em>why</em> even as he refers to legacy preferences as an “embarrassment” for universities.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/ban-legacy-college-admissions-nepotism/629566/">Richard V. Reeves: The shame deficit</a><br><br> But preferential treatment for legacies and the elite isn&#39;t embarrassing. The reason that race-based affirmative action is not treated the same way as all of the other unearned advantages is because of the presumption that racial minorities don&#39;t belong in elite spaces. Elite people belong at Ivies. So do men. So do Americans. So do people who play water polo. So do flute players and the children of alumni. The unearned advantages we accept are the ones we have already decided are acceptable characteristics of the elite.<br><br> Could the Supreme Court&#39;s decision finally convince the general public that the Black students who <em>are</em> admitted belong? I doubt it. Jon Wang is one of the students who joined the plaintiffs in their successful effort to end race-conscious admissions. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/asian-american-student-claims-affirmative-action-prevented-his-admissions-but-california-law-doesnt-allow-that/">blames</a> affirmative action for his rejection from a number of schools. Among them: UC Berkeley. That university has been legally prohibited from considering race and ethnicity in admissions since the late 1990s, a change that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/affirmative-action-mismatch-and-economic-mobility-after-california%E2%80%99s-proposition-209">significantly drove down admissions</a> of underrepresented minorities across the University of California system.<br><br> The sooner we accept that no one <em>deserves</em> to be an elite, the better. Should a handful of private institutions benefiting from billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies and tax breaks and other public monies get to select our political, economic, and cultural leaders behind closed doors? Sure, it&#39;s better if they do so without employing harmful racial stereotypes. Better still if they stop putting their thumbs on the scale for the top 0.1 percent. But fighting over the appropriate racial composition of the future white-collar lawyers and corporate consultants of America only legitimizes the enterprise to begin with.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 13:45:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/harvard-admissions-affirmative-action-elite-colleges/674837/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/harvard-admissions-affirmative-action-elite-colleges/674837/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[‘It’s Really First-Class Work’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Watching <em>Oppenheimer</em> with Richard Rhodes, who wrote a definitive account of the Manhattan Project <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ila2DFKZYfKS9SJaSGJ3aKgB8OE=/0x83:1594x980/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/oppenheimer_inline_1/original.jpg" alt="希里安·墨菲 (Cillian Murphy) 在电影《奥本海默》中饰演 J·罗伯特·奥本海默" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Melinda Sue Gordon / Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure> <strong><em>This article containers spoilers for the film</em> Oppenheimer.</strong><br><br> Few authors have written as insightfully about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer as Richard Rhodes, whose 1986 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-richard-rhodes/9781451677614?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em></a> , is widely regarded as the definitive account of the Manhattan Project. Rhodes&#39;s comprehensive history, which won a Pulitzer Prize, is both a massive work of scholarship—the main text alone runs nearly 800 pages—and a literary feat that he conceived as “the tragic epic of the twentieth century.” Over the years, according to Rhodes, it has been optioned many times, but no film or television version has ever been made. “It&#39;s quite obvious why,” Rhodes told me. “It&#39;s just too big a story.”<br><br> Over the weekend, along with millions of other moviegoers, Rhodes saw <em>Oppenheimer</em> , Christopher Nolan&#39;s three-hour biopic of the physicist known as the father of the atomic bomb. The next day, curious about his reaction, I spoke with Rhodes by phone. He was deeply impressed by the film, especially in light of earlier attempts to adapt the same material. “It&#39;s really first-class work,” Rhodes said, comparing it favorably with Roland Joffé&#39;s <em>Fat Man and Little Boy</em> (“badly done,” from a technological perspective) and specifically praising Cillian Murphy&#39;s performance in the title role. “If anything, he was a little too confident. But Oppenheimer was pretty confident.”<br><br> We also discussed aspects of the story that weren&#39;t covered by the film, which Nolan adapted from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/books-briefing-kai-bird/674785/">the biography <em>American Prometheus</em></a> , by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Given its relentless concentration on Oppenheimer, the movie necessarily leaves a lot out, including plenty of what Rhodes called “drama on the industrial side” and the perspectives of scientists and victims who fall outside its protagonist&#39;s circle of consciousness. For the rest, viewers may need to return to Rhodes&#39;s own wide-ranging work, which expands beyond even the largest IMAX screen.<br><br> <em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em><br><br> <strong>Alec Nevala-Lee:</strong> Do you think that the film&#39;s picture of Oppenheimer is accurate?<br><br> <strong>Richard Rhodes:</strong> One time I asked [the physicist] Bob Serber if my portrait of Oppenheimer was anywhere close to the real human being. And Serber, who had a very dry wit, said, “It&#39;s the least wrong of all those I&#39;ve seen.”<br><br> And I think that applies here, because the difficult edges to Oppenheimer were, to some degree, sanded off. But there have been several Oppenheimers in past versions. The BBC did a series with Sam Waterston. He was wonderful, but he was much too nice. Then when the next version [the 2009 PBS docudrama <em>The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer</em> ] came around, [David Strathairn] played Oppenheimer as a hand-wringing neurotic, which really pissed me off when I watched it. You could not possibly have someone who did what Oppenheimer did in his life who was just sitting around shaking all the time with anxiety.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/">Read: <em>Oppenheimer</em> is more than a creation myth about the atomic bomb</a><br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Most viewers are probably encountering figures such as Lewis Strauss (the government official who orchestrated the notorious hearing that revoked Oppenheimer&#39;s security clearance, played by Robert Downey Jr. in a towering performance) and Leslie Groves (the military head of the atomic-weapons program, played by Matt Damon) for the first time.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> Yeah, I think Strauss, if anything, was depicted somewhat more pleasantly than he really was. I think he was even more nasty. And I was really surprised by Matt Damon, who did a damn good job. In fact, it gave me a different sort of perspective on Groves. I had pictured him as stuffier than he was depicted here, and I think this is probably closer to the truth. Groves was really a superb leader, and also anxious and insecure around the scientists. Which was a funny combination, because he drove them to get the job done anyway.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Was there anything else about the movie that surprised you?<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> Mostly minor things. I&#39;d read about the arrival of the shock wave after the light [from the Trinity test], but my God—when you see it in IMAX, it really hits you; it resonates in your chest. We were just knocked back in our chairs. I wish [Edward] Teller [Oppenheimer&#39;s nemesis in the debate over the hydrogen bomb] had been a little different. I spent an interesting 30 minutes with Teller and had some sense of what he was like. That guy [Benny Safdie] was a little too oily, not quite as sinister as Teller really was.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Nolan has always struck me as a pretty cerebral guy who also makes movies on the largest possible scale. It tracks to me that Oppenheimer, a theorist who found himself in charge of this incredible industrial operation, would appeal to him.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> That makes sense. My experience with writing books is, your best books are the ones that you have a deep emotional investment in. And there&#39;s an automatic tendency when you&#39;re writing a biography to turn the character in the biography into oneself.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Nolan, who is willing to play with structure, seems like a good choice for this story, because it allows him to deliver so much information. He can cut between the Manhattan Project period, the Oppenheimer hearing, and the hearing for Strauss&#39;s nomination as secretary of commerce, and use the dynamic to explain things to the audience.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> I had never thought about the parallel between Strauss and Oppenheimer before, but the story is structured so that both of them are destroyed by the forces of Washington, DC And that&#39;s really a wonderful sort of parallel. Oppenheimer&#39;s kind of a tragic hero, and I wouldn&#39;t give that credit to someone like Strauss. But in a kind of corrupt way, he followed the same arc across his life. That was a real insight that I haven&#39;t seen—maybe it&#39;s in the biography [ <em>American Prometheus</em> ].<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> I read it recently, and Strauss&#39;s hearing takes up just a single paragraph. But Nolan decides to make it a fifth of the movie, for the reasons you&#39;re saying. There&#39;s this fascinating parallel that is possible only in a movie—the thematic echoes and the rhythm of the editing provide a sense of closure that would be much more difficult in book form.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> You can do that, but you&#39;d have to have that insight. And Nolan had that insight. When you do research for a book, often you&#39;ll come across something that can be expanded upon. When I was working on <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> , I read a history of the development of physics in the United States. And in a footnote at the end of a chapter deep in the book, there&#39;s this note about [Enrico] Fermi, one day going up to the window and looking down at the gray winter length of Manhattan Island—alive with crowds—and cupping his hands together and saying, “A little bomb like that and it would all disappear.” The historian who wrote this book threw that away into a footnote. I made it the end of the whole first third of my book.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> The movie for the most part is very realistic, but dreamlike moments visualize Oppenheimer&#39;s psychological state, which reminded me of your book. The opening paragraph starts with the physicist Leo Szilard—whom you use in your book as a “clothesline” character, someone the audience can follow across a complex narrative—crossing the street, with a description of what the weather was like in London, and then it ends with a passage out of John Milton. And that elevates the tone in a way that tells you something about the material.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> That&#39;s what I was trying to do, of course. But I thought it was really off tone when [Nolan, in one of those dream sequences] had Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock screwing on the table in the security hearing. That was, I think, maybe a bit of an overreach. It&#39;s curious and interesting that they decided not to visit Hiroshima.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> I was wondering whether Nolan would show that, but every scene that&#39;s not about Strauss is from Oppenheimer&#39;s point of view. So instead of the bombing, you see him waiting for a phone call, because he has no control over how the weapon is used. There&#39;s an earlier scene where the characters talk about saving lives by heading off an American invasion of Japan. Is this something that would have been discussed before the bombing, or is this a rationalization that defenders of the decision arrived at after the fact?<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> Well, George Marshall [the US Army chief of staff during World War II] said we knew that the Japanese were getting their people trained to fight us. And we thought that if we could bomb the beaches with atomic bombs, we might shock the Japanese into surrender. In fact, there were plans to keep going. I found a memorandum from Oppenheimer to Groves saying if we make a design that uses both plutonium and uranium, we can have six bombs a month by October.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> If the movie had included that suggestion, it would have really changed the viewer&#39;s sense of Oppenheimer.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> There was also discussion in &#39;43 or &#39;44 of making radiation bombs stuffed with cobalt 60 or something that would just spread radioactive particles all over the place. We did some tests down in New Mexico, and I remember someone&#39;s comment afterward—it was the most god-awful stuff you could imagine. Which, yes, it would be, wouldn&#39;t it?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/richard-rhodes-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-ai/674777/">Read: The real lesson from <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em></a><br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> I recently watched the opera <em>Doctor Atomic</em> , where one character is Oppenheimer&#39;s Native American maid. That&#39;s the kind of voice you don&#39;t hear in the movie.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> It was certainly a valid perspective. These guys came in and swept the mesa clean, and they used the Native American people to clean their houses.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Nolan is so focused on Oppenheimer—but with a movie like this, you have to find, as you&#39;ve said, the clothesline.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> And there was so much drama on the industrial side that&#39;s basically just left out. It&#39;s compressed into something that is really very brilliant—those big open jars in which they keep dropping marbles [to track the supply of uranium and plutonium]. That&#39;s as close as we come to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/05/the-60-year-downfall-of-nuclear-power-in-the-us-has-left-a-huge-mess/560945/">seeing the Hanford complex</a> , with its huge production reactors, or the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-was-once-the-worlds-largest-building-has-now-been-completely-demolished/282549/">Oak Ridge complex</a> , with one factory that was [about] a mile long, so the supervisors inside rode around on bicycles.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> How do you feel about the impact this movie will have on how a mass audience understands this immensely complicated story?<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> I&#39;ve been living with this story now for 40, 50 years. So what I&#39;m most excited by—you will consider this crass, but this is where I am in my life—is we&#39;ve got an option from a German company for <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> to be made into a multipart television series. And I&#39;m just hoping that this will cause enough stir that these people will finally, for the first time in all these years, actually pick up the option. That would be just wonderful, and I&#39;d pay off my mortgage, and my version of the story would be out there.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 13:11:08 GMT</pubDate><guid

data-event-element="inline link"

not in the way I ever expected <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/UaKvvXLev5fJVgs_06gkUS2D5Po=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/soccer_/original.jpg" alt="1991 年世界杯后足球运动员庆祝的照片。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Tommy Cheng / AFP / Getty</figcaption></figure> When I started playing soccer, it felt like I&#39;d joined a secret club. At age 7, I signed up for a boys&#39; team; the first girls&#39; league didn&#39;t arrive in my New Jersey town until the following year. In the 1980s, the sport was just taking off in the United States. As I grew older and many of the girls on my youth teams stopped playing, I drew closer to the small group that had stuck with the sport. We wore Umbro shorts and Adidas Samba sneakers and jewelry adorned with soccer balls to clearly demarcate our tribe.<br><br> By high school, I was all-in. I lived for games under the Wednesday-night lights, where I might receive the ball at the perfect moment with the green expanse of the field before me, knowing that with two quick touches and a burst of speed, maybe, just maybe, I could break away and find myself alone, facing the goalkeeper illuminated against the black sky. In the winter, we played indoors. But the only game during the indoor season I can really remember happened some 7,000 miles away in China.<br><br> Sitting in the players&#39; box ahead of my own game, I stared at the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/sports/1991/12/01/us-women-capture-world-soccer-title/7a08cd3f-531f-47a8-889d-07527382f698/">story</a> clipped from <i>The Washington Post</i> : “US Women Capture World Soccer Title.” It wasn&#39;t even the top headline in the sports section that day, and the only photo ran inside, showing the winning goal—no photo of Brandi Chastain on her knees, clutching her jersey in a warrior prayer to the soccer gods; no elated Alex Morgan piggybacking a Megan Rapinoe in her signature victory stance. It&#39;s hard to fathom now.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-2023-nwsl-megan-rapinoe-alyssa-thompson/674816/">Read: The two players who tell the story of US women&#39;s soccer</a><br><br> The player I most admired wasn&#39;t mentioned. In just two years, Mia Hamm had gone from playing on the Virginia state-championship-winning team in high school to starring at the University of North Carolina and then to winning the first-ever Women&#39;s World Cup. I was 15 at the time, and living in Northern Virginia. Hamm was 19, mathematical proof that soccer could lead somewhere. I took to the field that day confident that a girl playing soccer was no longer something novel or strange, an eccentricity to be tolerated by reproachful aunts, uncles, and high-school counselors.<br><br> What I hadn&#39;t quite grasped was that the small tribe of ponytailed players with soccer-ball necklaces and folded newspaper clippings was about to give way to an army of girls. Today, in any midsize town in America, a school-age girl can choose between a recreational team or a club team, and, in many cases, among competing teams in those categories. When I started playing high-school soccer in 1989, slightly more than 100,000 girls were playing at that level. Over the next three decades, the number nearly quadrupled.<br><br> Hamm and other stars, including Julie Foudy, Michelle Akers, and Kristine Lilly, built on the triumph of that first World Cup. Their efforts and those of the women who followed behind them helped to create a flourishing US women&#39;s professional league, to secure pay equity, and to construct a pipeline of talented young players. The women&#39;s national team has mounted the champions&#39; stand at half of the World Cup tournaments to date. But just as I once watched girls&#39; soccer spread through the United States, the US women are watching it spread through the world.<br><br> In 2019, FIFA estimated that 13 million girls and women were playing organized soccer worldwide. The first Women&#39;s World Cup, in 1991, had only 12 contenders. Since then, FIFA has steadily increased the pool. Today, the Women&#39;s World Cup includes 32 nations, the same number of countries that vie for the men&#39;s title. It&#39;s no longer just perennially strong teams such as Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands, and England that the US has to fight off, but also Spain, France, Brazil, Canada, Australia, and others. These programs aren&#39;t growing; they&#39;re fully grown. And the larger pool includes nations competing for the first time on this global stage, including Haiti, Morocco, Panama, the Philippines, Portugal, the Republic of Ireland, Vietnam, and Zambia. Nearly every columnist writing on the 2023 World Cup has observed that the US team will have to work much harder to win this go-round.<br><br> I was 17 when I realized my dreams of soccer glory were over. It started with a skiing accident. I remember the bindings not releasing, my friend&#39;s dad rushing me home early, the doctor hinging the bottom part of my leg open like a cabinet door, the surgery, the wheelchair. But in my teenage brain, none of it quite clicked until the moment I rolled into the high-school cafeteria for the team meeting and was greeted by our new head coach. “Please tell me you&#39;re not Claudine,” he said.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-soccer/674802/">Read: The women&#39;s world cup is about more than soccer</a><br><br> Now I watch soccer from the sidelines, or on the screen, cheering for the US women. It&#39;s not my secret little club anymore—millions of fans do the same—and I&#39;ve made my peace with that. I&#39;m thrilled to see new generations of players take the field, players who have grown up never doubting the possibility of competing on the world stage. And I like to imagine that the players on the US women&#39;s team feel the same way, as they&#39;ve watched the women&#39;s game spread around the world. There&#39;s glory in being the best, but there&#39;s glory too in paving the way for others.<br><br> During the 2019 World Cup finals, as Rose Lavelle took the shot that solidified a 2–0 victory over the Netherlands, I wasn&#39;t watching the screen. Instead, I was looking at my daughter. The elation and admiration on her face seemed like a three-decade-old reflection of what I had once felt. She was watching the US women clinch the World Cup, knowing that the whole world was watching too. And she doesn&#39;t pay homage to her sport by clipping newspaper stories; she frames magazine covers showing the champions.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:30:00

href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/07/20/false-claim-amc-shut-off-ac-for-sound-of-freedom-fact-check/70431071007/">声称存在旨在阻止他们观看这部电影的破坏事件</a>。本周， <i>《自由之声》的</i>收入突破了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/23/sound-of-freedom-qanon-movie-conspiracy-theories">1 亿美元</a>。上周，前总统唐纳德·特朗普在新泽西州的高尔夫俱乐部举行了一场放映活动，他借用帕丽斯·希尔顿的话说，这部电影是“世界上最热门的电影”。周二晚上，众议院议长凯文·麦卡锡为国会议员放映了这部电影。<br><br>这部电影的批评者认为，这部电影夸大了儿童剥削的普遍性，从而有助于推进<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">匿名者Q的阴谋论</a>，即撒旦统治精英猥亵儿童并以他们的鲜血为食。但电影的粉丝说，<i>这是民主党精英不想让你看的电影！</i><br><br> <i>《自由之声》</i>两者都不是。还好——不算太好，但也不算太糟糕。它没有提及“深层政府”的吸血或国会性阴谋。这是一部简单但乏味的动作片，讲述了一个男人追求正义的故事——角色发展为零，有太多的人哭泣或抽雪茄的特写镜头。<br><br>尽管这部电影没有描绘任何特别生动的内容，但虐待儿童的主题仍然很难在大银幕上戏剧化地观看。这令人心烦意乱。但后来与其他观众谈论这件事时也是如此，他们中的许多人似乎相信他们的一些同胞纵容贩卖儿童。换句话说， <i>《自由之声》</i>只是一场看似无休无止的文化战争的最新导火索，这场文化战争鼓励美国人相信彼此最坏的一面。<br><br>在电影中，巴拉德由吉姆·卡维泽饰演，他也在 2004 年的<i>《耶稣受难记</i>》中饰演耶稣，他自己也涉足了<i>Q</i>的黑暗奇思妙想。2021 年，他在俄克拉荷马州的一次右翼会议上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/07/sound-of-freedom-qanon-theories-jim-caviezel/">发表讲话</a>，他在会上警告与会者“儿童的肾上腺素红”，这是一个荒谬的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-qanon-became-obsessed-with-adrenochrome-an-imaginary-drug-hollywood-is-harvesting-from-kids">理论</a>，称全球精英正在使用从被绑架的儿童身上提取的化学物质来让他们看起来精神抖擞。电影中的某一时刻，当被问到为什么他如此坚定地要拯救孩子们时，卡维泽的角色停了下来，他的眼睛里充满了泪水。 “上帝的孩子是不卖的，”他说。我的剧院爆发出掌声和“阿门！”的呼喊声。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">摘自2020年6月号：Q的预言</a><br><br>这部电影团结了宗教保守派和特朗普的支持者，以及一小部分长期偏执的人——或者至少在我的放映中似乎是这样。 （我选择这个特定的剧院是因为，当我在网上查看时，很多人都买了票——可能是因为麦克莱恩比华盛顿特区的许多其他地方拥有更多的右倾选民。）<br><br>凯特·考克斯 (Kate Cox) 是一位来自麦克莱恩 (McLean) 的退休人员，戴着小花朵耳环，她在电影开始前告诉我，她是“反堕胎天主教徒”，担心边境问题。 “这正是这件事的意义所在，”她说。 “他们正在把这些人卖为性奴隶。”考克斯和她的女朋友们还担心从墨西哥运来的芬太尼：<i>建一堵墙有多难？</i><br><br> “还有无家可归的人！”考克斯的朋友佩吉拒绝透露自己的姓氏，她补充道。 “城市正在分崩离析。”考克斯点点头。 “不管你对特朗普有什么看法，99%都是真的，”她说，“但这在特朗普统治下并没有发生。”<br><br>与拥有巨额营销预算和企业合作伙伴关系的<i>芭比娃娃</i>不同，口碑似乎是<i>自由之声的</i>主要上座驱动力：周日与我交谈的大多数人都是在亲人的推荐下购买了门票。<br><br> “我的一个朋友告诉我看这部电影，”居住在华盛顿的瑞士人妮可·古铁雷斯 (Nicole Gutierrez) 告诉我。 “这是一个比我们想象的更大的业务。好莱坞、政客——他们都参与其中。”她拿出手机给我看她朋友几分钟前发的一条短信。 “也许你知道这意味着什么。”她的朋友发送了字母<i>C</i> ，然后是眼睛表情符号，最后是字母<i>A</i> 。 “我认为他指的是中央情报局，”我说。古铁雷斯扬起了眉毛。 “每个人都参与其中，”她说。 “当然是白宫。”<br><br>在片尾字幕后的奖励片段中，卡维泽用小声鼓励观众扫描二维码，为买不起票的人买票。 “我们可以让<i>《自由之声》</i>成为 21 世纪奴隶制的<i>汤姆叔叔的小屋</i>，”他说，并将这部电影比作激发 19 世纪废奴运动的小说。之后，当灯光亮起时，我这一排一位自称切斯卡的女士站起来，宣布她来这里是为了谈论她失踪一年半的 23 岁女儿。 “我期待奇迹的出现，”她说。 “她很快就会回来。”切斯卡警告我们末日即将来临，并要求我们为她和彼此祈祷。有几个人再次说：“阿门”，至少有一个女人拥抱了她。<br><br>当我离开剧院时，我走近另一群朋友，听听他们的想法。他们都拒绝透露自己的姓氏，但很高兴告诉我他们发现这部电影有多么强大。 “男人想要保护别人，”一位名叫乔治的黑发中年男子说道，“所以有人会对孩子做出这样的事情，这真是令人尴尬。”他提出了杰森·阿尔丁的新歌《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-streams-up-controversy-1235543896/">在小镇尝试</a>》，乡村艺术家在歌曲中承诺为治安维持正义。 “我喜欢那首没人愿意谈论的歌曲，”乔治说。真正的男人会殴打虐待儿童的人。<br><br> “你意识到你正在和该地区少数几个保守派人士交谈吗？”乔治的大胡子朋友史蒂文眨了眨眼睛问我。 “你知道让我惊讶的是，”他继续说道，“这就是左派讨厌这部电影的原因。我不明白。”他看着我，好像在等待答案。<br><br>如果左翼人士对这部电影感到排斥，那么右翼人士也出于同样的原因觉得有必要看这部电影。我们的政治领导人、我们的社交圈和我们选择的媒体已经在我们的回声室中准确地表明了我们应该如何看待它——除此之外，还有很多其他的事情。 <a data-event-element="inline

Person]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>日常疲劳与长期感染新冠肺炎和 ME/CFS 的人所经历的疲惫症状完全不同。 <br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>玛丽亚·梅德姆</figcaption></figure>亚历克西斯·米斯科 (Alexis Misko) 的健康状况已经有了很大改善，每月一次，她可以离开家几个小时。首先，她需要在黑暗的房间里躺上两天的大部分时间来增强能量，除了听有声读物之外什么也做不了。然后她需要一个司机、一个可以让她躺下的安静目的地，以及随后几天的休息时间来恢复。她告诉我，短暂的户外快乐“永远都感觉不够”，但这比她在长期感染新冠病毒的第一年所承受的要多得多，当时她无法坐直超过一个小时或站立超过 10 分钟。现在，至少，她可以在洗澡的同一天看电视。<br><br>前世，她在研究生院熬夜，在医院担任职业治疗师，辛苦轮班。她进行长距离跑步，并在长途飞行后下垂。这一切都无法与她自三年前感染 COVID-19 以来所经历的一切相比。她在一封电子邮件中告诉我，她现在感受到的疲劳“就像你的本质和你的生命力完全耗尽”。<br><br>疲劳是新冠肺炎长期症状中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext#seccesectitle0027">最</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2805540">常见</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/6/e069217">最</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9383197/">严重的</a>症状之一，也是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://batemanhornecenter.org/education/me-cfs/">肌痛性脑脊髓炎</a>（也称为慢性疲劳综合症或 ME/CFS）等类似慢性疾病的特征。但在这些疾病中，疲劳与日常疲倦截然不同，以至于与我交谈过的大多数人都没有预料到疲劳的严重性、多方面性和持久性。<br><br>首先，这种疲劳并不是一个单一的症状；而是一种症状。它<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852700/">有很多面孔</a>。它会让身体变得沉重：丽莎·盖斯勒将其比作“在一个重力极高的星球上穿着铅外骨骼，同时患有严重的关节炎”。它可以使身体加速：许多疲劳的人感到“疲惫不堪”，尽管已经完全精疲力竭，但矛盾的是，他们处于“战斗或逃跑”模式。它可能是认知性的：思想变得迟缓、语无伦次，有时甚至令人痛苦——就像“我的额叶里卡着钢丝绒”，ME 的文学历史学家格温·杜雅尔丁 (Gwynn Dujardin) 告诉我。<br><br>米斯科说，疲劳将最平凡的任务变成了“痛苦的成本效益分析”。如果您洗衣服，您需要休息多长时间才能做饭？如果你喝了水，你能去厕所吗？只有四分之一的长途运输者出现<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm">严重限制其日常活动的</a>症状，但即使是那些患有“中度”病例的人也受到严重限制。斯克里普斯研究中心的项目主管朱莉娅·摩尔·沃格尔仍在工作，但她告诉我，洗头会让她像以前长跑一样疲惫不堪。<br><br>虽然正常的疲劳是暂时的并且可以自行调节——即使在跑完马拉松之后，你也可以自己洗个澡，睡觉后你会感觉更好——但休息通常无法治愈长期新冠肺炎或 ME/CFS 带来的疲劳。 “我醒来时感到很疲惫，”长期感染新冠病毒的莱蒂西亚·苏亚雷斯告诉我。<br><br>由于长期患有新冠肺炎、ME/CFS 和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chronicillnessinclusion.org.uk/2021/04/28/what-are-energy-impairment-and-elci/">其他限制能量的慢性疾病</a>，仅在美国就有数百万人经历着令人衰弱的疲劳。但美国社会倾向于将无所作为等同于不道德，将生产力等同于价值。面对一种根本不允许人们活动的情况——即使是一种可以测量和解释的缺陷——许多医生和亲人默认不相信。当苏亚雷斯告诉别人她的病时，他们通常会说：“哦，是的，我也累了。”当她卧床数天时，人们告诉她，“我需要这样的周末。”苏亚雷斯的问题是非常现实的，尽管研究人员已经开始弄清楚为什么这么多像她这样的人正在遭受痛苦，但他们还不知道如何阻止它。<br><br>疲劳会产生一种残疾的背景嗡嗡声，但它可能会被更严重的撞击事件所打断，这些事件甚至会剥夺长途运输者通常拥有的少量能量。<br><br>达莉亚·奥勒 (Daria Oller) 是一名物理治疗师和运动教练，因此当她在 2020 年 3 月感染新冠病毒时，她很自然地尝试通过锻炼来改善健康。她不明白为什么在短短的跑步之后，她的疲劳、脑雾、胸痛和其他症状就会急剧加剧，以至于她几乎无法动弹或说话。这些事故与她在训练中学到的一切相矛盾。在与 ME/CFS 的物理治疗师交谈后，她才意识到这种现象有一个名字：<em>劳累后不适</em>。<br><br><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Post-exertional_malaise">劳累后不适</a>(PEM) 是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(21)00513-9/fulltext#secsectitle0030">ME/CFS 的典型特征</a>，也是长期新冠肺炎 (COVID-19) 的共同特征。它通常被描述为一种极端形式的疲劳，但更正确的理解是，它是一种生理状态，在这种状态下，<em>所有</em>现有症状都会更加剧烈地燃烧，并且会引发新的症状。除了疲劳之外，患有 PEM 的人还可能会感到剧烈的放射痛、炎症烧灼感或胃肠道和认知问题：“你会感到中毒、流感样、脑震荡，”米斯科说。疲劳通常在劳累后立即出现，而 PEM 可能会在数小时或数天后出现，而且严重程度不成比例。即使是轻微的体力或脑力劳动也可能会让人们疲惫数天、数周、数月。看医生可能会导致车祸，填写残疾福利申请或感知明亮的灯光和响亮的声音、在炎热的天气里调节体温或应对压力也可能会导致事故。如果您在疲劳时感觉电池电量耗尽，那么在 PEM 中它们就会完全消失。这是可能性的毁灭：大多数人只能在噩梦中经历无法动弹的绝望，杜雅尔丹告诉我。 “PEM 就是这样，但更痛苦。”<br><br>医疗专业人员在培训期间通常不会了解 PEM。许多人怀疑它的存在，因为它与健康人所忍受的任何东西都非常不同。玛丽·迪莫克告诉我，只有当她看到患有 ME/CFS 的儿子马修在她眼前崩溃时，她才明白这意味着什么。 “他简直<em>融化了</em>，”迪莫克说。但大多数人从来没有看到过这样的损害，因为 PEM 将那些处于其中的人隐藏起来，不让公众看到。而且由于它通常会在延迟后发生，经历过 PEM 的人可能会在朋友和同事眼中表现良好，而他们随后不会看到他们后来付出的高昂代价。<br><br>这个价格既真实又可衡量。在心肺运动测试（CPET）中，患者使用跑步机或健身自行车，而医生则记录他们的耗氧量、血压和心率。伊萨卡学院的运动生理学家贝特西·凯勒告诉我，如果一天后重新测试，大多数人都可以重复他们的表现，即使他们患有心脏病或因缺乏活动而身体状况不佳。获得 PEM 的人不能。<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4004422/">第二次的结果是如此不同，以至于</a>当凯勒在 2003 年第一次对某人进行 ME/CFS 测试时，“我告诉我的同事，我们的设备没有校准，”她说。但她和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor203170">其他人</a>在数百名 ME/CFS 和长期感染新冠病毒的患者身上发现了同样的模式——“无法用任何心理学解释的客观结果，”布莱根妇女医院的肺科医生 David Systrom 告诉我。 “许多患者被告知这一切都在他们的脑海中，但这确实掩盖了这一点。”尽管如此，许多保险公司拒绝支付第二次检查的费用，而且许多患者无法在不严重危及健康的情况下进行两次（甚至一次）CPET。 “20 年后，我仍然有医生反驳和忽视客观数据，”凯勒说。 （一些长期的新冠肺炎研究<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M22-1492">完全忽略了 PEM</a> ，或者将其与疲劳捆绑在一起。）<br><br>奥勒认为，这种忽视的出现是因为 PEM 颠覆了运动有益的教条——对于大多数其他疾病来说，这句格言是正确的。 “改变你整个职业生涯所做的事情并不容易，即使我告诉某人他们可能会伤害病人，”她说。事实上，许多长途运输者的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/9/5093">情况变得更糟</a>，因为他们在生病的最初几周<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0264331">没有得到足够的休息</a>，或者试图按照医生的指示进行锻炼来缓解症状。<br><br> PEM 患者也经常被误诊。他们被告知，由于久坐不动，他们的身体状况不佳，而他们的不活动是频繁发生车祸的结果，而不是原因。他们被告知，当他们通常拼命想要移动但要么身体无法移动，要么使用约束来避免撞车时，他们会感到沮丧和没有动力。奥勒是一个由 1,500 名患有长期新冠肺炎的耐力运动员组成的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidsupportforenduranceathletes/">支持小组</a>的一员，他们非常习惯在疼痛和疲劳中跑步、游泳和骑自行车。 “为什么我们都要<em>停下来</em>？”她问。<br><br>一些患有能量限制性疾病的患者认为，他们的疾病名称和症状使他们更容易被抹黑。<em>疲劳</em>会促使人们尽量减少日常疲劳等严重消耗。<em>慢性疲劳综合症</em>将广泛的致残状况分解为容易被忽视的单一症状。这些抱怨是有道理的，但问题比任何名字都更深刻。<br><br>杜雅尔丁（Dujardin）这位英国教授正在（非常缓慢地）撰写一部疲劳文化史，他认为我们对疲劳的概念已经被几个世纪的还原论所削弱。随着医学研究慢慢分裂成解剖学专业，它失去了对人体能量贡献系统的总体认识，或者说它的缺失。能量的概念曾经是（现在仍然是）万物有灵论哲学的核心，虽然也曾经是西方世界的核心，但现在它在文化上与庸医和伪科学联系在一起。杜雅尔丁说：“美国的每个收银机上都有小瓶‘能量增强剂’。”但当美国国立卫生研究院 (NIH) 于 2021 年召开<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/about/events/beyond-symptom-biology-fatigue">疲劳生物学</a>会议时，“专家们不断观察到，疲劳没有标准定义，每个人都对人类能量有不同的看法。”这些术语已经变得如此不具体，毫无帮助，以至于我们的“疲劳”概念可以涵盖多种状态，包括 PEM 和闲置，并且可能受到社会力量的严重影响，尤其是利用他人能量的愿望。<br><br>正如历史学家艾米丽·K·阿贝尔 (Emily K.

Damaged mitochondria, destructive ROS, inefficient metabolism, and chronic inflammation all compound one another in a vicious cycle that, if it becomes sufficiently intense, could manifest as a PEM crash. “No one is absolutely certain about what causes PEM,” Seltzer told me, but it makes sense that “you have this big metabolic shift and your nervous system can&#39;t get back on an even keel.” And if people push through, deepening the metabolic demands on a body that already can&#39;t meet them, the cycle can spin even faster, “leading to progressive disability,” Putrino said.<br><br> Other factors might also be at play. Compared with healthy people, those with long COVID and ME/CFS have differences in the size, structure, or function of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00051-2/fulltext">brain</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032274/">regions</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2018/12/12/death-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-me-cfs-autopsy-files/">including</a> the thalamus, which relays motor signals and regulates consciousness, and the basal ganglia, which controls movement and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21386#:~:text=Hence%2C%20dysfunctions%20of%20the%20basal,thalamic%E2%80%93frontal%20cortical%20system8.">has been implicated in fatigue</a> . Long-haulers also have problems with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8938726/">blood vessels</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34087216/">red blood cells</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02286-7">clotting</a> , all of which might further staunch their flows of blood, oxygen, and nutrients. “I&#39;ve tested so many of these people over the years, and we see over and over again that when the systems start to fail, they all fail in the same way,” Keller said. Together, these woes explain why long COVID and ME/CFS have such bewilderingly varied symptoms. That diversity fuels disbelief— <em>how</em> <em>could one disease cause all of this</em> ?—but it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect if things as fundamental as metabolism go awry.<br><br> Long-haulers might not know the biochemical specifics of their symptoms, but they are uncannily good at capturing those underpinnings through metaphor. People experiencing autonomic blood-flow problems might complain about feeling “drained,” and that&#39;s literally happening: In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30">POTS</a> , a form of dysautonomia, blood pools in the lower body when people stand. People experiencing metabolic problems often use dead-battery analogies, and indeed their cellular batteries—the mitochondria—are being damaged: “It really feels like something is going wrong at the cellular level,” Oller told me. Attentive doctors can find important clues about the basis of their patients&#39; illness hiding amid descriptions that are often billed as “exaggerated or melodramatic,” Dujardin said.<br><br> Some COVID long-haulers do recover. But several studies have found that, so far, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4505315">most don&#39;t</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29513-z">fully return</a> to their previous baseline, and many who become severely ill stay that way. This pool of persistently sick people is now mired in the same neglect that has long plagued those who suffer from illnesses such as ME/CFS. Research into such conditions are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32568148/">grossly underfunded</a> , so no cures exist. Very few doctors in the US <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/mecfs-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-doctors-long-covid/671518/">know how to treat these conditions</a> , and many are nearing retirement, so patients struggle to find care. Long-COVID clinics exist but vary in quality: Some know nothing about other energy-limiting illnesses, and still prescribe potentially harmful and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/25/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-cdc/">officially discouraged treatments</a> such as exercise. Clinicians who better understand these illnesses know that caution is crucial. When Putrino works with long-haulers to recondition their autonomic nervous system, he always starts as gently as possible to avoid triggering PEM. Such work “isn&#39;t easy and isn&#39;t fast,” he said, and it usually means stabilizing people instead of curing them.<br><br> Stability can be life-changing, especially when it involves changes that patients can keep up at home. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432282/">Over-the-counter supplements</a> such as coenzyme Q10, which is used by mitochondria to generate energy and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20010505/">is depleted in ME/CFS patients</a> , can <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25386668/">reduce fatigue</a> . Anti-inflammatory medications such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Low_dose_naltrexone">low-dose naltrexone</a> may have some promise. Sleep hygiene may not cure fatigue, but certainly makes it less debilitating. Dietary changes can help, but the right ones might be counterintuitive: High-fiber foods take more energy to digest, and some long-haulers get PEM episodes after eating meals that <em>seem</em> healthy. And the most important part of this portfolio is “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Pacing#The_principles_of_pacing">pacing</a> ”—a strategy for carefully keeping your activity levels beneath the threshold that causes debilitating crashes.<br><br> Pacing is more challenging than it sounds. Practitioners can&#39;t rely on fixed routines; instead, they must learn to gauge their fluctuating energy levels in real time, while becoming acutely aware of their PEM triggers. Some turn to wearable technology such as heart-rate monitors, and more than 30,000 are testing a patient-designed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.makevisible.com/blog/why-we-are-building-visible">app called Visible</a> to help spot patterns in their illness. Such data are useful, but the difference between rest and PEM might be just 10 or 20 extra heartbeats a minute—a narrow crevice into which long-haulers must squeeze their life. Doing so can be frustrating, because pacing isn&#39;t a recovery tactic; it&#39;s mostly a way of not getting worse, which makes its value harder to appreciate. Its physical benefits come at mental costs: Walks, workouts, socializing, and “all the things I&#39;d do for mental health before were huge energy sinks,” Vogel told me. And without financial stability or social support, many long-haulers must work, parent, and care for themselves even knowing that they&#39;ll suffer later. “It&#39;s impossible not to overdo it, because life is life,” Vogel said.<br><br> “Our society is not set up for pacing,” Oller added. Long-haulers must resist the enormous cultural pressure to prove their worth by pushing as hard as they can. They must tolerate being chastised for trying to avert a crash, and being disbelieved if they fail. “One of the most insulting things people can say is &#39;Fight your illness,&#39;” Misko said. That would be much easier for her. “It takes so much self-control and strength to do less, to be less, to shrink your life down to one or two small things from which you try to extract joy in order to survive.” For her and many others, rest has become both a medical necessity and a radical act of defiance—one that, in itself, is exhausting.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/chronic-fatigue-long-covid-symptoms/674834/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/chronic-fatigue-long-covid-symptoms/674834/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Have Your Most Fulfilling Vacation Ever]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Turning your leisure into learning offers the happiest holiday experience of all. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/bcQIe3ApyXDk9VlAjnYVwowq3RA=/0x0:3000x1688/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/HowToBuildALife147/original.jpg" alt="一个人一边骑冲浪板一边读书的插图。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Jan Buchczik</figcaption></figure> <i data-stringify-type="italic">Want to stay current with Arthur&#39;s writing? <a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/how-to-build-a-life/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/how-to-build-a-life/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up</a> to get an email every time a new column comes out.</i><br><br> L <span class="smallcaps">ooking for a</span> good vacation this year? You might choose from a number of models. For example, Instagram Adventure, in which you pick an exotic destination, pack as much as you can into every day, take a million pictures, and document everything on social media to advertise that you are as energetic in leisure as you are at work. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Couch Potato, which means that you fritter away the entire two weeks doing very little. Other popular options include Two Endless Weeks in My Childhood Bedroom (for 20-somethings) and A Whole Month&#39;s Pay Shot at Disney Because the Kids Whined All Year (for 30-somethings).<br><br> One great vacation model, which harks back to the ancients, is frequently overlooked. The word for “leisure” in Greek is σχολή, or <i>skhole</i> . In Latin, the word is <i>schola</i> —from which we get “school.” In other words, the name for the place where we teach and learn derives from the word for “leisure.” One way to interpret this is that education is a recreational activity (a concept that may strike my hardworking students as counterintuitive). But a better explanation comes from the 20th-century philosopher Josef Pieper, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Leisure.html?id=VKbcnmvM7N8C&amp;source=kp_book_description">believed</a> that leisure is the circumstance in which we can learn the most, if we understand and use it properly.<br><br> If the conventional vacation models are leaving you cold, Pieper&#39;s insight could provide the holiday you&#39;ve been looking for. This year, consider using your time off as an opportunity to learn something wonderful.<br><br> P <span class="smallcaps">eople pursue</span> different objectives in their vacations, but no one I have ever met was seeking <i>lower</i> levels of positive emotion. The point is to be happier than usual, which is why a bad vacation is so frustrating—it feels like a missed opportunity to reset and make some emotional progress.<br><br> To get the most contentment from your vacation, it is worthwhile to start with an understanding of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00781/full#:~:text=Robert%20Plutchik%20proposed%20eight%20primary,them%20in%20a%20color%20wheel.">basic</a> human emotions. The negative side includes anger, sadness, fear, and disgust, which alert us to threats and stimulate behaviors such as fight or flight to keep us safe. These are obviously not the emotions you are hoping to experience on vacation—though all bets are off if a long car ride with the kids is involved.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/07/pre-vacation-time-off-work-pressure/670939/">Read: Why must we work so hard before vacation?</a><br><br> An abundance of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122271/">basic positive emotions</a> such as joy, surprise, and anticipation are what you seek. But you shouldn&#39;t neglect another positive emotion of special importance: interest—the feeling of curiosity or fascination that captures your attention.<br><br> The experience of interest is favored by evolution: It comes from learning new things, which rewarded our ancestors with more food and a greater chance at survival and reproduction. The same tendency for your Pleistocene hominin forebear to feel satisfaction after devising a novel way to catch a small animal persists in us today when we first master riding a bike or succeed in making a presentable soufflé.<br><br> The well-being effect from learning is not as straightforward as it is for other activities, such as eating a doughnut. In fact, it involves a bit of sacrifice. As scholars <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-009-9166-1">found</a> in 2011, investing in an activity to raise competency can lower your moment-to-moment happiness but can boost well-being measured over a longer time frame of hours and days. This makes perfect sense, of course: You rack your brain <i>learning</i> calculus but then bask in <i>knowing</i> it. In that respect, learning is like exercise: sometimes painful in the moment but rewarding overall.<br><br> A key to maximizing satisfaction through learning is intrinsic motivation, or what the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (who famously wrote about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cgu.edu/people/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/">“flow states”</a> ) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9094-9_7">called</a> “autotelic learning”: learning for its own sake. Neuroscientists in 2014 used fMRI technology to show that this type of learning has to do with the brain&#39;s response to curiosity. They <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(14)00804-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627314008046%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">demonstrated</a> high levels of activity in the midbrain and a structure known as the nucleus accumbens, which indicated an enhanced release of dopamine, when study participants were highly curious about a subject. In other words, satisfying your curiosity through learning about whatever you&#39;re most interested in will give you a neurochemical payoff.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C. Brooks?

You might be tempted to extrapolate from this evidence to predict, for example, that if everybody went to college, we would have a happier society. Not so fast: One 2017 study <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-017-9504-0">suggests</a> that whether higher education drives happiness up or down depends on, among other things, where you live. In nations without high levels of education, many of which are considered developing countries, university education is associated with higher happiness. In countries with labor markets saturated with educated individuals, which is characteristic of greater economic development, the effect is reversed—university attendance is associated with lower happiness. One possible explanation is that for the former group, university training offers a path out of poverty, but for the latter group much of this effect has long since been depleted. Alternatively, something about the rich-world college experience may contribute to lower well-being. Suffice to say that the sort of leisure learning the Greeks had in mind is not identical with the modern American college experience.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">aken together</span> , the research points to a clear strategy to build a great vacation: Identify something you are very interested in for its own sake and focus on it intensively. And because the task or skill should be challenging enough to increase competence, the satisfaction goal should be understood in hours and days, not in the moment to moment of learning.<br><br> You can choose a range of ways to achieve this outcome, whether cheap and casual or expensive and formal. At one end of the scale, you can simply program your own reading curriculum. Over two weeks, you might set about carefully reading four books on a particular topic. Or you might decide to read the entire Bible or Quran. You might also mix your media: reading a biography of JS Bach, for instance, while listening to 50 of his cantatas.<br><br> At a more formal level, you might dedicate your vacation to taking a class. Perhaps you want to learn how to cook Punjabi cuisine, or follow one of the many “massive open online classes” (MOOCs, for short) that are available for free, such as—random example—one about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.edx.org/course/managing-happiness">exploring the science of happiness</a> . For a more intensive (and expensive) option, you might hire a teacher to give you a head start on playing the guitar or speaking Mandarin, and do that for several hours every day. Or hire a nutrition-and-fitness coach. You will be amazed at how much progress you can make in two weeks.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/04/covid-workcation-remote-work-life-balance/629605/">Read: &#39;Workcations&#39; aren&#39;t an escape. They&#39;re practice.</a><br><br> At the most rigorous level, you might go all in and spend your vacation on a guided silent retreat in one spiritual tradition or another. Or perhaps you could make a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/09/happiness-walking-pilgrimage/620075/">pilgrimage</a> , walking in contemplation without devices or interruptions, and immersing yourself during rest periods in a wisdom literature that complements the experience.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">na famous passage</span> of <i>The Republic</i> , Plato <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D7&amp;force=y">advises</a> on how to educate children in a way that will bring out their best: “Do not … keep children to their studies by compulsion but by play. That will … better enable you to discern the natural capacities of each.” In other words, kids will learn better if you allow them to enjoy recreation in a constructive way, rather than forcing them to study, which is more likely to stimulate rebellion.<br><br> A similar principle lies behind the best model of vacation. Feeling compelled to relax and have fun is a common and counterproductive mistake. Telling yourself “I <i>will</i> be refreshed and not think about work!” is bound to lead in the wrong direction. Instead, employ a Platonic strategy and turn your leisure into learning. You might just have your best holiday ever.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/vacation-learning-leisure-happiness/674743/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/vacation-learning-leisure-happiness/674743/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[UFOs Are Officially Mainstream]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Even Congress is getting in on the hype. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/iSFnfYB__qRzlZQr4vEPE3xA4sU=/0x0:4999x2812/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_1556767197_copy/original.jpg" alt="前军事情报官员大卫·格鲁施在国会作证时的黑白照片" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Tom Williams / CQ-Roll Call / Getty</figcaption></figure> Earlier today, three witnesses came before Congress to testify about their experiences with unidentified flying objects. A former Navy pilot spoke of the mysterious objects that he has seen with his own eyes and through radar, and how frequently pilots encounter them in the air. A retired Navy commander described the time he pulled his jet up to a Tic Tac–shaped object hovering over the ocean, then watched it suddenly speed up and vanish.<br><br> The most anticipated remarks, however, came from a former military-intelligence officer named David Grusch, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/alien-intact-vehicles-ufo-us-government/674323/">went public with his account</a> just last month. Grusch told the House oversight subcommittee on national security that the American government has spent decades secretly recovering mysterious vehicles that have crashed on the ground, and has determined the material to be of “non-human” origin. The government also attempted to reverse engineer some of the technology, according to Grusch. And it&#39;s doing all of this clandestinely, without proper supervision by Congress.<br><br> In the hearing, Grusch expanded on his previous claims in response to lawmakers&#39; questions. If elected officials had never heard about this effort before, how did it get any funding? <em>The military pilfered money that had been allocated for its other programs</em> . A defense official recently testified before Congress that the US military hasn&#39;t found any evidence of extraterrestrial activity on Earth; is that statement correct? <em>It&#39;s not accurate.</em> Has any of the activity been aggressive or hostile? <em>My colleagues have gotten physically injured</em> . By UFOs, or by people within the government? <em>Both</em> .<br><br> After not holding a hearing on UFOs for more than half a century, Congress has recently held two in as many years. In that sense, we can count today&#39;s events as historic. But as in the other hearings, this one had no big reveal, no grand answer to humankind&#39;s most existential questions about our place in the universe. The hype surrounding the hearing—and there has been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/technology/2023/07/congress-ufo-hearings-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-real.html">considerable hype</a> —says more about the people who tuned in than about Grusch&#39;s claims. Just as it did in the late 1940s, when stories of flying saucers over Washington state and crash landings in New Mexico captivated the nation, UFO fever today indicates that Americans feel that their government knows more than it&#39;s letting on.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/alien-intact-vehicles-ufo-us-government/674323/">Read: Why everyone is suddenly talking about aliens</a><br><br> That sentiment is not new, nor is Americans&#39; belief in conspiracy theories. Though <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0270429">research suggests</a> that conspiracy thinking is not getting worse in the modern-day United States, we are in a moment of acute public curiosity about—and acceptance of—conspiracism. Compared with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">QAnon</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/microchipped-vaccines-15-minute-investigation/619081/">vaccine microchips</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/trump-voters-big-lie-stolen-election/629572/">stolen elections</a> , a big UFO cover-up might seem almost reasonable—even if that cover-up involves, as Grusch previously claimed in an interview, the military discovering the “dead pilots” of alien craft. (In Congress today, Grusch declined to give specifics about this and many other claims, saying that there was only so much he could disclose to the public and that he could elaborate in a closed setting.)<br><br> The past several years have coincided with an unprecedented mainstreaming of UFO culture. In 2017, when an interstellar object showed up in our solar system, most scientists agreed that it was an asteroid or a comet, but some said it could have been an alien spaceship. (The Harvard professor leading the latter camp, Avi Loeb, recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/science/avi-loeb-extraterrestrial-life.html">led an expedition</a> to the seafloor to recover material that he believes could be from alien spacecraft.) Later that year, <em>The New York Times</em> and other news outlets revealed that the Pentagon had a covert program dedicated to cataloging UFOs. Then NASA decided to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/06/nasa-ufo-uap-research-team/661229/">weigh in on the topic</a> after years of steering clear, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/nasa-ufos-conspiracy-theories/674259/">convened a team</a> to consider UFOs in a “scientific perspective.” And who can forget <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/02/unidentified-flying-objects-chinese-spy-balloon-american-alien-ufo-obsession/673068/">the spy balloons</a> that the military shot out of the sky this year?<br><br> These events have unfolded against a shift in public knowledge about the universe beyond Earth, which might help explain why people are interested. In the 1940s, the only planets we knew of were the ones around our sun, and scientists had only recently determined that there were galaxies other than our own. Today, astronomers have discovered more than 5,000 exoplanets, and telescopes can see nearly all the way back to the Big Bang. In the face of so many wonders, the question of whether we&#39;re sharing them with anyone else becomes more urgent, and might even seem more answerable. “I think people are just ready or at least excited about the possibilities of alien contact, maybe more than ever,” Jacob Haqq Misra, an astrobiologist at the Blue Marble Space Institute of Science, told me.<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/nasa-ufos-conspiracy-theories/674259/">Read: NASA learns the ugly truth about UFOs</a><br><br> Congress has contributed to this mainstreaming too. Under the instruction of lawmakers, the Pentagon last year established a special office dedicated to investigating reports of unexplainable phenomena in the sky, at sea, and on land. The effort has been unusually bipartisan, with both far-right Republicans and progressive Democrats calling on the military to be more transparent. This month, Senator Chuck Schumer <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/politics/ufo-records-schumer.html">introduced</a> legislation that would create a commission with the authority to declassify government documents about UFOs. “The American public has a right to learn about technologies of unknown origins, non-human intelligence, and unexplainable phenomena,” Schumer <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-rounds-introduce-new-legislation-to-declassify-government-records-related-to-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-and-ufos_modeled-after-jfk-assassination-records-collection-act--as-an-amendment-to-ndaa">said</a> in a statement.<br><br> Yes, we do. But <em>some undisclosed documents about UFOs</em> is not synonymous with <em>incontrovertible evidence that aliens have visited Earth</em> . UFOs are just that—objects that are flying, and that we cannot yet identify. If the military is misusing taxpayer money to investigate mysterious debris it doesn&#39;t recognize, that&#39;s bad, whether it&#39;s the remnants of drones from another nation or a non-human craft. “If that&#39;s the case, and auditors have not been allowed into these programs and there&#39;s illegal layers of secrecy,” Haqq Misra said, “then that&#39;s really important to disclose, independent of any connection to anything else”—anything otherworldly. But even as lawmakers assert that UFOs are primarily a national-security concern, by invoking aliens in their discussions, they lend credence to the idea that a connection between the two exists.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/05/congress-pentagon-ufo-hearing-aliens/629910/">Read: What the UFO discussion really needs</a><br><br> Grusch was careful to tell lawmakers that he was only “speaking to the facts as I have been told them”—that is, he has not seen any evidence of alien wreckage or its inhabitants himself. And in general, though his claims are steeped in the language of authority, he simply has not been able to offer any concrete proof. The news website that first published Grusch&#39;s claims reported that the Pentagon had cleared him to speak publicly, but that means only that his remarks don&#39;t contain classified information, not that they&#39;re true. Testifying under oath before Congress is not a measure of truth, either. Outside the hearing, some lawmakers<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/igorbobic/status/1684291248461426706">seemed</a> like they didn&#39;t know what to make of the claims.<br><br> The prospect of extraterrestrial interlopers may be a national-security question, but it&#39;s also a scientific one. Science requires data, and secondhand accounts just aren&#39;t data. “When NASA brings back rocks on the moon, those rocks are shared with qualified people,” David Spergel, an astrophysicist at Princeton who chaired NASA&#39;s committee on UFOs, told me. “Imagine we had some samples of some craft, [and] we really want to understand what it was. You would make materials from those small samples available for labs anywhere in the world.” In other words, meaningful testimony would <em>show</em> evidence of alien ships and pilots, not just tell the public about them. “That would be pretty awesome,” he said, but it&#39;s not what we&#39;ve got. Today, we heard some extraordinary claims, and, to quote Carl Sagan, they require extraordinary evidence.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 22:40:49 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/ufo-fever-congress-hearing-aliens/674835/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/ufo-fever-congress-hearing-aliens/674835/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[‘The Country’s Already Been Destroyed’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Israel&#39;s political crisis is about the sense that something deep, sacred to many, has broken. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/LuGeh9m3oBqWpAXEs9RFwzkS2r8=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/israel/original.jpg" alt="一名抗议者在举着以色列国旗的人群中举起火炬" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Ilia Yefimovich / AP</figcaption></figure> E <span class="smallcaps">ran Schwartz</span> looks like a fighter pilot. The 40-something appeared last week on the Israeli television show <em>Ofira and Berkowitz</em> —a black V-neck T-shirt over his trim, athletic chest; his black hair cut short—to defend his decision to end his service in the air-force reserves. “We&#39;re not the ones who tore up the social contract,” he said. “We swore to serve a state that is Jewish and democratic. And if Netanyahu is going to end Israel&#39;s being a liberal democracy, it&#39;s the country that violated the contract, not us.”<br><br> Member of the Knesset Matan Kahana, another pilot on the show, agreed with Schwartz that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was dragging the country to “the destruction of the Third Temple.” He insisted, though, that the pilots were wrong to end their service, “because that&#39;s Judgment Day weaponry.” And he warned of the consequences: “Refusal to serve will destroy the army; it will rip the country apart.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-limit-supreme-court-power-protests/674819/">Natan Sachs: Israel on the brink</a><br><br> “And the country isn&#39;t already being ripped apart?” Ofira Asayag, one of the hosts, shot back. “The country&#39;s already been destroyed.”<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n that one line,</span> Asayag captured precisely what millions of Israelis are feeling. The political crisis in Israel is no longer about being in favor of the judicial reform the Netanyahu government pledged to enact, or about opposing it. It is no longer about law; it is about the almost complete erosion of any trust millions of citizens have in the government. It is about the sense here that something deep, sacred to many, has broken, the feeling that, as Asayag put it, “the country&#39;s already been destroyed.”<br><br> Later in the show, she asked Schwartz the tough question his stand provokes: “If there&#39;s an emergency, if we&#39;re attacked, are you or are you not getting in a plane?” Schwartz dodged. Asayag saw him squirming, heard his voice cracking, stared him in the eye, and asked him a question Israelis hardly ever ask a fighter pilot: “Why are you crying?”<br><br> “I&#39;m not crying,” Schwartz replied.<br><br> But that wasn&#39;t entirely true, he acknowledged a moment later. “I&#39;m thinking of my grandfather,” he added. “He was one of the builders of this country … There was an unwritten contract between all of us, that we are all one people, and that we are at war here for one reason—to be secure in our own land. That is what Benjamin Netanyahu is destroying. He&#39;s leading us to the destruction of the Third Temple, and now my grandfather, with whom I can no longer speak—I have to explain to him that I&#39;m not serving this country? It&#39;s breaking me inside … My heart is broken.”<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">srael has become</span> a country of broken hearts, a nation of people paralyzed with disbelief that matters have come to this. Reservists, a crucial component of the fighting readiness of the Israel Defense Forces, have dropped out of voluntary service by the thousands, to the derision of some and the adulation of others. They served in air-force squadrons, cyberwarfare units, the medical corps, special-operations formations akin to the Navy SEALs—there is hardly an elite unit that has not been hit. Both Herzi Halevi, the IDF chief of staff, and Yoav Gallant, the defense minister—a member of Netanyahu&#39;s governing coalition—have been strikingly blunt in noting that the IDF&#39;s fighting capabilities may well have already been badly dented.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/benjamin-netanyahu-coalition-israel-democracy/672693/">Yossi Klein Halevi: Netanyahu&#39;s betrayal of a democracy is a betrayal of Israel</a><br><br> Nor is it clear that the army can be healed. If Israel chooses to withdraw from parts of the West Bank or is forced to do so, will religious soldiers—who now account for a significant majority of officers, and who are largely opposed to territorial compromise—obey the orders? Despite their disagreement with the government&#39;s policy, they did obey during the 2005 disengagement from Gaza. But if the opponents of judicial reform are now refusing to serve, other groups might one day do the same. Does a country that has been at war since its founding still have a functioning army? The answer is far from obvious.<br><br> C <span class="smallcaps">ritics of the protest movement</span> that has filled Israel&#39;s streets week after week make two simple claims. First, they say, it has long been clear that Israel needs some manner of judicial reform. Second, they remind those who will listen, this government was democratically elected. And some of those who ran (though, notably, not Netanyahu) were direct about their intentions if elected. So what the protests amount to, these critics claim, is the privileged class that founded the country—tech entrepreneurs, pilots, doctors, professors, judges, finance workers—being sore losers after their electoral defeat. Israel&#39;s demographic makeup has changed radically since the country&#39;s founding; the descendants of the founders are now a minority, and they might as well get used to it.<br><br> Many of the protesters acknowledged the need for judicial reform, but insisted that Netanyahu&#39;s proposal went too far. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r-5u_lT6TIc27SjireMrlNux1roM72C/view">Centrist academics</a> agreed with them. More ominous, the protest movement made clear to everyone that millions of Israelis were frightened by the proposed changes. Slow it down, they begged. Let&#39;s have a national conversation, or a constitutional convention, as was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.asefam.org/_files/ugd/e56056_068dba527b5c4005a11440cdea743084.pdf">suggested</a> by Netta Barak-Corren, a highly regarded Hebrew University law professor.<br><br> But those pressing for far-reaching and immediate reform—including Justice Minister Yariv Levin and Simcha Rothman, the chair of the Knesset Committee on Constitution, Law, and Justice—would have none of it. They told Netanyahu that if he hesitated, they would bring down his government.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/02/israel-palestine-west-bank-illegal-settlement-netanyahu/672944/">Read: From this hill, you can see the next Intifada</a><br><br> As the fateful vote was unfolding in the Knesset on Monday, Israelis were captivated by the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/tv-report-last-minute-compromise-idea-has-collapsed/">image</a> of Netanyahu sandwiched between Gallant, who was pleading for compromise, and Levin, who warned that he would tear down the government. The old Benjamin Netanyahu, master operator and manipulator, had withered. He&#39;d appointed Levin acting prime minister while he had a minor heart procedure earlier in the week. Netanyahu was out of sedation, Israelis quipped, but Levin was still running the government—right into the abyss, using his parliamentary majority to thumb his nose at all the elites who make Israel an economic, technological, academic, cultural, and military power. He ignored everyone who begged him to show some restraint, shredding the last pretense of a social contract.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">lmost every assumption</span> Israelis shared about how they might live together has now been torn asunder. Netanyahu brought the ultra-Orthodox parties into his government, as he has always done in the past. The <em>Haredim</em> , as they are known in Hebrew, are convenient coalition partners. They have no interest in foreign policy or most domestic issues; even holding on to settlements is hardly a major concern for them. They consistently make but two demands of whatever government they join, whether left, center, or right: They want government funding for their school system, and they want a continuation of the policy initiated by David Ben-Gurion, Israel&#39;s first prime minister, exempting young Haredi men from military service. Haredi schools teach little math or English, leaving their graduates utterly unprepared to enter the workforce, and exempting young Haredi men from military service so that they can continue studying in yeshivot further limits their exposure to secular society.<br><br> Ben-Gurion made the deal in Israel&#39;s early years because he assumed that the Haredim would be an anomaly in a modern, Jewish state, a vestige of pre-Holocaust European Jewry that would soon die off and disappear. But Ben-Gurion got that entirely wrong. The Haredim now constitute a massive economic and political force in Israel. Whereas 400 exemptions from military service were given each year in Ben-Gurion&#39;s time, by 2010, the number of Haredim excused from military service through the same arrangement had reached 62,500 annually—an increase of 15,000 percent, while Israel&#39;s overall population had grown only 1,200 percent.<br><br> Israel&#39;s previous government, headed by Naftali Bennett for a year and Yair Lapid for a shorter period, required Haredi schools that receive government funding to begin teaching basic secular studies. The Israeli public still took umbrage at Haredim not serving in the army, but seemed slightly assuaged by what appeared to be progress.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/09/yair-lapid-bibi-netanyahu-israel-extremism-centrism/671483/">Jeffrey Goldberg: The man who could end the Netanyahu era</a><br><br> So when Netanyahu reached a coalition deal with the ultra-Orthodox parties to again exempt their schools from offering secular studies and promised to pass a law permanently exempting their young men from military service, the unhappy but long-standing tolerance snapped. Protesters decrying the proposed judicial reform chanted about “equality.” Everyone understood they meant not only equality of rights, but equality of obligations. The protesters said they were done paying for the Haredim and protecting them. “They&#39;re sucking our blood,” one TV commentator <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-05-21/ty-article/israeli-tv-host-under-fire-after-accusing-haredim-of-being-bloodsuckers/00000188-3dee-d7fa-a1dc-bdef92100000">said</a> . She was roundly criticized and forced to apologize, even as many privately applauded the sentiment.<br><br> Rage at the ultra-Orthodox was compounded when Netanyahu tried to appoint Member of the Knesset Aryeh Deri, the leader of a Haredi party, to the position of finance minister. Deri was jailed after a 2000 conviction for taking bribes, was convicted of tax evasion a decade later, and then resigned from politics as part of a plea deal. Netanyahu is himself a defendant in several serious cases, but contends that as long as he is prime minister, he cannot be sent to jail. His plan to rehabilitate Deri&#39;s career stoked outrage not only at the prime minister, who seemed to drop every norm for the sake of his own freedom, but at the Haredim as well.<br><br> Yedidia Stern, a former dean of the law school at Bar Ilan University and head of the Israel Democracy Institute, is now president of the Jewish People Policy Institute. He is widely regarded as one of Israel&#39;s leading jurisprudential figures, and is also known to have a soft spot for the Haredim, for whose way of life he has great admiration. But, as he later told me, Stern went to see Deri at his home in March, as the brouhaha was unfolding. “You&#39;re about to make thousands of Haredi children hungry,” Stern told him. Deri looked puzzled. “You&#39;re in power now,” Stern explained. “But the left or the center is going to come back into power, now, in half a year, in a year, or maybe longer. But sooner or later, it is bound to happen. And when it does, the new government will not care one whit how hungry your children are, that their only hot meal a day comes from their school. The voters are going to completely turn off the spigot of government funding, and your community is going to sink even lower into poverty.”<br><br> Deri, Stern told me, stared at him in silence for a long moment. It was clear, Stern recalled, that Deri had suddenly understood.<br><br> Two weeks ago, Housing Minister Yitzhak Goldknopf, also a Haredi, responded to rumors that Netanyahu was going to drop the elimination of judicial review, by far the most controversial element of the judicial-reform package, from his legislative agenda. The Haredim see ending judicial review, a step that would prevent the Israeli Supreme Court from overriding a law permanently granting Haredi men military exemptions, as crucial. Goldknopf told reporters that ending judicial review was “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/haredi-minister-pm-promised-me-override-bill-imperative-for-coalition-survival/">a necessary condition</a> ” for the government&#39;s survival.<br><br> What Goldknopf had inadvertently done was signal to the hundreds of thousands of protesters in the streets that the notion that ending judicial review was about fixing a broken judicial system was mere pretense. The actual agenda was ending the court&#39;s ability to block the government&#39;s capitulation to the Haredim. Rage exploded again.<br><br> A few days later, though, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-20/ty-article/.premium/israeli-ultra-orthodox-newspaper-calls-for-rethink-of-judicial-overhaul/00000189-72fb-de4e-adeb-ffffb4240000"><em>Yated Ne&#39;eman</em></a> , a leading Haredi newspaper, seemed to back down. It reiterated its longtime stance that “democracy is fundamentally foreign to us” and that the Haredim are in exile in Israel no less than they were before the state existed. Still, it said, it would be unwise for Haredim to take a stand in the conflict. The editorial was a signal that many Haredim now fear they have overreached, and seek to avoid becoming collateral damage to the anger now sweeping across Israel.<br><br> S <span class="smallcaps">ome observers,</span> leading American Jewish philanthropists among them, have tenaciously held on to the hope that the Haredi world can slowly be opened. Even among the Haredim themselves, there are those who hope that the Haredi establishment will be punished for the role it has been playing in Israeli politics for decades.<br><br> Esty Shushan, the eldest of 12 brothers and sisters, is herself the mother of just four. That alone makes her a rebel within the Haredi world. She is a poet, a filmmaker, and the head of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nivcharot.com/our-team">Nivcharot</a> , an organization seeking to get Haredi women elected to the Knesset.<br><br> But she and her colleagues, she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxMzc9PwyAUwPG_Bm4jlB8FDhw6G07aRBe3MwJr0VJmW239782WWHd5-STfl_ecnUObxx8dB5dTHNpdSDb20GvmC8klDLoopRKCFgWFnbZKceGoYlScFQ5eYFlyZymRjpCSYxj1Q_V0oCWg9en18vK-MmfOyS-nz-Hgm_CI17VNzcfb8avhsbZx3qf9cXgGDF__ovY2XU6w1908XyZAK0AMIGZZFjTEb9fZMc_IZRR7QAzBhAJicHk1u23yWgDCFdukNvFN9e6P1X_Gm8RW5f0ZA0ft2zz6OAGGp872ISHrUOx_AwAA__8lalvd">acknowledges</a> , are a fringe group. The rabbis at the helm have no interest in women politicians, no tolerance for Haredi feminists, and, despite the disaster that secular illiteracy is for a younger Haredi generation, no interest in opening the community to the Western world. True, she admits, the younger generation manages to get information from the outside world even on “kosher” phones (which block most of the internet), because they have WhatsApp. Yet even with that flow of information, which her generation did not have when they were young, the power of the establishment shows no signs of cracking.<br><br> Shushan was asked in a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://email.mg2.substack.com/c/eJxMzc9PwyAUwPG_Bm4jlB8FDhw6G07aRBe3MwJr0VJmW239782WWHd5-STfl_ecnUObxx8dB5dTHNpdSDb20GvmC8klDLoopRKCFgWFnbZKceGoYlScFQ5eYFlyZymRjpCSYxj1Q_V0oCWg9en18vK-MmfOyS-nz-Hgm_CI17VNzcfb8avhsbZx3qf9cXgGDF__ovY2XU6w1908XyZAK0AMIGZZFjTEb9fZMc_IZRR7QAzBhAJicHk1u23yWgDCFdukNvFN9e6P1X_Gm8RW5f0ZA0ft2zz6OAGGp872ISHrUOx_AwAA__8lalvd">interview</a> what that younger generation needs to know. That the money the Haredim just won from the government is not going to get to the children who need it, she replied. It will go instead to a select group of leaders who could not be less interested in what will serve the needs of their flock.<br><br> Can a firebrand like Shushan engender a renewed conversation inside the Haredi community? She now has more than 20 young women working with her, she says, which is astonishing growth from where her organization was a decade ago, when she started it. But she&#39;s a woman. She&#39;s a feminist. She&#39;s a filmmaker. She&#39;s outside the norm in every way, marginalized with no obvious avenue for making a difference. The Haredi world will hurtle on into a collision with the rest of Israeli society, she fears—even though everyone would benefit from changing course.<br><br> E <span class="smallcaps">ven Israel&#39;s intellectual right</span> has been shaken by the tsunami of rage reshaping the Jewish state. Assaf Sagiv (with whom I used to work at the Shalem Center) is widely regarded as Israel&#39;s preeminent conservative public intellectual. But Sagiv has broken with the government (which he repeatedly says he hopes will fall) and with most of his former colleagues. On social media, he has been spewing vitriol deriding the government, its members of the Knesset, and its supporters.<br><br>为什么？ “Conservatism is a cooling ethos,” Sagiv said in a lengthy <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-03-03/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/why-this-leading-israeli-right-wing-figure-is-praying-for-the-governments-fall/00000186-a4b3-d3d5-a7e7-aeb7a19b0000">interview</a> with <em>Haaretz</em> , Israel&#39;s flagship left-leaning newspaper. “It&#39;s a movement that also prefers compromise over disputes. Religious Zionism was once a conciliatory, bridging force,” but those days are behind us.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1930/10/zionism-in-palestine/306754/">From the October 1930 issue: Zionism in Palestine</a><br><br> How did the Israeli right go so wrong? Sagiv says that the brand of conservatism at the heart of Israel&#39;s coalition is a direct import of populist American conservatism. But that, Sagiv said, is the last thing Israel needs: “American conservatism gives us a peephole into the future, and it doesn&#39;t bode well. The Republican Party is a political, moral and cultural disaster zone.”<br><br> “The Israeli right is now positioning itself behind a program that is no less than a constitutional coup,” Sagiv told the newspaper. What should Israelis expect if the plan is put into play? “The dismantlement of the state&#39;s institutions … splitting the spoils between party bosses who are battling one another for power and resources, loss of public security, looting of the public coffers and deterioration into general lawlessness.”<br><br> S <span class="smallcaps">agiv&#39;s prediction</span> is now being tested. The Knesset passed the first plank of the judicial-reform package late Monday. Almost immediately, renewed protests erupted across Israel. The police, worried that people were about to scale the security fences of the heavily guarded Knesset, called in reinforcements. In Tel Aviv, thousands of protesters blocked the Ayalon, the city&#39;s main highway, shutting it in both directions for hours.<br><br> Later that night, the police had had enough. They brought in water cannons to soak the protesters, and mounted officers rode their horses directly into the crowd. Israelis went to sleep with images of violence and utter bedlam playing on their television screens.<br><br> When they awakened the following morning, many were stunned to see that several of the country&#39;s newspapers had printed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://danielgordis.substack.com/p/the-ideological-roots-of-democracy">identical front pages</a> : Nothing but black, top to bottom, and the words “A dark day for Israeli democracy.”<br><br> Later that morning, leading news outlets <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/ry8dvep9n">announced</a> that United Torah Judaism, one of the key Haredi parties, was submitting a Basic Law—a piece of legislation with constitutional status—that would declare, once and for all, that Haredi men who study Torah would be considered to have served the country. Netanyahu&#39;s Likud put a stop to the move, this time at least, but the mere mention of the proposal gave Israelis a taste of what the future was likely to hold.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu/618358/">Read: &#39;Netanyahu is playing fire with the democrats&#39;</a><br><br> Every news outlet, it seemed, was trying to make sense of what had just happened. Would the opposition ask the Supreme Court to overturn the law that had been passed the previous night? It appears that it will, and most knowledgeable observers believe that there is a good chance the court will intervene. But what if the government then says that it does not recognize the court&#39;s authority?<br><br> David Barnea, the director of the Mossad, told a group of his concerned operatives what would happen if it suddenly became unclear who was in charge of the country, Israel&#39;s Channel 12 reported. “If things come to a constitutional crisis,” he assured them, “I will be on the right side”—intimating that he would side with the court against the government.<br><br> What that would look like is difficult to imagine. The security establishment against the government? The government denying the Supreme Court&#39;s authority? The tacit agreements that have held Israel together for 75 years are unraveling at an unimaginable pace.<br><br> Where does that leave us? The truth is that no one knows. Which made it hard to disagree when, the morning after the Knesset vote, former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert gave voice to our worst fears. Israel, he said, “is heading into civil war.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 16:13:42 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/-israel-netanyahu-political-crisis-supreme-court/674829/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/-israel-netanyahu-political-crisis-supreme-court/674829/</item></channel></rss>
