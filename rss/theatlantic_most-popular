2021 年 1 月 6 日履行了宪法义务，从而避免了美国政府的崩溃和可能随之而来的流血事件，而且最近他似乎正在大力批评他担任副总统的人。然而，和许多其他共和党领袖一样，彭斯似乎受到了一种死灵法师的诅咒，当他试图说出唐纳德·特朗普的名字时，他冒着被打哑的风险。<br><br>昨天，哥伦比亚广播公司记者加勒特少校<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-face-the-nation-aug-6-2023-transcript/">询问彭斯</a>是否仍会投票给特朗普。这是一个将垒球击出公园的机会。相反，他连击了。<br><br><p><b>加勒特少校：</b>你会再次投票给唐纳德·特朗普吗？</p><p><b>迈克·彭斯：</b>听着，我认为我不必这么做。我必须告诉你，无论我走到哪里——</p><p><b>加勒特：</b>副总统先生，这不是问题所在。你会再次投票给唐纳德·特朗普吗？</p><p><b>彭斯：</b>是的。是的，我知道你的问题是什么，但让我说得非常清楚：我竞选总统是因为我认为任何把自己置于宪法之上的人都不应该成为总统，也不应该再次成为总统。</p>嗯，这是一种方法。另一种说法是，“从个人经验来看，唐纳德·特朗普是椭圆形办公室里最危险的人，我将尽一切努力阻止他。”值得称赞的是，彭斯在 1 月 6 日开始采访时，用了足够长的时间使用特朗普的名字，并表示他“错了”。彭斯说，特朗普“那天要求我把他置于宪法之上，但我选择了宪法，而且我永远都会选择。”当被问及是否会作证反对特朗普时，彭斯再次呜咽道：“我没有计划作证，但人们可以相信我们会遵守法律。如果法律的召唤到来，我们将做出回应，而且我们只会说出真相。”<br><br>这并不是令人惊叹的反抗。我们也不应该对一位美国政客声称他将履行他过去多次宣誓的宪法誓言过分印象深刻。但在这个奇怪的时代，我们会采取我们能得到的东西。尽管如此，彭斯显然对这个问题感到不舒服，并尽一切努力将特朗普的名字排除在讨论之外，当你领导一场针对自己前竞选搭档的竞选活动时，这是一件奇怪的事情。<br><br>同样，考虑一下罗恩·德桑蒂斯 (Ron DeSantis) 勉强接受特朗普输掉 2020 年大选的事实。 “他当然输了，”德桑蒂斯今天在接受 NBC 新闻<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/-of-course-he-lost-ron-desantis-rejects-trump-s-2020-election-claims-190139973789">采访</a>时说道。 “乔·拜登是总统。”那么特朗普关于选举的谎言呢？ “未经证实，”佛罗里达州州长<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/us/politics/desantis-trump-election-2020.html">周五表示</a>。德桑蒂斯一直<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ron-desantis-of-course-trump-lost-2020-election-rcna98200">坚持</a>认为 2024 年的选举应该以乔·拜登为主题，但他似乎不愿意面对这样的现实：要挑战拜登就必须先击败特朗普。 <i>《纽约时报》的</i>一篇报道<i> </i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/07/us/politics/desantis-trump-2020-election.html">将</a>NBC 的评论称为“先生”。德桑蒂斯日益激进的立场”，如果你认为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/desantis-jan-6-trump/">从“无”到“有”的转变</a>是“越来越激进”，我认为这是正确的。<br><br>为什么共和党人如此害怕提及特朗普，即使是在这么晚的时候？原因有三个，其中两个是出于纯粹的怯懦，第三个则源于幻觉的主要策略。<br><br>对于共和党候选人来说，第一个也是最明显的问题是，对特朗普咆哮会激怒共和党的选民，他们中的许多人居住在共和党关心的地区和州。克里斯·克里斯蒂和阿萨·哈钦森愿意追随特朗普，因为他们都是脸皮厚的人，但也因为他们几乎没有机会获得共和党提名。乔治·威尔<a

（特朗普<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/05/trump-pence-has-gone-to-the-dark-side-00109960">已经在他的社交媒体平台Truth Social上抨击了</a>“Liddle”[<i>原文如此</i>]迈克·彭斯（Mike Pence），指责他是一个忘恩负义的失败者，“走向了黑暗面”。）特朗普对此感到震惊，当他瞄准他所认为的敌人时，他的攻击造成了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/threats-follow-trump-poliical-attacks/2020/10/28/c6dbce02-1792-11eb-82db-60b15c874105_story.html">真正的安全问题</a>：看看纽约付出了多少努力；华盛顿特区; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/07/31/georgia-2020-election-investigation-trump/">显然，亚特兰大</a>不得不承诺起诉或准备起诉特朗普。<br><br>然而，即使在不那么可怕的层面上，竞选总统——或者试图团结共和党剩下的人——也没有人会因为与特朗普无脑争吵而感到头疼。从德桑蒂斯和彭斯往下，共和党阵营都避免提及特朗普的名字，把他（正如<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/peacefield/61a69df40b037b002073ccd5/fight-like-adults/">我在 2021 年所写的</a>那样）视为某种古老的神或神秘的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/middle-ages-1000-1536/j-r-r-tolkien/balrog-medieval-monsters/">炎魔</a>，一提到他的名字就会出现并引发混乱。<br><br>最后，共和党初选候选人似乎都有一个由虚荣驱动的信念，即一旦特朗普因法律问题退出竞选，或者当其他不可抗力使他脱离董事会时，他们每个人都可以继承特朗普的选民。在某个地方，有一位战略家告诉他的客户，<i>如果不是特朗普</i>，<i> </i>选民会蜂拥而至，比如妮基·哈利 (Nikki Haley) 或维韦克·拉马斯瓦米 (Vivek Ramaswamy)。这就是《<i>堡垒》</i>作家蒂姆·米勒所说<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thetriad.thebulwark.com/p/ron-desantiss-prisoners-dilemma">的</a>“一场幻想初选”，这场初选是在“暗中厌恶特朗普的共和党精英的头脑中举行的，他们希望选民很快就会清醒过来”并选择其他人。<br><br>现在，确实，如果特朗普身体丧失行为能力——我不希望这位前总统有任何健康问题——那么，是的，共和党人将不得不寻找其他人。然而，除此之外，即使特朗普被监禁，他显然也会参选。 （没有<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/05/can-trump-run-for-president-from-prison.html">法律或宪法规则</a>阻止这种尝试。）他将继续攻击美国机构，他将继续发出几乎不加掩饰的暴力威胁， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/23/indictment-looms-trump-criticizes-calls-peace/">正如他一再所做的那样</a>， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/trumps-threatening-post-flagged-by-us-prosecutors-judge-2023-08-05/">即使是在被起诉的情况下</a>。<br><br>与此同时，其他共和党人无法说出特朗普的名字，无法以他不适合担任公职为由起诉他，也无法让共和党选民了解他涉嫌的任何犯罪活动。早在三月份， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/03/mike-pence-trump-january-6/673402/">我就曾写道</a>，彭斯“只有这一刻的勇气，不会再有其他的了。”不幸的是，我是对的。此时，其他共和党人在进入 2024

（我从未见过他；这个州可没<i>那么</i>小。）他曾担任过一届市长，并于 2006 年竞选美国参议员，但失败了。 2010年，他差点竞选罗德岛州州长；相反，他搬到了科罗拉多州，参加了 2013 年的州长竞选，然后退出了州长竞选，然后试图在 2014 年获得科罗拉多州第四国会选区的共和党提名（但失败了）。<br><br>那时我不太关注当地政治，所以我无法真正判断拉菲当市长是否出色。但他似乎是对新英格兰共和党财政保守和社会温和传统的倒退，这种传统在共和党中几乎已经绝迹。 <a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">公关</a>台词，例如生物武器和“自我复制”的机器。政府的行动对于保护人们的生命和生计至关重要——不仅要免受邪恶、超级智能机器的长期威胁，还要免受日常威胁。生成式人工智能已经表现出严重的偏见和滥用的可能性。十多年来，不太先进但同样不透明且常常具有歧视性的算法已被用于<a

<strong>1. 不要相信人工智能公司的任何言论。</strong><br><br>广告中用于化疗的药物必须在临床试验中明显使癌症患者受益，例如缩小肿瘤，然后获得 FDA 批准。然后其制造商必须披露患者可能经历的副作用。但人工智能产品不存在这样的责任。 AI Now Institute 常务董事、前 FTC 人工智能高级顾问 Sarah Myers West 告诉我：“公司声称人工智能能够做 X 或 Y 件事，但随后却没有证实它们可以做到。”许多科技公司因<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90597594/ai-algorithm-auditing-hirevue">歪曲</a>其<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/a-guide-to-healthy-skepticism-of-artificial-intelligence-and-coronavirus/">算法的</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing">偏见</a>或<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jwatch.org/na53777/2021/09/07/epics-sepsis-model-not-ready-prime-time">有效性</a>而受到批评， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qjpkmx/fac-recognition-company-lied-to-school-district-about-its-racist-tech">或者</a>几乎没有提供<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://predictive-optimization.cs.princeton.edu/">评估</a>它们的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3324874">证据</a>。<br><br>民主与技术中心主席亚历山德拉·吉文斯表示，强制人工智能工具接受第三方测试，以确保它们符合商定的偏见、准确性和可解释性指标，“是非常重要的第一步”。互联网隐私和人权倡导者，并从科技行业获得一些资金，告诉我。公司可能被迫披露有关其程序如何训练、软件的局限性以及如何减轻潜在危害的信息。 “目前，信息不对称现象非常严重，”她说，科技公司往往很少透露他们如何训练和验证其软件。审计可能涉及测试计算机视觉程序错误识别黑人与白人面孔的频率，或者聊天机器人是否将某些工作与刻板的性别角色联系起来（ChatGPT <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aisnakeoil.com/p/quantifying-chatgpts-gender-bias">曾经</a>指出律师不能怀孕，因为律师必须是男性）。<br><br>我采访过的所有专家都同意，科技公司本身不应该能够宣称自己的产品是安全的。罗格斯大学法学教授埃伦·古德曼告诉我，否则，就会存在<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/6580/text">进行事后</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/07/06/new-york-ai-hiring-law">审计</a>，但其他提案则呼吁更早开始安全评估。加州大学洛杉矶分校的互联网研究学者萨菲亚·诺布尔 (Safiya Noble) 告诉我，人工智能的潜在高风险应用意味着这些公司“必须证明其产品无害，然后才能将其投放市场”。<br><br>明确的基准和许可证也至关重要：如果淡化，政府标准将不会有效，而大杂烩的安全标签会造成混乱，甚至难以辨认，类似于散养、散养和牧场之间的<a data-event-element="inline link"

<strong>2.我们不需要人工智能部门。</strong><br><br>对人工智能系统进行基本评估和披露不需要新的政府机构，尽管这是一些科技高管<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-president-backs-new-agency-to-regulate-chatgpt-other-ai-systems-c847bae0">所呼吁</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://techpolicy.press/transcript-senate-judiciary-subcommittee-hearing-on-oversight-of-ai/">的</a>。现有法律适用于人工智能的许多用途：治疗机器人、自动化财务助理、承诺真实反应的搜索引擎。反过来，相关联邦机构拥有执行这些法律的专业知识；例如，FDA 可能必须评估和批准像医疗设备这样的治疗机器人。吉文斯说：“在指定一个负责所有事情的中央人工智能机构时，你就失去了算法评估最重要的方面，即部署它的背景是什么，以及对它的影响是什么。”那一组特定的社区？”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">阅读：人工智能厄运论是一个诱饵</a><br><br>一个新的人工智能部门可能会面临<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">监管捕获</a>的风险，主要人工智能公司会为该机构配备人员、提供建议和游说。相反，专家告诉我，他们希望看到现有机构获得更多资金来雇用员工和开发人工智能专业知识，这可能需要国会采取行动。分布式人工智能研究所的研究主任亚历克斯·汉纳（Alex Hanna）告诉我：“如果你为现有执法机构提供更多资源，可能会采取一种非常积极的方式，让他们更有能力做到这一点。”<br><br> <strong>3. 白宫可以以身作则。</strong><br><br>影响深远的人工智能监管立法可能需要数年时间，并面临科技公司在法庭上的挑战。另一种可能更快的方法可能是联邦政府在其使用的人工智能模型、其支持的研究以及其支付的资金方面以身作则。例如，今年早些时候，一个联邦工作组<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/news-updates/2023/01/24/national-artificial-intelligence-research-resource-task-force-releases-final-report/">建议</a>政府投入 26 亿美元资助人工智能研究和开发。任何希望获得这些资源的公司都可能被迫满足一系列标准，这可能会导致整个行业的采用——有点类似于《通货膨胀减少法案》中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/10/inflation-reduction-act-climate-economy/671659/">鼓励</a>绿色能源的税收优惠和补贴。<br><br>政府也是人工智能本身的主要<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/understanding-artificial-intelligence-spending-by-the-u-s-federal-government/">购买者</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/19/gary-peters-ai-laws-washington-00106922">用户</a>，可以要求其供应商接受审计并发布透明度报告。吉文斯告诉我：“拜登政府能做的最重要的事情就是制定具有约束力的政府政策，即只有经过有意义的安全性、有效性、非歧视性和保护人们隐私的测试，人工智能才能被购买、开发和使用。”<br><br> <strong>4.人工智能需要防篡改密封。</strong><br><br> Deepfake 和其他合成媒体（人工智能系统可以在几秒钟内生成的图像、视频和音频剪辑）已经传播了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/generative-ai-disinformation-synthetic-media-history/673260/">错误信息</a>，并被用于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/deepfake-porn-ai-misinformation/674475/">未经同意的色情内容</a>。上个月的自愿承诺包括开发一个水印，告诉用户他们正在与人工智能生成的内容进行交互，但语言含糊不清，前进的道路也不清楚。许多现有的水印方法，例如<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/dall-e-2">DALL-E 2</a>生成的任何图像底部的彩虹像素块，都很容易操纵或<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://help.openai.com/en/articles/6468065-dall-e-content-policy-faq">删除</a>。更强大的方法包括记录媒体的创建地点、时间和方式（就像相机的数字印章）以及它所经历的每一次编辑。 Adobe、微软和索尼等公司已经在努力实施这样的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://c2pa.org/">标准</a>，尽管公众可能很难理解这种方法。<br><br>人权组织 Witness 的执行董事萨姆·格雷戈里 (Sam Gregory) 告诉我，政府对人工智能生成的内容进行标记的标准需要在整个人工智能供应链中得到执行，从文本到图像模型的制造商到应用程序和应用程序的制造商。网络浏览器开发人员。我们需要防篡改密封，而不是贴纸。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/deepfake-synthetic-media-technology-rise-disinformation/672519/">阅读：是时候再次担心深度伪造了</a><br><br>古德曼告诉我，为了鼓励采用标准方式来表示人工智能内容，政府可以强制要求网络浏览器、计算机和其他设备识别该标签。这样的授权类似于联邦<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fcc.gov/consumers/guides/v-chip-putting-restrictions-what-your-children-watch">要求</a>新电视包含一个被称为“V 芯片”的部件，该部件承认电视行业设定的成熟度评级，家长可以用它来阻止节目。<br><br> <strong>5. 为人们建立保护其工作免受人工智能侵害的方法。</strong><br><br>目前，多起备受瞩目的诉讼指控人工智能模型（例如<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/9/23788741/sarah-silverman-openai-meta-chatgpt-llama-copyright-infringement-chatbots-artificial-intelligence-ai">ChatGPT</a>和图像生成器<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.artnews.com/art-in-america/features/midjourney-ai-art-image-generators-lawsuit-1234665579/">Midjourney</a> ）窃取作家和艺术家的作品。知识产权已成为生成式人工智能争论的核心，两种一般类型的版权侵权正在发挥作用：模型训练所依据的图像、文本和其他数据，以及它们吐出的图像和文本。<br><br>范德比尔特大学法学教授 Daniel Gervais 告诉我，在输入方面，关于生成人工智能模型违反版权法的指控可能会在法庭上失败。在线复制图像、文章、视频和其他媒体来开发训练数据集可能属于“合理使用”，因为在这些材料上训练人工智能模型会有意义地改变它。证明输出方面侵犯版权的标准也可能会带来困难，因为证明人工智能输出与特定的受版权保护的作品相似——不仅是凯欣德·威利的风格，而且与他的一幅画作的随地吐痰的图像相似——是一个困难的问题。法律门槛高。<br><br> Gervais 表示，他认为权利持有者和人工智能开发者之间经过市场谈判达成的协议将在任何法律标准出台之前达成。例如，在欧盟，艺术家和作家可以<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://creativecommons.org/2023/06/14/european-parliament-gives-green-light-to-ai-act-moving-eu-towards-finalizing-the-worlds-leading-regulation-of-ai/">选择不</a>将他们的作品用于训练人工智能，这可能会刺激一项符合艺术家和硅谷利益的交易。 “出版商将其视为收入来源，而科技公司在他们的技术上投入了大量资金，”热尔韦说。另一种可能的选择是更加严格的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ipwatchdog.com/2023/07/13/senate-ip-subcommittee-mulls-federal-right-publicity-ai-copyright-hearing/id=163469/">选择加入标准</a>，这将要求任何拥有受版权保护的材料的人提供其数据使用的明确许可。热尔韦说，在美国，选择退出可能是不必要的。通过的一项保护互联网版权的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.copyright.gov/legislation/dmca.pdf">法律规定</a>，剥夺文件中的“版权管理信息”（例如作品创作者和出版日期的标签）是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1202">非法的</a>，许多观察家<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://stablediffusionlitigation.com/pdf/00201/1-1-stable-diffusion-complaint.pdf">声称</a>创建数据集来训练生成人工智能违反了该法律。<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap12.html">每件作品删除此类信息的罚款可能高达数万美元</a>，对于其他版权侵权行为，罚款甚至更高——这种财务风险，乘以数据集中可能数以百万计的违规行为，对于公司来说可能太大了，无法承担。<br><br>这些保单即使有，也很少能得到保证。他们面临着许多实际的、政治的和法律的障碍，其中最重要的是硅谷强大的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2023-07-05/ai-congress-regulation-lobbying">游说力量</a>。仅靠这些法规也不足以阻止科技对美国人产生的所有负面影响。人工智能领域充斥着侵犯隐私、垄断商业行为和工人待遇不佳等问题，所有这些多年来一直困扰着科技行业。<br><br><br>但<em>某种</em>监管即将出台：拜登政府表示正在制定<a

data-event-element="inline link"

Chutkan)。他在阿拉巴马州和南卡罗来纳州发表了愤怒的演讲。他嘲笑美国女足国家队，指责乔·拜登总统提前退出世界杯， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110842705795010789">莫名其妙地嘲笑</a>前众议院议长南希·佩洛西（“她是一个邪恶的女巫，她丈夫的地狱之旅从她开始，到她结束。她是一个生病和精神错乱的精神病人，有一天会生活在地狱里！”）。他派他的律师去制作所有五个主要的周日早间电视节目。 <a

“精神错乱的杰克·史密斯正在他的头号选秀权、他的‘梦想’的法官（他必须被撤职！）面前，试图剥夺我的第一修正案权利——尽管事实上他，司法部，和他的许多暴徒检察官，正在非法向假新闻媒体泄露一切！” <a data-event-element="inline link"

Chutkan（“当法官“分配”到可笑的言论自由/公平选举案件时，我不可能得到公平的审判”）。<br><br>通常不建议将攻击案件中的法官和检察官作为辩护策略，但特朗普对礼貌、礼貌或基本常识没有什么用处。史密斯显然正在注意；检察官在法庭文件中引用了社交媒体上一条含糊威胁的帖子，该帖子发布几小时后。 （消息称：“如果你追我，我就追你！”；特朗普发言人声称，这实际上是针对“绿诺集团、热爱中国、不诚实的特殊利益集团和超级政治行动委员会”。）特朗普对查特坎的猛烈抨击，查特坎是一位黑人奥巴马任命的人，他甚至还没有机会在此案中做出任何重大决定，而他对艾琳·坎农法官缺乏批评，艾琳·坎农是特朗普任命的法官，负责监督佛罗里达州的案件，因为他对机密处理不当。文件，如果不令人惊讶的话，也是值得注意的。<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/profit"><em>《南方公园》</em>中的内裤侏儒模因</a>：第一步和期望的结果很清楚，但中间的步骤可能是什么却完全神秘。尽管特朗普称史密斯“精神错乱”，但这位特别检察官却显得异常、甚至不可思议地冷漠。与其他特区法官一样，Chutkan 驳回了之前关于 1 月 6 日审判无法在该地区公平进行的说法。<br><br>另一种理论认为，特朗普只是在迎合公众舆论，而不是法院。昨天，特朗普的律师约翰·劳罗(John Lauro)在周日节目中巡回演出，这一策略被环城公路的书呆子们称为“完整的金斯伯格”(Full Ginsburg)，以莫妮卡·莱温斯基(Monica Lewinsky)的律师威廉·金斯伯格(William

href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Ginsburg">总统候选人使用的工具</a>——但作为审前策略却有些令人困惑。<br><br>特朗普通常更感兴趣的是唤醒他的支持者，而不是寻求谨慎的辩护，显然他认为，无论他在法律方面存在什么问题，他的政治影响力都足以逃避或至少巧妙地应对危险。在针对他的两起联邦案件中，他可能最终面临不那么容易规避的指控，但他的反应不一定跟上。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/jeffrey-clark-doj-weaponization-trump-indictment/674898/">大卫·A·格雷厄姆：司法部的真正武器化</a><br><br>在某种程度上，公关攻势可能正在发挥作用。根据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-indictment-jan-6-opinion-poll-2023-08-06/">哥伦比亚广播公司新闻/YouGov 的一项新民意调查</a>，超过一半的美国人认为对特朗普的指控旨在损害他的 2024 年竞选活动，尽管绝大多数人也认为这些指控是为了维护法治和捍卫民主。但劳罗在电视上提出的实际论点似乎并不是特别精心设计，而且似乎反而强化了这样一个现实：无论公众是否希望他被定罪，他们都对特朗普试图窃取选举结果感到震惊。<br><br>劳罗在不同场合辩称，特朗普所谓的行为是“有抱负的”。例如，“特朗普总统没有做的是指示副总统彭斯做任何事情，”劳罗在美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 上说道。 “他以一种渴望的方式问他。”他还称特朗普要求佐治亚州国务卿布拉德·拉芬斯佩格“找到 11,780 票”是一个“雄心勃勃的要求”。这种毫无区别的区分给律法主义带来了坏名声。劳罗还表示，即使特朗普“技术上违反了宪法”，他也没有犯罪。 But telling the public that your client violated the Constitution seems like a questionable PR decision.<br><br> Neither Lauro, in his five appearances, nor Trump, going back to his initial response to the indictment, has actually rebutted the charges. Trump has claimed that the government is attacking his right to free speech, but he has made nearly no effort to question the specifics of the charges. A rare example is his denial of Pence&#39;s claim that Trump said he was “too honest.” More broadly, Trump hasn&#39;t offered any bigger explanation for his weeks-long push to subvert the election.

As the award-winning historian Blair LM Kelley explains in her new book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/black-folk-the-roots-of-the-black-working-class-blair-lm-kelley/9781631496554?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Black Folk: The Roots of the Black Working Class</i></a> , Black people are more likely to be working-class than white people are.<br><br> Kelley&#39;s <i>Black Folk</i> opens our minds up to Black workers, narrating their complex lives over 200 years of American history. Kelley looks at the history of her own working-class ancestors, as well as the laundresses, Pullman porters, domestic maids, and postal workers who made up the world of Black labor. Their joys. Their skills. Their challenges. She also offers historical context for the racist ideas about Black workers that endure in our time, while highlighting the ways that Black labor organizing has always helped to fight back against bigotry.<br><br> Myths about race and class continue to dominate our political discourse. For a start, it is a myth that Americans without college degrees are, by definition, “working class.” Accumulated or inherited wealth is a more accurate indicator of class status than education (or salary), particularly amid an enormous <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/eliminating-black-white-wealth-gap-generational-challenge/">racial wealth gap</a> in the United States. Wealth levels of Black households whose members have a college degree <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/why-do-black-college-graduates-have-lower-homeownership-rate-white-people-who-dropped-out-high-school">are similar to</a> those of white households whose members don&#39;t have a high-school diploma. And those white high-school dropouts have higher homeownership rates than Black college graduates. Even if we were measuring working-class status by college-degree attainment, white Americans (50.2 percent) are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kqed.org/mindshift/61037/college-completion-rates-are-up-for-all-americans-but-racial-gaps-persist">far and away</a> more likely than Black Americans (34.2 percent), Latino Americans (27.8 percent), and Native Americans (25.4 percent) to have a college degree, and therefore not be working class by this inadequate measure.<br><br> It is also a myth that “the white working class is synonymous with supporters of Donald Trump,” as Kelley points out in <i>Black Folk</i> . In fact, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2017/06/05/its-time-to-bust-the-myth-most-trump-voters-were-not-working-class/">Trump&#39;s base remains much more affluent</a> than is popularly portrayed. “It&#39;s not necessarily a question of [Trump voters] needing to be educated,” Kelley told me when we spoke recently. “It&#39;s a set of choices that people are making about their place in the world, and what makes them feel verified and validated.”<br><br> All of these myths comprise our “national mythos,” which “leaves little room for Black workers,” writes Kelley, the incoming director of the Center for the Study of the American South at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. We discussed what lessons we can glean from their history, from their everyday lives, from their political organizing. Our conversation began with the Black folk we know best: our families.<br><br> <i>This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.</i><br><br> <b>Ibram X. Kendi:</b> <i>Black Folk</i> opens by chronicling the life story of your maternal grandfather, who was facing and fighting racism in the town of Canon, in northeast Georgia. What was striking for me was that my maternal grandfather, Alvin, is from Guyton, which is also in eastern Georgia, though closer to Savannah. He dealt with racism there as well, fled to New York City. Your maternal grandfather made his way to North Carolina. Such similarities. Why did you decide to start the book there?<br><br> <b>Blair LM Kelley:</b> It&#39;s such a formative story for my family. It&#39;s one my mother repeated many, many times. I think my mother really wanted me to understand the degree to which slavery had ended but the circumstances of subjugation had not. She wanted me to get how close that was to my lived experience, that it wasn&#39;t this far-off, distant thing that was long gone.<br><br> Tying my family to this larger history, I know that&#39;s a story so many people have of being forced to flee. I really wanted to begin with that because I knew how universal it was.<br><br> <b>Kendi:</b> You specifically wanted <i>Black Folk</i> to “capture the character of the lives of Black workers, seeing them not just as laborers, or members of a class, or activists, but as people whose daily experiences mattered.” Why was capturing the character of their full lives so important?<br><br> <b>Kelley:</b> I have never really thought of myself as a labor historian. Labor history had such a focus on institutions and unions, and infighting between organizations. Those were interesting, and things you need to know. But they weren&#39;t the ways that I knew my folks. My folks were workers, but their lives, their whole lives, affected the way that they thought about that work. And I hadn&#39;t seen as much labor history that was focused on what the whole being was like. Not just a factory-floor version of history, but rather a church, a house, a mother-daughter relationship. Those kinds of things I wanted to see amplified, because I think they&#39;re just as meaningful for workers&#39; lives—if not more so—than the atomized workspace.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1913/06/the-negro-and-the-labor-unions/529524/">Read: Booker T. Washington in the Atlantic on labor unions and civil rights</a><br><br> <b>Kendi:</b> You start by writing about a blacksmith who was born in slavery—and then move on to other jobs, like washerwomen, train-car porters, domestic maids, and postal workers. Why specifically those occupations? Are there any specific occupations today that Black working folk occupy that we could potentially see as archetypal, or similar to some of these historical jobs?<br><br> <b>Kelley:</b> I think that domestic workers are really still an incredible population to think about. Their organizing is really incredible, and something I want to keep thinking about in my future work. I&#39;m very much interested in following postal workers now. I think especially during the COVID pandemic, we could see that there&#39;s a real fight being waged around postal work that I think deserves continued attention. The pandemic, again, made us think about Black people in medical care, particularly certified nursing assistants. The ranks of these nurses are enormously filled by Black women, and they bore the brunt of the pandemic. The gig economy is also really interesting to me. Black people are overrepresented in that space as well.<br><br> <b>Kendi:</b> You write that when Black workers are mentioned at all, the very idea of work is dropped entirely. And instead they are described as “the poor,” and often implied to be unworthy and unproductive. This is an echo of the characterization of enslaved Black people as lazy and unmotivated. And you wrote this in the opening pages of the book to really set the stage for a larger argument. What was that larger argument?<br><br> <b>Kelley:</b> It&#39;s that I think there is an incredible mislogic around the Black working class, one born in slavery. I put a quote from Thomas Jefferson about him observing Black people and writing in <i>Notes on the State of Virginia</i> that they sleep a lot. And I&#39;m like, <i>Sir, as you sit in your chair, and somebody fans you and brings you your food, who are you calling lazy?</i> And so that stereotype and its afterlife in our contemporary thinking is a confounding one to me. It&#39;s one I really wanted to confront and unpack and pull the thread of throughout the text. Because Black workers&#39; contributions to this country are enormous. So calling Black folk “lazy” or “the poor” misunderstands what we&#39;ve done and how we think of ourselves.<br><br> <b>Kendi:</b> You also point out that there&#39;s a misunderstanding that Black workers are unskilled. Specifically in writing about laundresses, you wrote about the immense skill required. Is the idea of these Black workers as unskilled connected to the idea of them as unmotivated and lazy—an extension of that?<br><br> <b>Kelley:</b> Yes. I was fascinated by the skilled-labor/unskilled-labor dynamic that scholars had used for understanding work. It really struck me during the pandemic. The United Farm Workers were showing videos of farmworkers bundling radishes or picking cauliflower, harvesting asparagus and moving with such speed that you could barely see how they did it. And they&#39;re classed as unskilled workers. Still today, that&#39;s how we would describe them. And so, for me, reading the accounts of picking cotton, or washing laundry, or working on a Pullman car—all of those things took knowledge and study and skill. I just wanted to blow up that scholarly assumption about what is skilled and what is unskilled.<br><br> <b>Kendi:</b> Many of those Black people who were called unskilled in the past—and even today—worked in service-related occupations. I mention that because there&#39;s the racist idea that Black people are by nature servile, which undercuts the idea that they&#39;re actually highly skilled in doing these jobs. Do you see that too?<br><br> <b>Kelley:</b> Yes. I think when you look at people like the Pullman porters, many of whom were highly educated—they were preferred if they had some education. Because being able to have conversations, to anticipate what people need—they really were the first form of a concierge on these train cars—it really necessitated tremendous knowledge and skill for what might look like just a job serving. It&#39;s a reminder of the dexterity of mind that many people bring to things that we think of as service.<br><br> And the ways in which they could serve one another, and use their platform to envision better rights for all workers, it&#39;s really incredible. So often we think of unions as selfish. That&#39;s part of the negative narrative that we have of unions. That they&#39;re taking fees from the workers, and they don&#39;t do much and they don&#39;t really help out. But when we look at a union like the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, we see that they started the entire nation in expanding our concept of citizenship and civil rights.<br><br> <b>Kendi:</b> Indeed, A. Phillip Randolph, the founder of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, was the person behind the March on Washington in 1963, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his “I Have a Dream” speech. These car porters strove to advance themselves. But you write about how when Black workers are able to start making more money, or owning land, or even start businesses, they typically avoided “outward indications of success.” Racists imagined them to be uppity or even forgetting their place. But what about Black elites? What did they think about the Black working class, then and now?<br><br> <b>Kelley:</b> If you look back at Black newspapers in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, you&#39;ll find them admonishing workers, “Don&#39;t go out and spend your money on these particular kinds of things. Be very frugal. Don&#39;t go to the tap rooms and buy all these fancy clothes to wear on Sundays.” So there are parallels with the current Black elite. That&#39;s an old trope Black communities have been bouncing around for a really long time: that somehow you can save your way out of the circumstances that make working-class life much more difficult.<br><br> The space for pleasure, and the space for enjoyment and pride in how you look and what you have, and the ways in which working folk have spent money have always been criticized. “I don&#39;t look like what my job is; I look like who I want to look like”—that kind of pride is traditionally a Black working-class thing. Although it looks very different today when wearing a Gucci belt or something.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/how-build-union-victory-amazon-staten-island/629464/">Read: Is organized labor making a comeback?</a><br><br> <b>Kendi:</b> Members of the Black working class have not only carved out spaces for pleasure and enjoyment and pride. They have carved out spaces for politics, for organizing, for unions. You talk about how members of the Black working class are more likely to be union members today than any other racial group. Based on your research, why do you think that&#39;s happening? Which is to ask, why do you think Black people are at the forefront of this boom of union organizing and activism in our time?<br><br> <b>Kelley:</b> I think Black workers have a different outlook on the narratives around unionizing, and what value unions might have. Black workers are already in a critical stance to say, “Well, no, let me evaluate this for myself. And no, actually I think a union would help!” Coming together is a way to aid us and lift us. It fits the narrative of the wider lives we have lived in our families and communities. Unions just resonate with how Black communities have fought over time, which is why we see Black folks forming unions from the very first moments of freedom, all the way till right now.<br><br> <b>Kendi:</b> You even described enslaved Black folks running away as engaging in nascent labor strikes.<br><br> <b>Kelley:</b> Absolutely. They understood what a difference their labor made. So often we forget that people who are subjugated have intellectual lives.<br><br> <b>Kendi:</b> Definitely. That brings me to two quotes from your book that I wanted you to reflect on. The first touches on what we were just talking about—how Minnie Savage, a child of exploited and constrained sharecroppers, knew the value of her crop-picking in Accomack County, Virginia. At 16 years old, she fled. You write, “Minne dreamed of living in a place where it didn&#39;t feel like they were slaves anymore. A place where she could be paid fairly for her hard work. A place where she could safely join with others to demand fair treatment. She had to leave Accomack to &#39;get freed from freedom.&#39;”<br><br> <b>Kelley:</b> I love Minnie as a figure, and finding her interview was such a gift. She happened to be from the place where my grandfather was from. And it was so interesting to follow her as she made her way to Philadelphia. Just remember that, for so many, migration was this big dream of possibility and the vision of something new and something broader and something stronger. And chronicling her disappointment in what happened in the first decades after she migrates, and then also chronicling that she does end up with something much stronger, and something she&#39;s really proud of—she was an amazing figure to write about.<br><br> <b>Kendi:</b> And finally: “The Trump-caused obsession with the white working class … has obscured the reality that the most active, most engaged, most informed, and most impassioned working class in America is the Black working class.”<br><br> <b>Kelley:</b> I&#39;m a scholar of Black people, and I love Black people. I think we learn so much when we shift our gaze, when we think differently, when we pay attention to other people and glean from their history. Black life has so much to teach all of us about what is possible.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 14:28:23 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/black-folk-book-working-class-blair-lm-kelley/674935/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/black-folk-book-working-class-blair-lm-kelley/674935/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Seven Books That Will Make You Put Down Your Phone]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> These titles self-consciously aim to grab their reader&#39;s attention. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/caY-Vi1xSW7IkSFO8j6GwbHQ9rA=/0x0:3500x1969/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/Atlantic_1/original.jpg" alt="A book with a ton of eyeballs attached to the cover, all looking different ways" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Matt Chase</figcaption></figure> When I teach a literature class to undergraduates, one of my most important tasks is to help my students relearn how to read in the age of distraction. I assign them an exercise: Set a timer for 20 minutes and dive into a book, no phone in sight, and don&#39;t stop before the alarm goes off. They frequently tell me that time moves differently when they do this. The first few minutes drag, and the exercise feels totally impossible and dull, but as they keep sitting and reading, they begin to focus on the world inside the pages in front of them. By the end, they&#39;re usually surprised by the timer ringing, and hungry to keep reading.<br><br> My students aren&#39;t the only ones who benefit from this exercise, and the activity works with any book. But this list will offer you a head start. The seven titles below self-consciously aim to grab their reader&#39;s attention, whether through form or content. Each will pull you into reading in a different way: Some are brief and succinct; others are long and sprawling. Some use the second person to directly address the reader; others dive deeply into one subject and invite you along. But what they all have in common is their ability to refresh your powers of observation and make you see the real world in a new manner by the end.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/mrs-caliban-rachel-ingalls/9780811226691?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Mrs. Caliban</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Rachel Ingalls</strong><br><br> The first book I recommend to anyone in a reading slump is <em>Mrs. Caliban</em> , a novella that&#39;s less than 150 pages, with a fascinating plot and quick pacing. Written in 1982 but reissued in 2017, <em>Mrs. Caliban</em> follows Dorothy, a lonely 1950s-style housewife, who meets Larry, an amphibious sea creature who looks almost exactly like a man, just with green skin and webbed hands and feet. Larry finds refuge from his scientist captors in Dorothy&#39;s house, and the two have an oddly romantic affair right under her husband, Fred&#39;s, nose. Dorothy and Fred are “too unhappy to get a divorce,” so Larry is actually a welcome guest who offers Dorothy not only exotic tales about an underwater world, but also a listening ear for her struggles as a housewife. People (including my students) have speculated that Guillermo del Toro&#39;s film <em>The Shape of Water</em> is loosely based on <em>Mrs. Caliban</em> , which makes sense—Ingalls&#39;s writing is hypnotic and cinematic, and <em>Mrs. Caliban</em> is the kind of book you can read in one sitting: It captures your attention like a blockbuster.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1986/04/discovery-of-the-month/667376/">Read: Discovery of the month (from 1986)</a><br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-fifth-season-n-k-jemisin/9780316229296?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>The Fifth Season</em></strong></a> <strong>, by NK Jemisin</strong><br><br> The end of <em>The Fifth Season</em> has my favorite section of any speculative-fiction or fantasy novel: a huge glossary of terms such as <em>stone eaters</em> , <em>commless</em> , and <em>orogene</em> that appears after the plot stops, giving the reader a hand in interpreting the wildly unconventional world of the book. And it&#39;s helpful here, because the complex, intricate story takes place on a supercontinent called the Stillness that is on the verge of its regular apocalypse, known as the “fifth season,” a period of catastrophic climate change. “Orogenes,” who can use thermal energy to create seismic events, are considered dangerous people, and most are in hiding, shunned from society. Jemisin&#39;s main character, Essun, is one of them, hiding her true identity as she works as a teacher in her village. She returns home one day to find that her husband has murdered her son and kidnapped her daughter—both of whom inherited her powers. She must journey to save her daughter, accompanied by a mysterious child, while the world around her crumbles. After reading a few chapters of <em>The Fifth Season</em> , you&#39;ll be immersed in this new world and its intricacies, enraptured by the ways this society&#39;s structures shed light on the worst realities of our own.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/if-on-a-winter-s-night-a-traveler-italo-calvino/9780156439619?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>If on a Winter&#39;s Night a Traveler</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Italo Calvino</strong><br><br> A story that has an experimental or mysterious structure turns you into a detective, trying to figure out not just what happened, but also why the writing is the way it is. To me, the most delightful work in this vein is <em>If on a Winter&#39;s Night a Traveler</em> , by Italo Calvino, a book about someone called the Reader and addressed as “you,” who is constantly undercut in his attempt to read a novel called <em>If on a Winter&#39;s Night a Traveler</em> , by Italo Calvino. Right away, the Reader finds that his copy has been misprinted, bound with another novel, which he then buys—but he only gets so far into his second choice before that one is interrupted too. Each novel he picks up is somehow confiscated, unfinished, missing, or full of mistakes. But as the Reader picks up story after story, never able to finish, he meets his female counterpart, Ludmilla, who is trying to read the same titles. The loops of their impossible journey are postmodern, but the tone isn&#39;t abstract or cerebral—it&#39;s funny and sweet. The metafiction of Calvino&#39;s novel, literally addressed to “you,” dramatizes the difficulty of paying attention and finding just the right book. Ironically, it&#39;s totally easy to read, as the Reader&#39;s choices flip from romance to thriller to realist novel, all interwoven with one man&#39;s journey to find his love.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/her-body-and-other-parties-stories-carmen-maria-machado/9781555977887?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Her Body and Other Parties</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Carmen Maria Machado</strong><br><br> Short-story collections can deploy a variety of tones and styles that most novels can&#39;t—each story can be totally unique. <em>Her Body and Other Parties</em> has such an unbelievable range, trafficking in the funny, the bizarre, the unreal, and the haunting, that any reader could find something arresting in it. Machado reimagines the tale of the girl with the green ribbon around her neck right alongside a novella, “Especially Heinous,” in which the characters of <em>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</em> contend with ghosts and doppelgängers. Even when she&#39;s riffing on episodes of TV that the audience is familiar with, Machado makes the known world look stranger; as a result, supernatural occurrences begin to seem more and more logical. In another story, “Inventory,” a woman lists all of her sexual experiences while the world is slowly consumed by a pandemic. Her nostalgia for the way things used to be morphs into horror at what the world has become—and her lists, on the surface recalling the past but really narrating the present, become a way to cope with the uncertainty each day brings. Likewise, each story in <em>Her Body and Other Parties</em> does many things at once, every genre bent and every first impression unreliable, always fresh and also frightening.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/gathering-moss-a-natural-and-cultural-history-of-mosses-robin-wall-kimmerer/9780870714993?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Gathering Moss</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Robin Wall Kimmerer</strong><br><br> Paying attention is not the topic but the mode of Kimmerer&#39;s first book, <em>Gathering Moss</em> . Whereas her 2013 collection, <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em> , delves into the many overlaps between Indigenous and scientific knowledge systems, here Kimmerer is deeply focused on just one organism: moss. Over a series of short personal essays, she peers at the tiny world of moss and what it can teach us. Moss can give us metaphors for our life, help us understand our relationships, and show us the way tiny things order the larger world, she argues. Relying on her background as a scientist and an Indigenous scholar, she shows us how rich, how deserving of respect, and how shockingly beautiful the minuscule world really is. Kimmerer writes about looking up from her microscope after examining moss and being “taken aback at the plainness of the ordinary world, the drab and predictable shapes.” Kimmerer&#39;s personal style instills variety: Each essay provides new information not only about the organisms she&#39;s observing, but also about her many roles within houses, laboratories, and communities. By the end, she has inspired readers to see just as she does, with intimate focus on the smallest parts of life.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/black-writers-environmental-literature-exclusion/672835/">Read: Housekeeping is part of the wild world too</a><br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-rabbit-hutch-tess-gunty/9780593534663?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>The Rabbit Hutch</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Tess Gunty</strong><br><br> Reading a book that really paints a picture of its location feels a bit like traveling from home—you can get to know everything about a place&#39;s history, people, and minutiae. Gunty&#39;s debut novel, <em>The Rabbit Hutch</em> , delivers on this front. A multivoiced story, it follows the many residents of La Lapinière, a low-income apartment complex in Vacca Vale, Indiana, called the Rabbit Hutch by locals. The novel begins when Blandine Watkins, a teenage resident of Apartment C4, is attacked. She thinks of this violence as an “exit” from her body, a phrase that echoes her obsession with the medieval mystic Hildegard von Bingen. From here, the novel works backwards to show what led to that moment, following different occupants of the Rabbit Hutch over one hot week in July: An online-obituary comment moderator irks a celebrity&#39;s son to the point of danger, a mother finally tells her husband she&#39;s afraid of her baby&#39;s eyes, and the three young men Blandine lives with become obsessed with her. It&#39;s a brilliant meditation on how much we don&#39;t know about our nearest neighbors, and how the places we live can bring us together—or tear us apart.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/08/book-recommendations-narrative-tools-setting/671216/">Read: Seven books where the setting exposes the characters</a><br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/possession-a-s-byatt/9780679735908?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Possession</em></strong></a> <strong>, by AS Byatt</strong><br><br> It may feel counterintuitive, but when nothing else can keep my attention, I know it&#39;s time to go long. As opposed to the articles, tweets, and TikToks I see all day, I find that a long novel with a drawn-out structure and pacing—especially a deep dive into several psyches, over some period of time—will always keep me engaged. Plenty of classic novels offer this, but my favorite is Byatt&#39;s <em>Possession</em> , a 1990 novel that adopts aVictorian structure and gives it a postmodern bent. There are two timelines—a contemporary narrative, in which the scholars Roland Michell and Maud Bailey discover letters between two Victorian poets and reconstruct a missing piece of literary history, and a Victorian narrative, in which we see the relationship between those same poets, Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. Woven into these two plots are poems, letters, and excerpts from scholarly books—all masterfully written by Byatt. The two worlds create intense dramatic irony: The reader gets to see both what Michell and Bailey get right and what their archives can never capture, reminding us how unknown the territory of the past truly is. The slow pacing means we get to delve into each perspective, but the book remains thrilling throughout, as a picture of history comes slowly into view. By the end, I find I&#39;m always itching to start reading it again.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 14:21:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/attention-focus-book-recommendations/674941/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/attention-focus-book-recommendations/674941/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Texas Is a Look Into the Future of Driving]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Mindless energy consumption can no longer be the status quo. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OZkBeEXMXgMU_90DVBnsEUdwp9I=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/cars_tx/original.jpg" alt="德克萨斯州高速公路上的汽车照片" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Alyssa Schukar / Redux</figcaption></figure> Every Texan I know has what you might call “grid anxiety,” a low-humming preoccupation with electricity that emerged after brutal winter storms kneecapped the state&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/connecting-past-and-future-history-texas-isolated-power-grid">isolated power grid</a> in February 2021. That frigid disaster triggered highway pileups and runs on grocery stores; people inadvertently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-winter-storms-2021/2021/02/18/969050038/a-disaster-within-a-disaster-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-cases-are-surging-in-texa">poisoned themselves</a> with carbon monoxide by running grills and cars indoors to keep warm. My hometown of San Antonio, like so many places across the state, simply wasn&#39;t equipped to deal with several days of freezing temperatures. Many factors contribute to a disaster of this magnitude, but the fundamental failure of the state&#39;s energy infrastructure can&#39;t be overemphasized.<br><br> Extreme cold is one end of the spectrum. Texas reached the other this summer, as record-breaking <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/south-extreme-heat-wave-texas-climate-change/674598/">heat enveloped the South</a> . Now my conversations with folks back home inevitably lead me to ask, “Is your grid up for this?” So far, the answer has been yes, thanks in part to a substantial expansion of renewable energy, particularly solar power, in the state. But energy is not straightforward: Additional solar capacity will get us only so far if heat waves happen more frequently, and it can be undercut by unfavorable weather or high temperatures that stretch into the night. Experts <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-power-bails-out-texas-grid-during-major-heat-wave/">have said</a> that Texas&#39;s grid is not prepared for the extreme shifts in climate that are still to come. Add to this another complicating factor: Texans need to drive, and more of them are starting to do so in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/texas-electric-vehicle-trends-stats">electric vehicles</a> , which interact with the grid in complex ways. Texas is now the third-largest EV market in the country; registrations have at least doubled since the year of that winter storm to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/texas-surpasses-200k-electric-vehicle-registrations-statewide/#:~:text=Last%20month%2C%20Gov.,most%20passenger%20vehicles%20and%20trucks.">more than 200,000 today</a> —all of them running on an electrical infrastructure that was never designed to power cars. It&#39;s understandable, then, for Texans to ask if the grid is up for <em>that</em> too.<br><br> Even as EVs promise a better climate, many people <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/investigations/defenders/electric-vehicles-texas-power-grid/269-e54f61e6-54dc-40a5-960a-776390736251">assume that these cars will just suck up energy until there&#39;s nothing left</a> , like giant appliances running all day long, causing power plants to work overtime to compensate. And once their batteries are charged, they can struggle under extreme temperatures. Scott Case, the CEO and co-founder of Recurrent, a start-up that delivers reports on battery health for EV buyers, notes that EVs can lose about 30 percent of their range when temperatures go over 100 degrees. “There&#39;s no battery technology that&#39;s going to change physics,” he told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/tesla-charging-stations-ford-gm-nacs/674423/">Read: Tesla&#39;s magic has been reduced to its chargers</a><br><br> With this in mind, Texas is something of a bellwether for a future that many more of us will soon live in as our reliance on electric cars grows, all while temperatures skyrocket permanently upward. You can imagine the nightmare scenario: EVs become a drain on electric grids as the heat gets worse, contributing to widespread blackouts, and then their depleted batteries turn the cars into bricks on wheels. Such a dramatic future may not come to pass, but we will not be able to maintain the status quo: A more extreme climate, combined with the relative complexity of EVs, will require drivers to change their relationship to energy consumption in general, and car manufacturers to reconsider what they build and how.<br><br> The Texas-based electricity giant Vistra is optimistic about what&#39;s next. Emily Stipe, the company&#39;s senior manager for federal and state advocacy, is one of several energy officials seeking to assuage EV-related infrastructure fears as heat becomes more extreme. “We really do believe that the grid will be able to handle the deployment of electric vehicles,” Stipe said during a recent presentation by the nonprofit Zero Emission Transportation Association, or ZETA. But that only happens if multiple parties work together, including “not only the actual EV industry itself, but its supply chain, the electricity providers, and the consumers.”<br><br> Most evidence indicates that EVs won&#39;t put as much strain on grids as people might think. ZETA estimates that in 2021, EVs used just 0.15 percent of total national energy generation. The growth in available energy is far outpacing new demand from EVs, the group says. Even as sales in Texas are steadily growing, “at this time, the loads from EVs are not significant enough to have an impact on the grid,” a spokesperson for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates 90 percent of the state&#39;s electricity network, told me. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/28/texas-heatwave-power-grid-solar-energy">reported doubling</a> of solar power since 2022 has also helped the state&#39;s aging power plants keep the lights on—this despite <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/25/texas-energy-renewables-natural-gas-grid-politics/">considerable opposition to renewables</a> in a place where oil and gas reign supreme. (A greener grid also helps EVs reach their maximum potential for reducing transportation emissions.)<br><br> EVs can also provide benefits many people don&#39;t realize yet. Cars from Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, and others are being designed to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://virta.global/vehicle-to-grid-v2g?__hstc=51530422.6ad426d1409f1436c8073dc60c9478b9.1690253826668.1690253826668.1690253826668.1&amp;__hssc=51530422.12.1690253826668&amp;__hsfp=2924083047&amp;hsutk=6ad426d1409f1436c8073dc60c9478b9&amp;contentType=standard-page&amp;pageId=19739738079#three">return energy to the grid</a> , a technology called bidirectional charging. Whereas the potential energy stored in a gasoline vehicle&#39;s tank can be used only one way, these EVs can help power homes or sell electricity back into the grid. “When you look at what grid resilience is, it&#39;s really the ability for the grid to prepare for and adapt to changing operating conditions,” Chanel Parson, the director of electrification at Southern California Edison, told me. Because EVs only actually drive 5 to 10 percent of the day, she said, “that leaves 21 to 23 hours of a day when a vehicle can discharge its battery to a home or even the grid.”<br><br> This does require “smart grid” upgrades that many utilities are working on right now—all sorts of things, including new transformers, extended power lines, and even better <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.smart-energy.com/digitalisation/cybersecurity/does-v2g-pose-a-cyber-threat-to-the-grid/">cybersecurity</a> . But there&#39;s tremendous potential for battery storage to help on days when solar and wind are weaker; California even staved off blackouts during a crushing heat wave last September thanks to giant batteries connected to the grid, Stipe told me. Often, these are repurposed former EV batteries. “We have seen firsthand the many benefits that energy storage provides, even just beyond emissions-reduction benefits,” she said.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/05/where-are-the-ev-charging-stations/674241/">Read: The one thing holding back electric vehicles in America</a><br><br> Even now, most EVs come with options for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/managed-electric-vehicle-charging.html">smart charging</a> : the ability to manage charging times and levels via the car&#39;s software or the charger&#39;s app. Like a smart thermostat, this allows EV owners to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8oASdb_CjQ">schedule and manage charging for off-peak hours</a> . In other words, you can plug in your EV after you get home from work in the evening but schedule it to charge overnight, when grids aren&#39;t already overworked from heat and the whole family running electricity in the house. This can be done at public chargers too.<br><br> The current world leader in EVs has long played this game. Tesla offers solar tiles and home-energy-storage solutions such as its Powerwall. Now many “traditional” car companies are developing competing products. GM Energy, a new division of General Motors, is rolling out what it calls an “electric ecosystem” for homes and businesses, including solar power, charging, backup batteries, and bidirectional charging technology. “If you&#39;re able to manage the energy, inflow, and outflow, which you could do as a consumer with all of these kinds of pieces, then you have an opportunity to be able to help mitigate some of the issues that come with inclement weather,” Darryll Harrison Jr., a GM spokesperson, told me. These features are expected to roll out with the retail launch of the new Chevrolet Silverado EV, which will begin production later this year.<br><br> The permanent-heat-wave era will change how EVs are built as well. Many automakers are coping with vehicles&#39; range reduction from extreme temperatures by adding new hardware features, such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.moveelectric.com/e-cars/what-heat-pump-and-how-do-they-benefit-electric-cars">heat pumps</a> . Although these are generally seen primarily as a winter-range benefit, their ability to release warm air can greatly improve range in the summer too, Case said. The use of heat pumps, like so many other realities of owning an EV—including monitoring energy usage and figuring out the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/electric-vehicle-rental-cars-hertz-chargers/674429/">best way to charge</a> —will require behavioral changes for drivers who have spent decades just paying for gas and driving away, he said: “Everybody grew up learning how to take care of a combustion-engine car from their parents or their grandparents.” In the nascent EV era, “everyone now is coming up with new rules.”<br><br> Maybe a bigger challenge will be to get drivers, homeowners, and even renters to start thinking differently about their energy use, period. Mindlessly consuming fuel or electricity isn&#39;t a luxury we have anymore. “For many people, they just want their lights to come on when they flick the switch, and they don&#39;t want to think about their electric plan anytime other than their renewal period every year,” Stipe said. “We really need to change that.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 13:25:07 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/electric-vehicle-energy-infrastructure-heat-waves/674940/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/electric-vehicle-energy-infrastructure-heat-waves/674940/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Three Attacks on Intellectual Freedom]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> PEN struggles to reconcile its commitment to social justice with its commitment to free speech. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/RvB3J9O-G-0EMxFw0lNublu9a84=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/PENProtection/original.png" alt="A statue with a quote bubble for a shield" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Paul Spella / The Atlantic; Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> <small><em>Updated at 9:21 pm ET on August 7, 2023</em></small><br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n June 1953</span> , at the height of the McCarthy era, while congressional investigators and private groups were hunting down “subversive” or merely “objectionable” books and authors in the name of national security, the American Library Association and the Association Book Publishers Council issued a manifesto called “The Freedom to Read.” The document defended free expression and denounced censorship and conformity in language whose clarity and force are startling today. It argued for “the widest diversity of views and expressions” and against purging work based on “the personal history or political affiliations of the author.” It urged publishers and librarians to resist government and private suppression, and to “give full meaning to the freedom to read by providing books that enrich the quality and diversity of thought.” The manifesto took on not just official censorship, but the broader atmosphere of coercion and groupthink. It concluded: “We do not state these propositions in the comfortable belief that what people read is unimportant. We believe rather that what people read is deeply important; that ideas can be dangerous; but that the suppression of ideas is fatal to a democratic society. Freedom itself is a dangerous way of life, but it is ours.”<br><br> “The Freedom to Read” was covered in papers and on TV news. President Dwight Eisenhower, who that same month had urged the graduating class of Dartmouth College not to “join the book burners,”&#39; sent a letter of praise to the manifesto&#39;s authors. In one of the darkest periods of American history, the manifesto gave librarians and publishers the courage of their principles. One librarian later wrote, “There developed a fighting profession, made up of dedicated people who were sure of their direction.”<br><br> This past June, the library and publishers&#39; associations <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.slj.com/story/Freedom-to-Read-Statement-Reissued-on-Its-70th-Anniversary#:~:text=On%20the%2070th%20anniversary%20of,statement%20and%20reaffirmed%20its%20message.">reissued</a> “The Freedom to Read” on its 70th anniversary. Scores of publishers, libraries, literary groups, civil-liberty organizations, and authors signed on to endorse its principles. And yet many of those institutional signatories—including the “Big Five” publishing conglomerates—often violate its propositions, perhaps not even aware that they&#39;re doing so. Few of them, if any, could produce as unapologetic a defense of intellectual freedom as the one made at a time when inquisitors were destroying careers and lives. It&#39;s worth asking why the American literary world in 2023 is less able to uphold the principles of “The Freedom to Read” than its authors in 1953.<br><br> The attack on intellectual freedom today is coming from several directions. First—and likely the main concern of the signatories—is an official campaign by governors, state legislatures, local governments, and school boards to weed out books and ideas they don&#39;t like. Most of the targets are politically on the left; most present facts or express views about race, gender, and sexuality that the censors consider dangerous, divisive, obscene, or simply wrong. The effort began in Texas as early as 2020, before public hysteria and political opportunism spread the campaign to Florida and other states, and to every level of education, removing from library shelves and class reading lists several thousand books by writers such as Toni Morrison and Malala Yousafzai.<br><br> Given that states and school districts have a responsibility to set public-school curricula, not all of this can be called government censorship. But laws and policies to prevent students from encountering controversial, unpopular, even offensive writers and ideas amount to a powerfully repressive campaign of book banning, some of it probably unconstitutional. The campaign stems from an American tradition of small-minded panic at rapid change and unorthodox thinking. You can draw a line from Tennessee&#39;s 1925 <em>Scopes</em> trial to Florida&#39;s 2022 Stop WOKE Act. This threat to intellectual freedom is the easiest one for the progressive and enlightened people who predominate in the book world to oppose. No one at Penguin Random House or the National Book Foundation hesitates to stand up for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/books/maia-kobabe-gender-queer-book-ban.html"><em>Gender Queer</em></a> and <em>The Handmaid&#39;s Tale</em> .<br><br> “T <span class="smallcaps">here is more</span> than one way to burn a book,” Ray Bradbury once said. “And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.” The second threat to intellectual freedom comes from a different source—from inside the house. This threat is the subject of a new report that PEN America has just published, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pen.org/report/booklash">Booklash: Literary Freedom, Online Outrage, and the Language of Harm</a> .” (Because I have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/equity-language-guides-sierra-club-banned-words/673085/">written about censorship and language</a> in the past, PEN asked me to read and respond to an earlier draft and gave me an advance copy of the final version.) The report is focused on the recent pattern of publishers and authors canceling their own books, sometimes after publication, under pressure organized online or by members, often younger ones, of their own staffs. PEN has tracked 31 cases of what might be called literary infanticide since 2016; half occurred in just the past two years. “None of these books were withdrawn based on any allegation of factual disinformation, nor glorification of violence, nor plagiarism,” the report notes. “Their content or author was simply deemed offensive.”<br><br> A few cases became big news. Hachette canceled Woody Allen&#39;s autobiography after a staff walkout, and Blake Bailey&#39;s biography of Philip Roth was withdrawn after publication by Norton, both following accusations of sexual misconduct by the authors (Allen and Bailey denied the accusations). Publishers have canceled books following an author&#39;s public remarks—for example, those of the cartoonist Scott Adams, the British journalist Julie Burchill, and the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.<br><br> In one particularly wild case, an author named Natasha Tynes, on the verge of publishing her first novel, a crime thriller, saw a Black employee of the Washington, DC, Metro system eating on a train (a violation of the system&#39;s rules). She tweeted a picture of the woman at the transit authority with a complaint, and immediately found herself transformed into a viral racist. Within hours her distributor, Rare Bird Books, had dropped the novel, tweeting that Tynes “did something truly horrible today.” The publisher, California Coldblood, after trying to wash its hands of the book, eventually went ahead with publication “due to contractual obligations,” but the novel was as good as dead. “How can you expect authors to be these perfect creatures who never commit any faults?” Tynes lamented to PEN. Most publishers now include a boilerplate morals clause in book contracts that legitimizes these cancellations—a loophole that contradicts tenets of “The Freedom to Read” that those publishers endorsed.<br><br> Many of the cases discussed in the report have nothing to do with an author&#39;s offensive statements or bad behavior. Instead, they involve sins of phrasing, characterization, plot, subject matter, or authorial identity. Last year Picador dropped a schoolteacher&#39;s prizewinning memoir when it was attacked for racially insensitive portrayals. A scholarly study of Black feminist culture was withdrawn by Wipf and Stock after critics pointed out that its author was white. Simon &amp; Schuster preemptively killed a biography for children of Hitler because of Hitler. Four young-adult and children&#39;s novels (which seem particularly vulnerable to attack) were pulled for supposedly offensive stories and descriptions. One of them, <em>A Place for Wolves</em> —a novel about two gay American boys set in Kosovo during its war with Serbia—was canceled by its author, Kosoko Jackson, himself a prosecutor of literary offenses via Twitter, after people on social media accused him of violating his own edict about identity placing strict limits on appropriate subject matter: “Stories about the civil rights movement should be written by black people,” he&#39;d tweeted. “Stories of suffrage should be written by women. Ergo, stories about boys during horrific and life changing times, like the AIDS EPIDEMIC, should be written by gay men. Why is this so hard to get?”<br><br> At the heart of these literary autos-da-fé is identity—or, in a phrase the report uses several times, “marginalized identities.” The trip wires that can blow up a writer&#39;s work—charges of “harmful” language, failures of “representation,” “appropriation,” or generally “problematic” content—are all strung along lines of identity. When Jeanine Cummins, a white writer, received a lot attention (and, reportedly, a seven-figure book deal) in 2020 for <em>American Dirt</em> , a novel about a Mexican mother and child on the run from a drug gang, she was denounced for taking an opportunity that should have gone to a Latina author who would, some critics said, have written a better book. Her publisher, Flatiron/Macmillan, didn&#39;t pull the novel—it was selling far too many copies—but it canceled Cummins&#39;s tour, citing safety concerns, and issued an abject statement of self-criticism. The ordeal of <em>American Dirt</em> showed publishers that crossing lines of identity can be dangerous, prompting one former editor, interviewed anonymously by PEN, to ask: “Are we saying that not anyone can write any story? Do you have to have a certain identity? There&#39;s a lot of fear around that.”<br><br> A skeptic might ask why a few dozen awkward decisions and minor controversies out of tens of thousands of books published every year should matter. The answer is that these incidents reveal an atmosphere of conformity and fear that undermines any claim book publishing has to being more than just a business. Most of the canceled books described in the report are victims of a pervasive orthodoxy. At its most rigid, this orthodoxy puts the claims of identity above everything else—literary quality, authorial independence, the freedom to read. Its reach can be seen in how many of the canceled books were already making obvious, if clumsy, efforts to abide by the values of equity and inclusion; and in Natasha Tynes&#39;s attempt to defend herself from online attacks by pleading that she herself is “a minority writer.”<br><br> Eventually, orthodoxy makes the suppression of books unnecessary because it leads to self-censorship by editors and writers. One canceled author interviewed by PEN said, “It has shut me down, creatively. There is always a censor, perched on my shoulder, telling me I cannot write about this or that topic.” What writer can honestly say it isn&#39;t true of them? Almost none of the editors interviewed for the PEN report were willing to be quoted by name. What are they afraid of, if not the fate of their authors?<br><br> Below the waterline lie all the books that aren&#39;t contracted, or even written, because of the examples that become public. In an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-my-new-novel-about-racial-conflict-ran-into-trouble-53a53f54">op-ed for</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-my-new-novel-about-racial-conflict-ran-into-trouble-53a53f54"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> , the best-selling author Richard North Patterson wrote that his latest novel—about an interracial relationship set against battles over voting rights and white racism—was rejected by “roughly 20” New York publishers. “The seemingly dominant sentiment was that only those personally subject to discrimination could be safely allowed to depict it through fictional characters,” Patterson wrote. ( <em>Trial</em> was published in June by a conservative Christian firm in Tennessee and currently ranks around No. 37,000 among all books on Amazon. Several books in the PEN report, canceled by major publishers, were grabbed up by small houses with far less reach.)<br><br> PEN is a free-speech organization. Having already issued a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">lengthy report</a> and numerous statements condemning book banning by state and local governments, it seems to have realized that it could not ignore a pattern of suppression closer to home, by organizations that publish PEN members and sponsor its fundraising galas.<br><br> In May, PEN landed in the middle of its own free-speech controversy when two Ukrainian soldier-writers announced that they would withdraw from the organization&#39;s World Voices Festival if two Russian writers were also included on another panel. Rather than cancel the Ukrainians, who had already arrived in the United States, and send them back home to the war, PEN asked the Russian writers and their panel&#39;s moderator, Masha Gessen, a PEN board member, to speak under a different banner, that of PEN America. The Russians and Gessen instead decided to cancel their own event, and Gessen resigned from the board in protest for what was seen as PEN caving in to the Ukrainians&#39; demands. (One of the Russian writers later said that she did not want to participate if the Ukrainians didn&#39;t want her there.) A month later, PEN declared it “regrettable” and “wrongheaded” when the writer Elizabeth Gilbert suspended publication of her next novel because Ukrainian readers were upset that it was set in Soviet Russia. All of this merely shows that it&#39;s easier to hold a principled position on free speech when you&#39;re not the one facing unpleasant consequences.<br><br> PEN spent months researching and internally debating the new report, anticipating controversy. An early draft was hampered by reflexive hedges and tactical critiques, and a few of them remain in the published report: Accusations of literary harm “risk playing into the hands of book banners” on the right who use the same rhetoric; the publisher of <em>American Dirt</em> might have avoided trouble if it had marketed the novel with more sensitivity.<br><br> The report is an important, even courageous, document in our moment. PEN is offering guidance and backbone for a book trade that appears to have lost its nerve and forgotten its mission in the face of ceaseless outrage. Among its recommendations, the report urges that “publishing houses should rarely, if ever, withdraw books from circulation.” It calls for greater transparency and author involvement in any decisions about cancellations. Goodreads, the online review site, where mobs <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/goodreads-review-bombing-amazon-moderation/674811/">sometimes beat books to death before they&#39;re even finished</a> , let alone published and read, is asked to “encourage authentic reviews” and prevent “review-bombing.”<br><br> These technical fixes would greatly improve policies and procedures in the publishing industry, but they can&#39;t solve the wider problem—a climate of intolerance and cowardice that stifles the book world. In the conclusion to its report, PEN calls for “a broader tonal shift in literary discourse,” which is necessary but probably beyond the power of any report. Essentially, PEN is saying to the remaining gatekeepers, “Remember your purpose,” and to the new gate-crashers, “Don&#39;t use speech to limit speech.” For inspiration it reprints “The Freedom to Read” in full and urges workers in the book world to take it to heart. Ayad Akhtar, the president of PEN America, told me that he hopes publishers will include the 70-year-old manifesto along with DEI training for new hires. PEN wants its report to have an effect similar to that of the earlier document—to make publishing once more “a fighting profession.”<br><br> And yet something holds the report back from using the full-throated language of “The Freedom to Read <em>.</em> ” I think the difficulty lies in an earlier report that PEN published last year.<br><br> In “Reading Between the Lines: Race, Equity, and Book Publishing,” PEN examined in detail how the American book business has always been and, despite recent improvements, remains a clubby world of the white, well connected, and well-off. It presented a damning picture, backed by data, of “the white lens through which writers, editors, and publishers curate America&#39;s literature.” It called for publishers to hire and promote more staff of color, publish more books by writers of color, pay them higher advances, and sell their books more intelligently and vigorously.<br><br> The two reports are related, but the relation is fraught. The first showed the need for an intensified campaign of diversity, equity, and inclusion across the industry. The second argues for greater freedom to defy the literary strictures of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Is there a contradiction between the two?<br><br> PEN doesn&#39;t think so. The new report states: “It is imperative that the literary field chart a course that advances diversity and equity without making these values a cudgel against specific books or writers deemed to fall short in these areas.” In the words of Suzanne Nossel, PEN&#39;s chief executive officer, “You can dismantle the barriers to publication for some without erecting them anew for others.” But this might be wishful thinking, and not only because of practical limits on how many books can feasibly be published. In a different world, it would be entirely possible to expand opportunity without creating a censorious atmosphere. In our world, where DEI has hardened into an ideological litmus test, the effort to place social justice at the center of publishing almost inevitably leads to controversies over “representation” and “harm” that result in banned books. The first report presented DEI in publishing as an urgent moral cause. The second report takes issue with “employees&#39; increasing expectation that publishers assume moral positions in their curation of catalogs and author lists.” But those employees no doubt believe that they are carrying out the vision of the first report.<br><br> Social justice and intellectual freedom are not inherently opposed—often, each requires the other—but they are not the same thing, either. “The Freedom to Read” makes this clear: “It would conflict with the public interest for [publishers and librarians] to establish their own political, moral, or aesthetic views as a standard for determining what should be published or circulated.” That statement was written at a time when the cause of intellectual freedom was non- or even anti-ideological. Its authors advocated no other goal than the widest and highest-quality expression of views. But in PEN&#39;s new report you can feel a struggle to reconcile the thinking of its earlier one, in which every calculation comes down to identity, with the discriminating judgment and openness to new and disturbing ideas that are essential to producing literature. As one editor told me, “There&#39;s no equity in talent.”<br><br> Last year, a federal judge blocked a bid by Penguin Random House, the largest publisher in America, to buy Simon &amp; Schuster, the third largest (a takeover would have practically made the conglomerate a sovereign country). This year, book sales are down across the industry, bringing waves of layoffs; last month, senior editors at Penguin Random House were given the option of a buyout under the shadow of termination, and some of the most illustrious gatekeepers in publishing headed for the door. These events bring me to the third and most serious attack on the written word.<br><br> This one is more insidious and pervasive and therefore harder to see clearly, let alone oppose, than book bans and cancellations. It&#39;s the air every writer and reader breathes: the consolidation of publishing into a near-monopoly business; the correspondent shrinking of heterodoxy and risk taking; the fragile economic situation of employees; the withering away of bookstores and book reviews; the growing illiteracy of the public; the decline of English instruction in schools, regardless of political pressures; the data crunching that turns ideas into machine-made products and media into highly sensitive barometers of popularity (with artificial intelligence coming soon to replace the last traces of human originality). All of these trends amount to an assault on the free intellect perpetrated not by Moms for Liberty or YA Twitter, but by Mark Zuckerberg, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Amazon. In a sense, this third attack underlies the other two, because strong emotions and extreme language are programmed into the brains of book banners of every type by algorithms that profit a handful of technology and media giants.<br><br> Literature and journalism have never been remunerative fields. But compared with three decades ago, the chances of a serious, sustained career today are far slimmer. I can&#39;t help thinking that these circumstances have something to do with the willingness of publishers to be frightened by a few hundred tweets. Perhaps years of consolidation and precarity have so weakened their conviction in the mission of book publishing that a little outrage online and in house is sufficient to erase it. If the editor&#39;s function is to match the identity of writer and subject matter, then gather data to measure the success of the product, perhaps gatekeepers have finally outlived their usefulness.<br><br> <em><small>This article previously misstated Suzanne Nossel&#39;s title at PEN America.</small></em><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 11:31:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/freedom-to-read-pen-america-censorship/674936/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/freedom-to-read-pen-america-censorship/674936/</item><item><title><![CDATA[The Burden of Proof Is on the Language Police]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Claims that specific terms hurt people should be evaluated in a rigorous way—not based only on hunches. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Yh_Ri7MpSMGvKtZxMP9uBhVAl9Q=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/language_horz_1/original.jpg" alt="An illustration of a speech bubble made of barbed wire" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> In my work as a senior editor at a scientific journal, the most challenging arguments I mediate among reviewers, authors, other editors, and readers are not about research methods, empirical data, or subtle points of theory but about which terms describing vulnerable groups are acceptable and which are harmful. My field—addiction and drug policy—has a tradition of savage infighting over language. Are the people whom earlier generations derided as <i>vagrants</i> or <i>bums</i> more appropriately termed <i>homeless people</i> , <i>people who are homeless</i> , <i>unsheltered persons</i> , <i>persons with lived experience of being unhoused</i> , or something else? Similar arguments erupt in politics, in journalism, in the classroom, in the workplace, and between generations at the dinner table. When even sincere, well-intended people cannot agree on which words reinforce social injustice and damage human well-being, the debates can be mutually bruising.<br><br> Sometimes the arguments resolve themselves over time, and plainly pejorative words such as <i>crackhead</i> and <i>junkie</i> vanish unlamented from the public discourse. To their credit, scholars who study and treat addiction are keenly aware of how negative language can instill negative public attitudes that turn public policy against people with drug- and alcohol-use disorders. That said, any claim that specific terms are actively harmful should be viewed as a hypothesis until it is established as fact. When confronted with claims that term <i>X</i> causes harm to people with a given characteristic, or that term <i>Y</i> is the only way to describe them respectfully, a fair-minded person can reasonably respond, “What evidence suggests that this is true?”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/brandeis-language-police-have-suggestions-you/619347/">John McWhorter: Even <i>trigger warning</i> is now off-limits</a><br><br> To be sure, when someone expresses clear preferences about how he or she wants to be described, that wish requires no evidentiary validation. In some cases, honoring other people&#39;s self-conception may mean tolerating language that well-meaning outsiders view as blunt, impolite, or even destructive. For example, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-about-addiction/201809/never-call-someone-alcoholic-or-addict">some members of my field think</a> people in recovery shouldn&#39;t burden themselves with the terms <i>addicts</i> and <i>alcoholics</i> —words that could very well stigmatize anyone labeled as such without their consent but that are widely claimed by participants in 12-step programs. Scientists and clinicians must show respect to other people&#39;s humanity, and that includes upholding their right to speak for and define themselves.<br><br> To ask for evidence when a term is asserted to be harmful will strike some people as mere resistance to change. In fact, quite a bit of evidence on the effects of terminology is available to guide us, and in some cases, it backs up a linguistic shift. According to one study in my field, seeing an individual described as a <i>substance abuser</i> rather than as <i>having a</i> <i>substance-use disorder</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002204261004000403">makes people more likely to view them as a safety threat and as deserving of punishment</a> . Some terms are called harmful because that is demonstrably what they are.<br><br> But many other claims about the harmfulness or virtue of individual terms lack clear evidence, and we should therefore be humble in generalizing. The best evidence for why experts and policy makers should tolerate a broad range of terminology is the demonstrated diversity in what groups of people prefer to be called. One day, a white American colleague chastised me for using the allegedly demeaning term <i>elder</i> when discussing drug overdoses among Medicare participants, shortly before I got on a Zoom call in which Canadian colleagues of Indigenous ancestry repeatedly used the same term as a sign of respect for the longest-lived members of their community. During my clinical training as a psychologist, I was informed (without evidence) that <i>patient</i> was a destructively medicalized term for people seeking mental-health care, and that I should use only <i>client</i> . But surveys of real-life people seeking care show no consensus. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/handle/2299/5733">one study</a> , individuals seeing a psychiatrist or a nurse, for example, preferred <i>patients</i> , whereas <i>patients</i> and <i>clients</i> were equally popular among those consulting a social worker or an occupational therapist. Acceptance of other terms—including <i>service users</i> , <i>people who use services</i> , and <i>consumers</i> —varies considerably. In short, there is no single ideal term, and the search for one founders on the reality that individuals with the same condition routinely differ about what they wish to be called.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/equity-language-guides-sierra-club-banned-words/673085/">From the April 2023 issue: The moral case against equity language</a><br><br> Ironically, the impulse to promote equity through new terminology fails in some cases to take account of individual and cultural diversity. Many US academics quickly adopted the neologism <i>Latinx</i> as a more inclusive, gender-neutral alternative to <i>Hispanic</i> or <i>Latino</i> , even though the term bemuses or annoys some people of Latin American descent and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2020/08/11/about-one-in-four-u-s-hispanics-have-heard-of-latinx-but-just-3-use-it/">survey data</a> suggest that few use it to describe themselves. The impact of other language meant to lessen social stigma is not always clear. In the United States, <i>homeless</i> has fallen into disrepute in some quarters, but whether people without reliable shelter benefit from or prefer to use the ostensibly more egalitarian <i>unhoused</i> or <i>houseless</i> remains to be demonstrated. Good intentions sometimes yield bulky terms that are soon collapsed into acronyms. <i>Person with alcohol-use disorder</i> may have some humanizing potential, but whether abbreviating the term as <i>PWAUD</i> , as many academic papers do, has the desired effect is a matter of conjecture.<br><br> Denouncing other people&#39;s terminology as harmful, and demanding that others adopt your own, can be intoxicating—to the point that submitting such disputes to empirical tests can feel like a bit of a comedown. But making these judgments in a rigorous, fact-based way would prevent experts, policy makers, and the general public from being distracted by something easy—arguing about words—when we need to focus on doing something much harder: solving massive social problems. A shared commitment to evidence provides a way to resolve upsetting disagreements that can otherwise fester forever, while opening up chances to learn when we have in fact caused harm and genuinely need to treat others better.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/addiction-drug-policy-language-harm-evidence/674907/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/addiction-drug-policy-language-harm-evidence/674907/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Here Comes the Second Year of AI College]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Universities still aren&#39;t sure whether to embrace the technology or ban it. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/4lFQlZq-m5haSSvNy5GZSNgvFeM=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/ai_college_2/original.jpg" alt="An old-school computer-generated image of a graduation cap" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> W <span class="smallcaps">hen ChatGPT entered the world</span> last fall, the faculty at SUNY Buffalo freaked out. Kelly Ahuna, the university&#39;s director of academic integrity, was inundated by panicked emails. “It has me thinking about retiring,” one English professor confessed. He had typed a prompt into ChatGPT and watched in horror as an essay unfurled on-screen. There were errors, sure: incorrect citations, weird transitions. But he would have given it a B-minus. He anticipated an onslaught of undetectable AI plagiarism. Ahuna found herself as something of a spiritual mentor, guiding faculty through their existential angst about artificial intelligence.<br><br> The first year of AI college was marked by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/chatbot-cheating-college-campuses/674073/">mayhem and mistrust</a> . Educational institutions, accustomed to moving very slowly, for the most part failed to issue clear guidance. In this vacuum, professors grew suspicious of students who turned in particularly grammatical essays. Plagiarism detectors flagged legitimate work as AI-generated. Over the summer, some universities and colleges have regrouped; they&#39;re trying to embrace AI at the institutional level, incorporating it into curriculum and helping instructors adapt. But the norm is still to let individual educators fend for themselves—and some of those individuals seem to believe that they can keep teaching as if generative AI didn&#39;t exist.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/chatbot-cheating-college-campuses/674073/">Read: The first year of AI college ends in ruin</a><br><br> Modernizing higher education is a formidable task. I graduated from college this past spring. Before the pandemic, my professors insisted that we print assignments out and hand them in—forget submitting online. Although ChatGPT was available for nearly my entire senior year, the university administration sent out only one announcement about it, encouraging faculty to understand the implications of the technology. My friends, meanwhile, talked incessantly about it. I don&#39;t know anyone who wrote an entire paper with ChatGPT—or who would admit to it, at least—but people used it in other ways. Some asked it to generate practice-exam questions for them to solve. Others turned to it for help with their philosophy reading, asking the chatbot to explain, say, Parfit&#39;s definition of a self-effacing theory. One of my friends asked ChatGPT how to get over her ex-boyfriend. (The advice was generic but excellent.) But only one of my professors ever mentioned it: Halfway through the spring semester, my computer-science professor announced that we couldn&#39;t use ChatGPT to complete our codes. Then he said he would rely on the honor system.<br><br> Heading into the second year of AI college, some institutions are trying to develop a less technophobic approach. According to Kathe Pelletier, a director at the tech-focused education nonprofit Educause, the most enthusiastic AI adopters tend to be public universities or community colleges that serve large, diverse student bodies and see education as a means of social mobility. Arizona State University is piloting an introductory writing course in which an AI bot offers feedback on students&#39; work. The class is taught to remote learners at a low cost, and the AI could allow for something like peer feedback for students who take classes alone, on their own schedule. Administrators at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville have organized a professor-led task force to suggest different ways for faculty to add generative AI to the classroom. The University of Florida launched a $70 million AI initiative in 2020 with funding from the chip-manufacturing giant Nvidia. Sid Dobrin, an English professor who is part of the initiative, says that it will sponsor a competition this year in which students can win prize money for the most creative use of generative text or image AI. These schools are preparing to feed employers&#39; hunger for AI-savvy graduates. “I always say: You are not going to lose your job to AI,” Dobrin told me. “You are going to lose your job to somebody who understands how to use AI.”<br><br> Other universities, however, still have no overarching institutional posture toward AI. Administrators are wary of announcing policies that could age poorly. Professors are left to figure out how to leverage the technology on their own. In its defense, this stance preserves academic autonomy and encourages experimentation. For example, the teacher of Harvard&#39;s introductory computer-science course deployed a teaching-assistant chatbot this summer built based on OpenAI&#39;s code. But the hands-off institutional approach also forces instructors, many of whom have yet to master the “Mute” button on Zoom, to be at the vanguard of a technology that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt-gpt-4/674764/">isn&#39;t fully understood</a> even by the people who created it. In a recent informal <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2023/4/educause-quickpoll-results-adopting-and-adapting-to-generative-ai-in-higher-ed-tech">poll</a> by Educause, 40 percent of respondents said that they weren&#39;t aware of anyone at their institution taking responsibility for decisions around how generative AI should be used. “A president or provost is thinking, <em>Should I jump on this only to have it become the most unpopular thing in the world?</em> ” Bryan Alexander, who teaches at Georgetown University&#39;s school of learning, design, and technology, says.<br><br> Some academics have been eager to add the alien technology to their classroom. Ted Underwood, who teaches English and information science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says that every student should learn the basics of AI ethics. He likens the topic to the tenets of democracy, which even people who won&#39;t pursue political science need to understand. Other professors see AI as a way to enliven instruction. The new introductory writing course at the University of Utah asks students to compare sonnets written by William Shakespeare, Pablo Neruda, and ChatGPT; professors say that using an AI bot is the easiest way to generate usefully bad poems.<br><br> Another faction within academia sees generative AI as an enemy. In the age of large language models, a student&#39;s writing assignment can no longer reliably confirm whether they&#39;ve understood a topic or read a text. Weekly reading responses and discussion posts, once a staple of higher education, seem useless. Some instructors are trying to adopt countermeasures. One SUNY Buffalo faculty member told Kelly Ahuna that he would keep his weekly online quizzes but employ technology that tracks students&#39; eye movements to detect potential cheating. Others seem to hope that prohibition alone can preserve the familiar pre-ChatGPT world. Most instructors at Bryn Mawr College have declared that any use of AI tools counts as plagiarism, says Carlee Warfield, the head of the school&#39;s honor board. Darren Hick, a philosophy professor at Furman University, told me he refuses to abandon take-home essays. In his view, in-person exams aren&#39;t real philosophy. They leave no time for rumination and serious engagement with a thinker&#39;s work. “It&#39;s gimmicky,” Hick said. “My pedagogy is good, my students learn, and I don&#39;t like the idea of having to upend what&#39;s been a tradition in philosophy for millennia because somebody has a new technology that students can use to cheat.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-ai-writing-college-student-essays/672371/">Read: The college essay is dead</a><br><br> Many of the professors and administrators I spoke with likened generative AI to earlier waves of technological change; perhaps an analogy offered perspective and solace when confronting something so mystifying. They compared it to Wikipedia (riddled with inaccuracies), to calculators (students still learn long division), and even to microwave dinners (ChatGPT&#39;s writing is a frozen meat loaf; a student essay is a marbled steak).<br><br> But the most common comparison was to the advent of the internet. Charles Isbell, the dean of computing at Georgia Tech, points out that the web did not immediately create the kind of nightmarish scenario that people had predicted. Supersonic email exchanges didn&#39;t <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/22/text.iq/">scramble our brains</a> , just as the “Undo” button hasn&#39;t <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/humanity-has-always-feared-technology-in-the-21st-century-are-we-right-to-be-afraid/">eroded our sense of consequence</a> . For now, Isbell isn&#39;t concerned about students cheating with AI: If they submit a ChatGPT-written essay, the errors will give them away, and if they try to avoid detection by meticulously fact-checking the chatbot&#39;s writing, they&#39;ll learn the material. But just like the internet, which spawned smartphones and social-media sites that few people could have foreseen, AI will undercut the most basic patterns in higher education. “It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to hold in your head both thoughts,” Isbell told me. “It&#39;s not going to be the big, destructive force that we think it&#39;s going to be anytime soon. Also, higher education will be completely unrecognizable in 15 years because of this technology. We just don&#39;t really know how.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/ai-chatgpt-college-essay-plagiarism/674928/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/ai-chatgpt-college-essay-plagiarism/674928/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ones We Sent Away]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> I thought my mother was an only child.

It&#39;s the summer of 2021. My husband wanders into the kitchen and asks whether I&#39;ve seen<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/RoseUnwin/status/1429941550881124353">the post from the English theater director</a> that has been whipping around Twitter, the one featuring a photograph of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/15/stephen-unwin-son-joey-learning-disability">his nonverbal son</a> . I have not. I head up the stairs to my computer. “How will I find it?” I shout.<br><br> “You&#39;ll find it,” he tells me.<br><br> I do, within a matter of seconds: a picture of Joey Unwin, smiling gently for the camera, his bare calves and sandaled toes a few steps from an inlet by the sea. Perhaps you, too, have seen this photo? His father, Stephen, surely did not intend it to become the sensation it did—he wasn&#39;t being political, wasn&#39;t playing to the groundlings. “Joey is 25 today,” he wrote. “He&#39;s never said a word in his life, but has taught me so much more than I&#39;ve ever taught him.”<br><br> That this earnest, heartfelt tweet has been liked some 80,000 times and retweeted more than 2,600 is already striking. But even more so is the cascade of replies: scores of photographs from parents of non- and minimally verbal children from all over the world. Some of the kids are young and some are old; some hold pets and some sit on swings; some grin broadly and some affect a more serious, thoughtful air. One is proudly holding a tray of Yorkshire pudding he&#39;s baked. Another is spooning his mom on a picnic blanket.<br><br> I spend nearly an hour, just scrolling. I am only partway through when I realize my husband hasn&#39;t steered me toward this outpouring simply because it&#39;s an atypical Twitter moment, suffused with the sincere and the personal. It&#39;s because he recognizes that to me, the tweet and downrush of replies <i>are</i> personal.<br><br> He knows that I have an aunt whom no one speaks about and who herself barely speaks. She is, at the time of this tweet, 70 years old and living in a group home in upstate New York. I have met her just once. Before this very moment, in fact, I have forgotten she exists at all.<br><br> It is extraordinary what we hide from ourselves—and even more extraordinary that we once hid her, my mother&#39;s <i>sister</i> , and so many like her from everyone. Here are all these pictures of nonverbal children, so pulsingly alive—their parents describing their pleasures, their passions, their strengths and styles and tastes—while I know nothing, absolutely nothing, of my aunt&#39;s life at all. She is a thinning shadow, an aging ghost.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">When I first discovered</span> that my mother had a younger sister, I reacted as if I&#39;d been told about the existence of a new planet. This fact at once astonished me and made an eerie kind of sense, suddenly explaining the gravitational force that had invisibly arranged my family&#39;s movements and behaviors for years. Now I understood why my grandfather spent so many hours in retirement as a volunteer at the Westchester Association for Retarded Citizens. Now I understood my grandmother&#39;s annual trips to the local department store to buy Christmas presents, although we were Jewish. (At the time, my aunt lived in a group home where the residents were taken to church every Sunday.)<br><br> I now even understood, perhaps, the flickers of melancholy I would see in my grandmother, an otherwise buoyant and intrepid personality, charming and sly and full of wit.<br><br> And my mom: Where do you start with my mom? For almost two years, she had a sister. Then, at the age of 6 and a half, she watched as her only sibling, almost five years younger, was spirited away. It would be 40 years before she saw her again.<br><br> Strange how seldom we think about who our parents were as people before we made their acquaintance—all the dynamics and influences that shaped them, the defining traumas and triumphs of their early lives. Yet how are we to know them, really, if we don&#39;t? And show them compassion and understanding as they age?<br><br> I was 12 when I learned. My mother and I were sitting at the kitchen table when I wondered aloud what I&#39;d do if I ever had a disabled child. This provided her with an opening.<br><br> <i>Her name is Adele.</i><br><br> She had red hair, I was told. Weird: Who in our family had red hair? (Actually, my great-grandmother, but I knew her only as a white-haired battle-ax dedicated in equal measure to her soap operas and cigarettes.) She is <i>profoundly retarded</i> , my mother explained. There had been no language revolution back then. This was the proper descriptor, found in textbooks and doctors&#39; charts. My mother elaborated that the bones in Adele&#39;s head had knitted together far too early when she was a baby. So, a smaller brain. It was only when I met her 16 years later that I understood the physical implications of this: a markedly smaller head.<br><br> It was staggering to meet someone who looked just like my mother, but with red hair and a much smaller head.<br><br> My grandmother told my mother that she instantly knew something was different when Adele was born. Her cry wasn&#39;t like other babies&#39;. She was inconsolable, had to be carried everywhere. Her family doctor said nonsense, Adele was fine. For an entire year, he maintained that she was fine, even though, at the age of 1, she couldn&#39;t hold a bottle and didn&#39;t respond to the stimuli that other toddlers do. I can&#39;t imagine what this casual brush-off must have done to my grandmother, who knew, in some back cavern of her heart, that her daughter was not the same as other children. But it was 1952, the summer that Adele turned 1. What male doctor took a working-class woman without a college education seriously in 1952?<br><br> Only when my mother and her family went to the Catskills that same summer did a doctor finally offer a very different diagnosis. My grandmother had gone to see this local fellow not because Adele was sick, but because <i>she</i> was; Adele had merely come along. But whatever ailed my grandmother didn&#39;t capture this man&#39;s attention. Her daughter did. He took one look at her and demanded to know whether my aunt was getting the care she required.<br><br> What did he mean?<br><br> “That child is a microcephalic idiot.”<br><br> My grandmother told this story to my mother, word for word, more than four decades later.<br><br> In March of 1953, my grandparents took Adele, all of 21 months, to Willowbrook State School. It would be many years before I learned exactly what that name meant, years before I learned what kind of gothic mansion of horrors it was. And my mother, who didn&#39;t know how to explain what on earth had happened, began telling people that she was an only child.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is the fall</span> of 2021. My aunt lives in a uniquely unlovely part of upstate New York, a dreary grayscape of strip malls and Pizza Huts and liquor stores. But her group home is a snuggery of overstuffed furniture, flowers, family photos; the outside is framed by an actual white picket fence. It is precisely the kind of home you would hope that your aunt, abandoned to an institution through a cruel accident of timing and gravely misplaced ideas, would find herself in as she ages. When my mother and I arrive to see her, she is waiting for us at the door.<br><br> The drive to this house was 90 minutes from where my folks live in northern Westchester. Yet the car ride yielded just 29 minutes and 15 seconds of recorded conversation with my mother. This could partly be explained by the unfamiliar directions in her GPS, but still: Here she was, visiting the sister she hadn&#39;t seen since 1998—and then only twice before that, in 1993, shortly after her father died—and she had almost nothing to say about where we were headed or what the weather was like inside her head. She seemed far more interested in telling me about the necklaces she was making and selling to support Hadassah, one of her favorite charities. Whether this was out of anxiety or enthusiasm, I didn&#39;t know.<br><br> “Are you feeling nervous about seeing her?” I finally asked.<br><br> “No.”<br><br> “Really? Why not? <i>I&#39;m</i> nervous.”<br><br> “Why are you nervous?”<br><br> “Why are you <i>not</i> nervous?”<br><br> “Because I made peace with my separation from her many, many years ago.”<br><br> My grandparents, for their part, had visited my aunt almost every week, at least when she was young. Even after my grandmother moved to Florida, she made an effort to visit once a year. When I was in my late teens or early 20s, I remember my mother telling me that Adele never knew or understood who my grandmother was, not ever. This fact stuck with me—and hit me especially hard when I became a mother myself. As we were humming along the Taconic State Parkway, I reconfirmed: Adele didn&#39;t recognize her own mother?<br><br> “No,” she said. “She didn&#39;t know her. She didn&#39;t understand the concept of a mother.”<br><br> But when my mother last saw her sister, in 1998, it wasn&#39;t my grandmother who accompanied her. It was me. The whole trip had been at my instigation, just like this one. I&#39;d mentioned that I was interested in meeting my aunt, and my mother had stunned me then, just as she&#39;d stunned me now, by saying, “Why don&#39;t we go together?”<br><br> And what do I remember of that singular day? How uncharacteristically animated and affectionate my mother was when she saw Adele, for one thing. You could almost discern the outlines of the little girl she&#39;d been, the one who would circle Adele&#39;s crib and play a made-up game she called “Here, Baby.” Also, how petite my aunt was—4 foot 8, dumpling-shaped—and how slack the musculature was around her jaw, which may have had something to do with the fact that my aunt had no teeth. She had supposedly taken a medication that had made them decay, though there&#39;s really no way to know.<br><br> But what stayed with me most from that day—what I thought about for years afterward—were the needlepoint canvases marching along the walls in Adele&#39;s bedroom. My mother and I both gasped when we saw them. My mother, too, was an avid needlepointer in those years, undertaking almost comically ambitious projects—the Chagall windows, the Unicorn Tapestries. Adele&#39;s handiwork was simpler, cruder, but there it was, betokening the same passion, the same obsession.<br><br> One other thing: My mother and I discovered that day that Adele could carry a tune—and when she sang, she suddenly had hundreds of words at her disposal, not just <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i> , the only two words we heard her speak. Again, we were amazed. For years, my mother was a pianist and studied opera; her technical skills were impeccable, her sight-reading was impeccable, her ear was impeccable. She could pick up the telephone and tell you that the dial tone was a major third.<br><br> My mother couldn&#39;t get over it—the needlepoints, the singing.<br><br> I felt like I was staring at some kind of photonegative of a twin study.<br><br> So here we are, 23 years later, and Adele is greeting us at the door. She is wearing a bright-red sweater. There is my mother at the door. She, too, is wearing a bright-red sweater. Adele is wearing a long, chunky beaded necklace she has recently made at her day program. And my mother, like her sister, is wearing a long, chunky beaded necklace she has recently made—not at a day program, obviously, but for Hadassah. It turns out that Adele loves making necklaces and has whole drawers of them. As, lately, does my mother.<br><br> I have a picture of the two of them standing side by side that day. I cannot stop looking at it.<br><br> Carmen Ayala, Adele&#39;s extraordinary 79-year-old caretaker, has instructed Adele to say “Hello, Rona, I love you” to my mother, a gesture that&#39;s both sweet and awkward—Adele doesn&#39;t know my mother by sight, much less by name. Still, it catches my mother by surprise, not least because it suggests that her sister&#39;s vocabulary has expanded considerably since we last saw her, when she was living in a different group home. They embrace and take seats on the couch in the living room. We try, for a time, to ask Adele basic questions about her day, without much success, though when we ask if she knows any Christmas carols—the holiday is coming up—she sings “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” for us, and my mother replies in kind with “Silent Night.” Then Adele zones out, staring at her hands. She can spend hours staring at her hands.<br><br> My mother and I start to ask Carmen and her youngest child, Evelyn—she lives nearby and knows well all three residents in her parents&#39; home—the customary questions: How did Carmen get into this line of work? What is Adele&#39;s routine? How did Adele handle the transition to Carmen&#39;s house 22 years ago, after her previous caretaker retired? And although I&#39;m interested in the answers, I find myself growing restless, thoughts of that Twitter thread plucking at my consciousness. I finally blurt out: What is my aunt <i>like</i> ?<br><br> Evelyn replies first. “Very meticulous,” she says. “She needs things a certain way, and she will correct you the minute you do something wrong.”<br><br> I stare at my mother, who says nothing. I turn back to Evelyn and Carmen and prompt them. Such as?<br><br> Her clothes have to match, they say, down to the underwear. She keeps her bed pin-neat.<br><br> “She knows where everything is at,” Evelyn continues. “If we”—meaning her or any of her family members—“come here and we are washing a dish and we put it in the wrong place, she will tell us, <i>Nope</i> .”<br><br> I stare at my mother expectantly. Still nothing.<br><br> “Like, <i>That doesn&#39;t go there</i> ,” Evelyn explains.<br><br> At this point, my mother pipes up. “I don&#39;t let anyone else load the dishwasher.”<br><br> Finally.<br><br> “That&#39;s Adele,” Evelyn says.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Arthur Miller&#39;s youngest son</span> , Daniel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/09/miller200709">was institutionalized</a> . He was born with Down syndrome in 1966 and sent to Southbury Training School, in Connecticut, when he was about 4 years old. Miller never once mentioned him in his memoir <i>Timebends</i> , and Miller&#39;s <i>New York Times</i> obituary said not one word about him, naming three children, rather than four.<br><br> Erik Erikson, the storied developmental psychologist, also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/08/22/reviews/990822.22edmundt.html">put his son with Down syndrome in an institution</a> . He and his wife, Joan, told their other three children that their brother died shortly after he was born in 1944. They eventually told all three the truth, but not at the same time. Their oldest son learned first. That must have been quite a secret to keep.<br><br> It is astonishing how many Americans have relations who were, at some point during the past century, sequestered from public view. They were warehoused, disappeared, roughly shorn from the family tree.<br><br> Pearl S. Buck, the Nobel Prize winner for literature and author of <i>The Good Earth</i> , institutionalized her 9-year-old daughter, Carol, likely in 1929. But Buck was different: She regularly visited her daughter, and 21 years later had the courage to write about her experience in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-child-who-never-grew-a-memoir-pearl-s-buck/9781504047968?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Child Who Never Grew</i></a> .<br><br> It is remarkable how many Americans have relations who were, at some point during the past century, sequestered from public view. They were warehoused, disappeared, roughly shorn from the family tree. “Delineated” is how the Georgetown disability-studies scholar Jennifer Natalya Fink puts it, meaning denied their proper place in their ancestral lineage.<br><br> With time, we would learn the terrible toll that institutionalization took on those individuals. But they weren&#39;t the only ones who paid a price, Fink argues. So did their parents, their siblings, future generations. In hiding our disabled relations, she writes in her book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/all-our-families-disability-lineage-and-the-future-of-kinship-jennifer-natalya-fink/9780807008133?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>All Our Families</i></a> , we as a culture came to view disability “as an individual trauma to a singular family, rather than a common, collective, and normal experience of all families.”<br><br> This is precisely what happened to Fink. When her daughter was diagnosed with autism at 2 and a half, Fink was devastated, despite her liberal politics and enlightened attitude toward neurodiversity. Then she realized that the only disabled person she knew about in her family was a relative who&#39;d been institutionalized in the early &#39;70s. This sent her on a journey to learn more about him—and in so doing, she discovered yet another disabled family member, in Scotland. Had she known far more about them—had they been an integral part of family discussions and photo albums (and, in the case of the American relative, family events)—she would have had a far richer, more expansive understanding of her ancestry; her own child&#39;s disability would have seemed like “part of the warp and woof of our lineage,” as she writes, rather than an exception.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/10/autisms-first-child/308227/">From the October 2010 issue: Autism&#39;s first child</a><br><br> It occurred to me that this may have been one of my unconscious motives in trying to get to know Adele at such a late stage of my own life, in addition to simple curiosity about a lost relative. It would be a minor act of restitution, of relineation. Without any malevolent intent, we&#39;d all colluded in one woman&#39;s erasure. And our entire family had been the poorer for it.<br><br> Mass institutionalization wasn&#39;t always the norm in the United States. During the colonial era, people with developmental and intellectual disabilities were integrated into most communities; in the early 1800s, with the advent of asylums and special schools, American educators hoped some could be cured and quickly returned to mainstream society.<br><br> But by the late 19th century, it became clear that intellectual disabilities couldn&#39;t be vanquished simply by sending people to the right schools or asylums, and once the eugenics movement captured the public&#39;s imagination, the fate of the country&#39;s intellectually and developmentally disabled was sealed. “Undesirables” and “defectives” weren&#39;t just institutionalized; they became the involuntary subjects of medical experiments, waking from mysterious surgeries to discover that they could no longer have children.<br><br> Cue the line from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/274us200"><i>Buck v. Bell</i> , the infamous 1927 Supreme Court case</a> that upheld a Virginia statute permitting the sterilization of the so-called intellectually unfit: “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”<br><br> Then the postwar era came along, with its apron-clad mothers and gray-flanneled fathers and all-around emphasis on a certain species of Americanness, a certain norm. “I&#39;m speaking in huge generalities here,” says Kim E. Nielsen, the author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/a-disability-history-of-the-united-states-kim-e-nielsen/9780807022047?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>A Disability History of the United States</i></a> , “but I think that push for social conformity exacerbated the incredible shame folks had about family members with intellectual and physical disabilities.” Institutionalizing such family members often became the most attractive—or viable—option. The stigma associated with having a different sort of child was too great; too often, schools wouldn&#39;t have them, state-subsidized therapies weren&#39;t available to them, and churches wouldn&#39;t come to their aid. “There were no support structures at all,” Nielsen told me. “It was almost the opposite. There were <i>anti</i> -support structures.”<br><br> My aunt was born in that postwar period. But I don&#39;t think my grandparents were capitulating to social pressure when they institutionalized Adele. They were simply listening to the advice of their doctors, authoritative men with white coats and granite faces who told them there was no point in keeping their daughter at home. According to my mother, my grandparents ferried Adele from one specialist to another, each declaring that she would never walk, never talk, never outgrow her diapers.<br><br> Which raised a question, on further reflection: Did my aunt&#39;s condition have a name? As we were driving along, my mother told me she didn&#39;t know; Adele had never had genetic testing.<br><br>真的吗？ I asked. Even now? In the 2020s?<br><br> Really.<br><br> My grandparents are no longer with us. I know little of what they were told or how they felt when they were advised to send their second child away. But I imagine the script sounded similar to what a physician told Pearl S. Buck when she took Carol to the Mayo Clinic. “This child will be a burden on you all your life,” he said, according to Buck&#39;s memoir. “Do not let her absorb you. Find a place where she can be happy and leave her there and live your own life.” She did as she was told. But it violated every ounce of her maternal intuition. “Perhaps the best way to put it,” she wrote, “is that I felt as though I were bleeding inwardly and desperately.”<br><br> “The parents who institutionalized their children—they too are survivors of institutionalization and victims of it,” Fink told me. “They were broken by this. It was not presented as a choice, for the most part. And even when it was, the medical establishment made it seem like institutionalization was the <i>best</i> choice.”<br><br> That applied to my grandmother, a tower of resilience, a woman who survived her father&#39;s suicide, a brutal knife attack by a madman in a public restroom, and breast cancer at a relatively young age. She, like Buck, bled inwardly and desperately, in the most literal sense, developing an ulcer when my mom was 11 or 12. “Before Grandma died, she started talking about Adele, and for the first time that I can remember, she admitted that she felt terrible institutionalizing her,” my mother told me as we drove. “When I reminded her that if she had not institutionalized her, nobody in the family would&#39;ve had a normal life, she said, &#39;Yes, but she would&#39;ve been with people who loved her.&#39; ”<br><br> One of the beneficiaries of that so-called normal life was, ostensibly, my mother. In his magisterial <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/far-from-the-tree-parents-children-and-the-search-for-identity-andrew-solomon/9780743236720?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Far From the Tree</i></a> , the writer Andrew Solomon notes that the most commonly cited rationale for institutionalization in those years was that neurotypical siblings would suffer—from shame, from attention starvation—if their disabled siblings were kept at home.<br><br> But it&#39;s more complicated than that, isn&#39;t it? My mother has never in her life uttered a cross word about her parents&#39; decision, and she&#39;s hardly the sort to play the victim—she may have been trained as an opera singer, but she&#39;s the least divalike person I know. Yet when I asked her what it was like when Adele left the house, she reflexively confirmed Fink&#39;s hypothesis: She suffered. “It was like I lost an arm or a leg,” she said.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/phantom-twin/">his second memoir,</a></span> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/phantom-twin/"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/phantom-twin/"><i>Twin</i></a> , the composer and pianist Allen Shawn writes about the trauma of losing his twin sister, Mary, to an institution when they were 8 years old. He describes her absence as “an unmourned death,” which closely matches my mother&#39;s experience; he writes, too, that when she was sent away, it felt to him like a form of punishment, “an expulsion, an exile,” which my mother has also recounted in melancholy detail.<br><br> But what most captured my attention was Shawn&#39;s analysis of how his sister affected his personality. “From an early age,” he writes, “I intuited that there were tensions surrounding Mary and instinctively took it upon myself to continue to be the easier child and avoid worrying my parents.”<br><br> That was my mother: the peerless good girl. High-achieving, rule-abiding, perfection-seeking. She skipped a grade. Until junior high, she chose practicing piano over playing with friends. In high school, she sang with the all-city chorus at Carnegie Hall.<br><br> Did she ever rebel? I asked her.<br><br> “Nah,” she said. “I was a goody-goody.”<br><br> To this day, my mother is the good girl. Buttoned-up, always reasonable, always in control. When hotter tempers flare around her, she defaults to a cool 66 degrees.<br><br> My mother was thrilled when her parents brought her newborn sister home. She remembers Adele scooching to different corners of her playpen to follow her as she ran in circles around it. She remembers sitting on the kitchen counter and watching my grandmother prepare bottles. She remembers my grandmother asking her to go on tiptoe into my grandparents&#39; room to see if Adele was asleep in her crib or still fussing. When my grandmother and grandfather began their frantic circuit of New York City&#39;s specialists, wondering what could be done to help Adele, my mother had no clue that anything was the matter. Why would she? She was 6 years old. She&#39;d always wanted a sibling and now she&#39;d been gifted one. Adele was marvelous. Adele was perfect. Adele was her sister.<br><br> When my grandparents left to take Adele to Willowbrook in March of 1953, they had no idea what to tell my mother, settling eventually on the story that they were taking her sister to “walking school.” My mom thought little of it. But for weeks, months, years, she kept expecting Adele to return. <i>When is she coming back?</i> she would regularly ask. <i>We don&#39;t know</i> , my grandparents would reply.<br><br> At 8, my mother one day had a sudden meltdown—became unstrung, hysterical—and demanded much more loudly to know when Adele would be returning, pointing out that it was taking her an awfully long time to learn how to walk. That was the first time she saw my grandmother cry.<br><br> <i>I don&#39;t know</i> , she still answered.<br><br> That same year, my great-grandmother, recently widowed, moved in with my grandparents. More specifically, she moved into my mother&#39;s room, into the twin bed that Adele was supposed to occupy. My mother was furious about having to move her things, furious that she was losing her privacy, furious that her grandmother was moving into Adele&#39;s bed. (Now she modified the question she regularly asked her parents: <i>Where will Adele sleep when she comes home?</i> And they would always reply: <i>We&#39;ll figure it out when the time comes.</i> ) Adele never did come home, and my grandparents would never try to have another child to fill that bed. My great-grandmother was there to stay.<br><br> My great-grandmother: Lord. She meant well, I suppose. But she had only a grade-school education and all the subtlety of a flyswatter. When my mother was 13, my great-grandmother told her that she had to be good enough for two children, smart enough for two children. “She kept emphasizing that my parents had lost a child,” my mother said. The pressure was awful.<br><br> By 13, of course, my mother had already figured out that something was different about her sister—and that Adele was never coming home. She&#39;d heard the neighborhood kids whisper. One cruelly declared she&#39;d heard Adele was in reform school. Consciously or unconsciously, my mother began handling the situation in her own way, volunteering in classrooms for kids with intellectual disabilities. Two liked her so much that she started tutoring them privately.<br><br> Yet throughout my mother&#39;s childhood, my grandparents never once invited her to come with them to visit Adele. At first she was told no children were allowed; by the time her parents did ask her to join them, my mother, at that point an adult with children of her own, said no. She felt too raw, too tender about it. She didn&#39;t want to unloose a current of ancient hurts. My grandparents never raised it again.<br><br> I asked if she ever sat around and just thought about Adele. “Oh, sure,” she told me. “I wonder what she would&#39;ve been like if she weren&#39;t disabled. I wonder what kind of relationship we would&#39;ve had. I wonder whether I would&#39;ve had nieces and nephews. Whether she would&#39;ve had a husband, whether she would&#39;ve had a good marriage, whether we would&#39;ve been close, whether we would&#39;ve lived near each other …”<br><br> And what ran through her mind, I asked, when she set eyes on Adele for the first time in 40 years, back in 1993? “I got deprived of having a real sibling,” she said.<br><br> For weeks afterward, I thought long and hard about this particular regret. Because my aunt <i>was</i> a real sibling. But no one of my mother&#39;s generation was told to think this way. The disabled were dramatically underestimated and therefore criminally undercultivated: hidden in institutions, treated interchangeably, decanted of all humanity—spectral figures at best, relegated to the margins of society and memory. Even their closest family members were trained to forget them. After my mother came home from that visit, she scribbled six pages of impressions titled “I Have a Sister.” As if she were finally allowing it to register. To acknowledge this clandestine part of herself.<br><br> It is painful, almost too painful, to think about how differently my mother might have felt—how different her life and my aunt&#39;s might have been—if they had been born today.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s June of 2022.</span> I&#39;ve just asked Adele how many pictures are sitting in front of me. My mother is skeptical. I ask again. “How many pictures? One …”<br><br> “One,” she repeats.<br><br> “Two …” I say.<br><br> “Two, three,” she finishes.<br><br> I look triumphantly at my mother.<br><br> My mother is now somewhere between skeptical and delighted. She tries herself. “How many fingers?” she asks, holding up her hand.<br><br> “Five.”<br><br> There are five.<br><br> “She understands,” I tell my mother.<br><br> “Well, either that or she memorized it.”<br><br> I show Adele two fingers and ask how many.<br><br> “Two.”<br><br> There&#39;s a reason my mother is surprised. When we visited Adele in 1998, she barely spoke at all, much less showed that she had a notional sense of quantity. (She will today show us that she can count to 12 before she starts skipping around.) She wasn&#39;t agitated back then when we saw her, not exactly. But she wasn&#39;t relaxed. A transfixing report about Adele, sent to my mother not that long ago, suggests that one of the reasons she may be more alert now—and possesses a larger vocabulary—is because she&#39;s on a better, less sedating regimen of medications.<br><br> But there&#39;s another reason, I think, for my mother&#39;s skepticism. Her whole life, she&#39;d been given to understand that Adele&#39;s condition was fixed—that her sister was consigned to a life without any deepening or growth. As she put it to me during that first car ride: “There would be no reason for her to get any more cognizant or any smarter.” That&#39;s how everyone thought about disability back in my mother&#39;s day. It&#39;s my own generation—and the ones following—that came to see the brain as a miracle of plasticity, teachable and retrainable right into old age.<br><br> Yet Adele exceeded the expectations of all the specialists who gave dire predictions to my grandparents. She did learn to talk. She did become toilet-trained. Not only can she walk, but she dances a mean salsa, which she shows us now—and where she gets her sense of rhythm, I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s great. (I personally dance like Elaine on <i>Seinfeld</i> .) Carmen and her husband, Juan, both from Puerto Rico, often play Latin music, and Adele jumps right in, with one hand on her belly and the other high and outward-facing, as if on the shoulder of an imaginary partner, all while shaking her hips and waggling her rear. Juan, whom she calls “Daddy,” often joins her.<br><br> Adele gently rests her head on my mother&#39;s shoulder and keeps it there. My mother, ordinarily a coil of discipline, looks so blissed out, so happy.<br><br> I ask Carmen (whom she calls “Mommy”) whether Adele knows any Spanish, given that she and Juan speak it around the house. She says yes.<br><br> “ <i>¡Mamá!</i> ” Carmen calls to Adele.<br><br> “What?”<br><br> “ <i>¿Tú quieres a papi?</i> ” Do you love Daddy?<br><br> “What?”<br><br> “ <i>¿Tú quieres mucho a papi?</i> ” Do you love Daddy a lot?<br><br> Adele nods emphatically.<br><br> “How much?” Carmen asks, switching to English. “How much you love Daddy? Let me see how much.”<br><br> “Four dollars.”<br><br> “Four dollars!” Carmen exclaims. “Oh my God.” Juan cracks up.<br><br> This kind of confusion is also typical of what we see in Adele throughout this, our second visit to the Ayala home. The report sent to my mother, which contains assessments of the institutions she&#39;s inhabited and the day programs she&#39;s attended throughout her life, continually notes that she has trouble grasping concepts—that she “can name various objects, but become[s] confused when long sentences are used.” It adds that she “often mumbles and is difficult to understand. If she does not understand what is being said to her, she simply says, &#39;Yeah.&#39; ”<br><br> And we do have a hard time understanding her, and she does say “Yeah” to a number of our basic questions about her day, which can make getting to know her frustrating. But not when she becomes animated about things she likes. Summer is approaching, for instance, which means Adele will shortly be going to camp. She adores camp. I ask what she does there. “A game! And color.” Coloring, she means.<br><br> Other things Adele loves: <i>Care Bears</i> , stuffed animals, blingy baseball hats, shopping at Walmart, wearing perfume, preparing Juan&#39;s nightclothes, tucking in her roommate each night.<br><br> Camp is the only time Carmen truly gets a break from caring for Adele and her two housemates—“I don&#39;t like to leave them with nobody,” she explains to me—and even when she does go out, she generally doesn&#39;t travel very far.<br><br> I stare at Carmen, now 80, and realize I already live in fear of the moment when she won&#39;t be able to look after my aunt anymore. She has pulmonary hypertension and requires oxygen every night, and sometimes during the day. Yet she still cares for her three charges, whose pictures populate her photo albums right alongside those of her biological kids and grandkids. (My favorite: Adele standing next to a life-size Angry Bird.) Every day, she helps bathe them; makes their beds; shops for them; manages their various doctor appointments; takes them on outings; and, with Juan, prepares their breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Five out of seven days, this means rising at 5 am In my aunt&#39;s specific case, it means doing her hair each morning just the way she likes, putting in her earrings, and pureeing her food—Adele refuses to wear her dentures.<br><br> “When I was raising my kids, you know—it&#39;s something that you miss,” Carmen explains.<br><br> Adele&#39;s transition to the Ayala home wasn&#39;t easy. Change is hard for her; she likes order. And when she arrived at Carmen&#39;s house 23 years ago, she had scabies, which—in addition to raising questions about how well cared for she&#39;d been in her previous home—meant that Carmen had to throw out everything she owned: her beloved stuffed animals, her clothes, her sheets. The adjustment became that much more traumatic; now my aunt truly had nothing. She threw tantrums. She once called Carmen “the B-word” (as Carmen puts it). Carmen phoned the home liaison. “And she says, &#39;Carmen, easy. She&#39;s a very good lady.&#39; ”<br><br> I ask how she earned my aunt&#39;s trust. “I used to sit down with her and, you know, I used to talk to her a lot,” she says. “Talking, talking, talking to her. I&#39;m telling her, &#39;Come here, help me with this&#39; or &#39;Help me with that.&#39; ”<br><br> Now, Carmen says, Adele can recite all of her grandchildren&#39;s names and knows them by sight. She demonstrates, asking Adele to name everyone in her son Edgar&#39;s family. “JJ, Lucas, Janet, Jessica …” Adele says. Neither of her housemates can do this. “It doesn&#39;t matter how long she hasn&#39;t seen them,” Evelyn, Carmen&#39;s daughter, later tells me. “She knows who they are. She has a memory that she&#39;ll meet somebody and she&#39;ll remember their name. That&#39;s her gift.”<br><br> Her gift? I am incredulous when I hear this. I keep thinking about what I&#39;ve been told my whole adult life: that Adele never even recognized her own mother, at least as far as my mom understood it. Was this some kind of misapprehension? Maybe Adele <i>had</i> known my grandmother? Or maybe she hadn&#39;t, but only because she&#39;d been so aggressively narcotized?<br><br> As Carmen is talking with us, Adele gently rests her head on my mother&#39;s shoulder and keeps it there. My mother, ordinarily a coil of discipline and control (always correct, always the good girl), looks so blissed out, so happy. When our visit is over, she tells me that this was her favorite part, Adele burrowing into her—and that she&#39;s already thinking about when she can next see her again.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">November 22, 1977:</span> <i>On medication due to head banging behaviors … She stares off into space, fixates on her hands, or hair and has the compulsion to smell people&#39;s hair</i> (Wassaic State School, Amenia, New York).<br><br> This is from the report sent to my mother, the one containing assessments of Adele from the different institutions she&#39;s lived in and day programs she&#39;s been a part of. I had a closer look at it maybe a week or two after our second visit.<br><br> February 11, 1986: <i>(Psychotropic) Meds originally prescribed for screaming, hitting others, hitting self, extreme irritability</i> (case-worker report from a day-treatment program, Ulster County, New York). It is noted that she is taking 150 milligrams daily of Mellaril, a first-generation antipsychotic.<br><br> October 1991: <i>Outbursts look like psychosis … yell[s] out statements such as “Adele. Stop that!” or … “Leave me alone!”</i> (summary of a report from a day program, Kingston, New York).<br><br> Late 2006: <i>Psychiatry providers now recognize that there is psychosis present and Zyprexa is effectively treating this</i> (summary of various evaluations).<br><br> The report is eight pages long. But you get the idea. The dear woman who nestled into my mother&#39;s shoulder, waved at us until our car pulled out of sight, and recently wandered into Carmen&#39;s room when she intuited that something was the matter (Carmen was unwell) also had an unremitting history, until not that long ago, of violent outbursts, self-harm, and psychosis.<br><br> Far be it from me to quarrel with those who evaluated her, including the esteemed men in white coats. But “psychosis” seemed, when I read this report, like an incomplete story, carrying with it the stench of laziness and <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest</i> reductivism— <i>This person is difficult; let&#39;s sedate her</i> .<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/autism-first-diagnosis-donald-triplett/674453/">John Donvan and Caren Zucker: What we learned from autism&#39;s first child</a><br><br> I could have been totally wrong. Based on this report, Adele certainly seemed, at times, to pose a danger to herself and others. But I found it curious that nowhere in this document did it say anything about a behavior that even my untrained eye detected immediately during our visits: My aunt does tons of harmless stimming, the repetitive motions frequently associated with autism. (She is especially fond of wiggling her fingers in front of her eyes.) In all the years of observational data about her—at least from what I saw here—there wasn&#39;t a word about this, or the word <i>autism</i> itself. And autistic individuals, when frustrated or confronted with change or responding to excessive stimuli, can sometimes behave aggressively—or in ways that could be misread as psychotic.<br><br> And so, for that matter, can traumatized people.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is December of 2022</span> . A visiting nurse, Emane, whom Adele calls Batman, is swabbing Adele&#39;s cheek. My aunt is being sweet and obedient; Emane, tender yet efficient. The sample will go to a lab in Marshfield, Wisconsin, that will sequence Adele&#39;s genes.<br><br> Wendy Chung, the Boston Children&#39;s Hospital geneticist with whom my mother and I are working, has warned us that there is only a one-in-three chance that Adele&#39;s genetic test will come back with a condition or syndrome that has an actual name. But Chung has told me, as have a number of other experts, that there&#39;s no other way to know for sure what Adele has. Dozens of things can cause microcephaly.<br><br> “But if you can find out exactly what she has,” Chung says, “then you can find a family—”<br><br> “—with a child who has it now,” I say.<br><br> Exactly, she says. And then I can compare how children with this syndrome fare today, versus how they fared in the 1950s.<br><br> My mother, Adele&#39;s medical proxy, had to sign the forms to do this genetic test. My aunt was incapable of giving her own consent. And it occurs to me, as I sit here watching her so docilely allow Emane to rake her cheek with a Q-tip, that Adele has never been able to give her consent for anything, good or bad, her whole life. Not for the medications she has taken, which may or may not have helped her; not for mammograms, which, given our family history, are indisputably a good idea. Not for any of the things that were done to her while she was institutionalized until the age of 28; not for a trip to the mall to get ice cream.<br><br> She cannot consent to this profile, I suddenly realize with some alarm.<br><br> I spend quite a few weeks fretting about this. Only after speaking with Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, a renowned bioethicist and disability scholar, do I understand exactly why this is so. The last thing I want to do is hurt Adele. So <i>not</i> writing about her would be consistent with this wish, in keeping with the benevolent spirit of the Hippocratic oath: I&#39;d be doing no harm. Whereas I am trying to do good, a much riskier proposition. “The problem with trying to do good,” she tells me, “is you don&#39;t know how it&#39;s going to come out.”<br><br> “I don&#39;t have a <i>legal</i> right to know anything about my relatives who were disappeared,” says Jennifer Natalya Fink, who faced a similar ethical predicament when she wrote <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/all-our-families-disability-lineage-and-the-future-of-kinship-jennifer-natalya-fink/9780807008133?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>All Our Families</i></a> . “But I have a <i>moral</i> right. And it&#39;s a moral wrong, what was done to them. For us not to keep perpetuating those wrongs, we have to integrate knowledge of our disabled forebears.”<br><br> There remains a school of thought that privileges the privacy of people with intellectual disabilities above all else, particularly when it comes to something as delicate as divulging their medical history. And this argument may be right. I don&#39;t know. But I ultimately decide, in the weeks after that swab, that integrating Adele means saying her name, and that understanding Adele—and her needs, and her potential, and whether she&#39;s been treated with the appropriate care and dignity her whole life—means knowing and naming whatever syndrome she has. To refrain from doing so would simply mean more erasure. Worse: It would imply that her condition is shameful, and there&#39;s been more than enough of that in my family.<br><br> To hell with shame.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">I don&#39;t know</span> why this is, but I keep coming back to my mother&#39;s deep desire for order. I had always assumed, I suppose, that it was a response to early trauma—a natural reaction to helplessly watching her sister get shipped away. But then I spent time with Adele and discovered that she shared the same trait, as if it were inscribed in the family genes.<br><br> I mention this one day to Evelyn, Carmen&#39;s daughter, on the phone. She mulls it over. “But maybe it comes from the same place in Adele,” she says. “She was taken from her mother. She&#39;s been controlled <i>her whole life</i> . You don&#39;t know what she&#39;s gone through, where she&#39;s been.”<br><br> I sit in chastened silence for several seconds. She is absolutely right. Of course it could come from the same place. Adele no doubt also experienced savage trauma in her life. It was just less legible, because she had no clear way to convey it. For all I know, my aunt is a <i>matryoshka</i> doll of buried pain.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In January of 1972,</span> Michael Wilkins met in a Staten Island diner with a young television journalist named Geraldo Rivera and discreetly handed him a key. It opened the doors to Building No. 6 at Willowbrook State School, from which Wilkins, a doctor, had recently been fired. He&#39;d been encouraging the parents of the children in that ward—and others, from the sound of it—to organize for better living conditions. The administration didn&#39;t like that very much.<br><br> In February of that year, Rivera&#39;s half-hour exposé, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abc7ny.com/willowbrook-geraldo-rivera-staten-island-bill-ritter/11575075/">Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace</a> ,” aired on WABC-TV. It was sickening. To this day, it remains one of the most powerful testaments to the horrors and moral degeneracy of institutionalization. You can easily find it on YouTube.<br><br> Rivera was by no means the first to visit Willowbrook. Robert F. Kennedy had toured the place in 1965 and called it “a snake pit.” But because Rivera suddenly had access to one of the ghastliest dorms on campus, he and his camera crew could storm the premises unannounced. What he found—and what his viewers saw—was the kind of suffering one associates with early-Renaissance depictions of hell. The room was dark and bare. The children were naked, wailing, and rocking on the floor. Some were caked in their own feces. “How can I tell you about the way it smelled?” Rivera asked. “It smelled of filth, it smelled of disease, and it smelled of death.” He went on to interview Wilkins, who made it clear that Willowbrook wasn&#39;t a “school” at all. “Their life is just hours and hours of endless nothing to do,” he said of the patients, adding that 100 percent of them contracted hepatitis within the first six months of moving in.<br><br> Actually, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leahrosenbaum/2020/06/12/willowbrook-scandal-hepatitis-experiments-hideous-truths-of-testing-vaccines-on-humans/?sh=23070f41279c">doctors were deliberately giving some of those children hepatitis</a> . Even into the 1970s, the intellectually disabled were the subjects of government-funded medical experiments.<br><br> “Trauma is severe,” Wilkins told Rivera, “because these patients are left together on a ward—70 retarded people, basically unattended, fighting for a small scrap of paper on the floor to play with, fighting for the attention of the attendants.”<br><br> “Can the children be trained?” Rivera asked at one point.<br><br> “Yes,” the doctor said. “Every child can be trained. There&#39;s no effort. We don&#39;t know what these kids are capable of doing.”<br><br> This was where my aunt spent the formative period of her youth, from the time she was a toddler until she was 12 or 13 years old. Though she left eight years before Rivera and his crew arrived, it&#39;s hard to imagine that the conditions were any better in her day. As Kim E. Nielsen writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/a-disability-history-of-the-united-states-kim-e-nielsen/9780807022047?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>A Disability History of the United States</i></a> , World War II was devastating for these institutions, which were hardly exemplary to begin with. The young men who worked there were shipped off to war, and most of the other employees found better-paying jobs and superior conditions in defense plants. These state facilities remained dreadfully poor-paying and understaffed from then on, their budgets forever in governors&#39; crosshairs.<br><br> “It was horrible,” Diana McCourt told me. She placed her daughter, Nina, born with severe autism, in Willowbrook in 1971. “She always smelled of urine. Everything smelled of urine. It&#39;s like it was in the bricks and mortar.”<br><br> Diana and her husband, Malachy McCourt—the memoirist, actor, radio host, and famous New York pub owner—soon became outspoken activists and got involved in a class-action lawsuit against the institution. “I can&#39;t quite tell you how much they didn&#39;t want us to witness what was going on inside,” Malachy told me. When children were presented to their parents, they were taken to the entranceway of their dorm after being hastily dressed by attendants. “The clothes were never her clothes,” Diana said. “She was wearing whatever they could find in the pile.”<br><br> But most chilling of all was an offhand comment Diana made about the reports she received about her daughter. They were vague, she said, or demonstrably untrue, or maddeningly pedestrian—that she&#39;d just gone to see the dentist, for instance. “The dentist,” Diana said, “was notorious for pulling people&#39;s teeth.”<br><br> Wait, I said. Repeat that?<br><br> “Instead of dental care, they pulled the teeth out.”<br><br> Is <i>that</i> how my aunt lost her teeth?<br><br> Rivera noted in his special that the wards contained no toothbrushes that he could see.<br><br> I&#39;d like to think that Adele&#39;s life improved when she went to Wassaic State School in 1964. But New York produced, at that moment in time, nothing but hellholes. (Rivera also visited Letchworth Village in his documentary, an institution so awful that the McCourts steered clear of it, opting for Willowbrook instead.) Wassaic, too, had a reputation for being grim. At least one note from the report sent to my mother indicated that my aunt was very keen on leaving it. The date was January 18, 1980. Adele was by then 28 years old and had enough of a vocabulary to get her point across. “Clothes and suitcase?” she asked one of the clinicians.<br><br> Even when my aunt finally transferred to residential care, living in private homes and attending local programs in upstate New York, her treatment, until the &#39;90s, seemed less than ideal. In March of 1980, my aunt attended a day facility in an old factory that still had very loud electric and pneumatic machines, and the result was disastrous—“agitated, violent outbursts.” She was frequently taken to the “Quiet Room,” quilted with actual padded walls, where the staff would physically restrain her. This practice, the report notes, is no longer used in New York.<br><br> It took seven years and nine months before her team realized that the industrial cacophony was causing a good deal of the problem.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is mid-December 2022.</span> Adele&#39;s genetic test has come back.<br><br> Her disorder does indeed have a name. Remarkably, it would not have had a name if we&#39;d tested her just four years ago. But in 2020, a group of 50-plus researchers announced their discovery of Coffin-Siris syndrome 12, the “12” signifying a rare subtype within an already rare disorder. At the time they made this discovery, they could identify just 12 people in the world whose intellectual disability was caused by a mutation in this particular gene. Since then, says Scott Barish, the lead author of the paper announcing the finding, the number has climbed to somewhere between 30 and 50. So now, with my aunt, it&#39;s that number plus one.<br><br> I immediately join a Facebook group for people with Coffin-Siris syndrome. I find only a few parents with children who have the same subtype as Adele. One couple lives in Moscow; another, Italy. But as soon as I post something about my aunt, there&#39;s a flurry of replies from mothers and fathers of kids across the Coffin-Siris spectrum, most of them focused on the same thing: Adele&#39;s age. Seventy-one! How thrilling that someone with Coffin-Siris syndrome could live that long! They want to know all about her, and what kind of health she is in. (Robust, I reply.)<br><br> Because Coffin-Siris syndrome, first described in 1970, can be caused by mutations in any one of a variety of genes, its manifestations vary. As a rule, though, the disorder involves some level of intellectual disability and developmental delays. Many people with Coffin-Siris syndrome also have “coarse facial features,” a phrase I&#39;ve come to absolutely loathe; trouble with different organ systems; and underdeveloped pinkie fingers or toes (which is how, before genetic testing came along, a specialist might suspect a patient had it). Some, though by no means all, have microcephaly.<br><br> As far as I know, my aunt&#39;s fingers and toes are all fully developed—Coffin-Siris syndrome 12 doesn&#39;t seem to affect pinkies as much—and she doesn&#39;t appear to have any organ trouble. She does, however, have microcephaly, as did four of the 12 subjects in<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(20)30400-6">the breakthrough paper about her specific subtype</a> . But what really stood out to me in that study—and I mean really shone in a hue all its own—was this: Five of the dozen subjects displayed autistic traits.<br><br> In fact, the sparse literature on this subject suggests that a substantial portion of people with Coffin-Siris syndrome, no matter what genetic variant they&#39;ve got, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.802583/full">have a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder as well</a> .<br><br> Which is what I&#39;ve suspected my aunt has had all along.<br><br> Knowing what I now do, I&#39;m that much keener to find a family with a child who has Coffin-Siris syndrome 12 that would be willing to welcome me into their home. I call Barish, the lead author of the breakthrough paper, who heroically refers me to two. But one suddenly becomes shy and the other lives in Ireland. I start making my way through the other 50 co–first authors, co–corresponding authors, and just plain co-authors listed in the study. For a long while, I get nothing—turns out I&#39;m talking to lab people, mostly—though I learn a lot about protein complexes and gene expression.<br><br> Then I reach Isabelle Thiffault, a molecular geneticist at Children&#39;s Mercy Kansas City. By some extraordinary fluke, she has, in her database, <i>four</i> children with my aunt&#39;s subtype. Two have microcephaly. One of those two is a 7-year-old girl named Emma, who lives in the Kansas City area.<br><br> I call her mom, Grace Feist. Would she mind if I paid a visit? She would not.<br><br> Grace and her husband, Jerry, took Emma in at seven months old and adopted her at a year and a half, knowing she had significant intellectual and developmental delays. They were prepared. They had fallen in love.<br><br> They also had ample state resources at their disposal, heavily subsidized or even free. More still: They had a rich universe of support groups to draw from, a sophisticated public school in their backyard, and the benefit of a culture that&#39;s come a long way toward appreciating neurodiversity.<br><br> They were able to actively choose Emma. Whereas my grandparents—pressured by doctors, stamped by stigma, broken by exhaustion and confusion and pain—felt like they had no choice but to give their daughter away.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">“So this is</span> the best thing, because it will keep your hair nice and neat, and it doesn&#39;t have any tingles.”<br><br> Tingles? I ask. It&#39;s late February of 2023. We&#39;re sitting in Emma&#39;s bedroom in Lee&#39;s Summit, Missouri, and she&#39;s waving a new silk pillowcase at me.<br><br> “They&#39;re like big stuff in your hair.” She gestures at her thick brown ponytail.<br><br> Tingles … oh, tangles!<br><br> She nods. “Guess what? Tangles will get in your hair. If Mommy&#39;s brushing, I will be so mad.”<br><br> A few feet from her is a mounted poster that says <span class="smallcaps">For like Ever</span> . As in: <i>We&#39;ve embraced this little girl for life—for, like, ever.</i> Grace got it at TJ Maxx shortly after Emma&#39;s adoption became official.<br><br> Every time I hear Emma speak, I find it hard to believe that she and my aunt have a mutation in the same gene. She chatters merrily in full sentences, talks about her friends, and can express how she feels, often in ways that are surprising or quite poignant.<br><br> “Emma, are you the same as other kids or different?” Grace asks when we pick her up at school the next day.<br><br> “Different.”<br><br> “Why?” she asks.<br><br> “Because I&#39;m the only one doing coloring. Not the other kids.”<br><br> “Do you like being different?” I ask her.<br><br> “No.”<br><br> “Why?” I ask.<br><br> “Because I want to be like other people.”<br><br> But what I&#39;m stuck on is all the ways that Emma <i>started out</i> like my aunt. When Grace and Jerry (a very involved father, just shy around reporters) first took her in at seven months to foster her, “she just lay there like a two-month-old baby,” Grace says. “We thought she was blind.” She didn&#39;t make eye contact; she couldn&#39;t roll. But in Bismarck, North Dakota, where Grace and Jerry were living at the time, Emma was entitled to all kinds of state-funded early intervention, as she is in Missouri. By nine months old, she was sitting unsupported, thanks to hours spent in a special tube swing to help her develop her core muscles.<br><br> Emma wasn&#39;t as late to walk as Adele, but she didn&#39;t take her first wobbly step until 16 months, and because it was 2016, rather than the early 1950s, physical therapists again intervened, having her toddle on uneven surfaces—pillows, cushions—to bolster muscle tone. She developed a smoother gait at about 2, but it took a couple more years for her to have the balance and coordination to walk normally, or to climb the stairs without help.<br><br> And speech! A huge surprise. Emma may be a bubbly ingenue, telling me all about indoor recess and her BFFs at school, but that&#39;s hardly how she started. When she was 4 years old, she had only 100 words in her vocabulary, and that&#39;s a generous estimate. “The way it was described was: She&#39;s not deaf, but it&#39;s almost the speech of someone who can&#39;t hear,” Grace says. But Emma was working with state-funded speech therapists at the time, and they determined that she had auditory-processing disorder. When she got to her public school in Lee&#39;s Summit—which gives extra speech and occupational therapy to those who need it, plus additional reading and math instruction—her vocabulary started to grow, slowly at first, and then in a rush. “I don&#39;t know what it was,” Grace says.<br><br> Well. I have some idea. It was having a supportive school. It was having several hours a week of occupational, physical, and speech therapy from the time Emma was an infant. And it was Grace herself.<br><br> If you&#39;re going to have an intellectual disability, who you really want as your mother is Grace Feist. Thirty-three, forever in flip-flops, and brimming with opinions—she has the concentrated energy of a honeybee—Grace has gone to exceptional lengths to tend to Emma&#39;s education and psychological well-being. She&#39;s decorated the basement playroom in pastels and muted colors. (“With visual-processing disorder, which Emma has, it&#39;s not as overwhelming,” Grace explains.) Once a week, she takes Emma to vision therapy; she picks Emma up at school early every day to focus even more on her reading and math at home, without distraction. Grace is the queen of resourcefulness when it comes to all things pedagogical.<br><br> “I had a developmental pediatrician tell me: &#39;There is no rock you haven&#39;t looked under. This is what you have, and that&#39;s okay,&#39; ” she says. “And he came from the best of intentions. But let me tell you, there were, like, 50 rocks I hadn&#39;t looked under.”<br><br> As Grace and Emma give me a tour of Emma&#39;s in-home classroom, all I can think is, <i>My God, the effort</i> . It contains a bucket of at least 80 fidget toys, many of them simple household items repurposed for anxious hands (silicone sink scrubbers, sewing bobbins). Emma sits on a purple wobble disk—it looks like a whoopee cushion the size of a satellite dish—to continue developing her core muscles. The walls are lined with giant flash cards from Secret Stories, a phonics-based reading program that makes intuitive sense and seems kind of <i>fun</i> , which is a good thing, because almost nothing demoralizes Emma more than trying to read. She can barely do it, though she&#39;s trying.<br><br> “How does reading feel?” Grace asks.<br><br> “Mad,” Emma says. She&#39;s wearing a resplendent lavender shirt with daisies on it. “Because if Mommy say, &#39;Read this now,&#39; I would be super grumpy. Because they have hard words.” She&#39;s pointing to a rudimentary book she&#39;s been struggling with. “But some people say, &#39;This is easy!&#39; ”<br><br> “How does that make you feel?” Grace asks.<br><br> “Mad. Sad.”<br><br> We move on to look at the shelves on the wall. They&#39;re stocked with tactile learning tools: numbers made of sandpaper. Montessori cubes showing multiples of 10. Wax Wikki Stix to make letter shapes.<br><br> “If you change the approach to everything being multisensory—you see it, you hear it, you taste it, you touch it, you smell it—then you learn it,” Grace says. “Because you&#39;re using all these neural pathways for the same information. Then everyone can learn.”<br><br> Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t be surprised by Grace&#39;s tenacity. She was raised in Florida, near Orlando, and had her first daughter, Chloe, at 16. She joined the Navy as a reservist in 2010 and worked for a time as a military police officer; then she worked security in an oil field in North Dakota, where she made great money and got to see the northern lights, as long as she was willing to put up with temperatures 20 degrees below zero. She met Jerry, then an information technologist, on the website Plenty of Fish. Today, he&#39;s a professional YouTuber, with an inspirational-Christian channel that has 2.6 million subscribers. On December 28, 2016, they adopted Emma. In 2018, Grace gave birth to another daughter, Anna.<br><br> “Having Anna was the best thing for Emma,” Grace says, “because it really taught her how to play—with other kids, even with toys. That mimicking, that seeing what to do. Because when you would buy Emma toys, she would just line them up.”<br><br> Grace and Jerry have made enormous sacrifices on Emma&#39;s behalf. The whole family has. They don&#39;t travel, because Emma needs structure and control. They seldom go to restaurants, but when they do, they bring along her purple noise-canceling headphones—shooting earmuffs, purchased at Walmart—in case the sound overwhelms her; she needs to leave the restaurant several times a meal in any event, just to ground herself. “That&#39;s how we live our life,” Grace says.<br><br> Their life used to be even more difficult. When she was younger, Emma, like my aunt, was inclined toward self-harm. When I first mention to Grace that Adele has no teeth—and that I fear they were removed at Willowbrook or Wassaic—Grace cuts me off: “Because she would bite herself until she bled?”<br><br> Sweet Jesus. I hadn&#39;t even thought of that.<br><br> “Because Emma did,” Grace says. “I have pictures of it.”<br><br> She doesn&#39;t show me those pictures. But she does show me a picture of 4-year-old Emma with a giant green-and-purple Frankenstein bruise bulging from her forehead. “She&#39;d hit herself in the face,” Grace says. “She would bang her head on the floor, like, hard.”<br><br> And why does she think Emma did that? “She&#39;s trapped in this mind where she knows what she wants, she knows what she needs, but <i>you</i> don&#39;t know, and she doesn&#39;t know how to tell you,” Grace says. “Is she aggressive?是的。 I would be pissed too.”<br><br> I haven&#39;t noticed any aggression in Emma—just a lot of sass, a gal who wants to show off her dance moves and introduce me to her stuffies. But again, this may be in part due to early-childhood interventions: Armies of occupational and speech therapists taught her how to be gentle, demonstrating how to talk kindly to dolls, and they encouraged Grace to teach Emma sign language, which she did, so that Emma could better express her wishes. As Emma got older, Grace read tons of books about emotional self-regulation, teaching her daughter to externalize her frustration. “We&#39;d be in the middle of Walmart and she&#39;d be stomping her feet,” Grace says. “But you know what? She wasn&#39;t punching herself in the head.”<br><br> Today, Emma is flourishing. She may not yet know her phone number or address. She may not be able to tell you the names of the months or all the days of the week. But she&#39;s making great strides, especially now that she&#39;s learning at home. When I left her house in late February, she could count to 12; four months later, she was adding and subtracting. “Emma is going to thrive in her life,” Grace says. “Is she going to work at McDonald&#39;s? Maybe. Is she gonna bag groceries? Maybe. But she&#39;s gonna be okay.” Grace&#39;s goal, she says, is to make sure that Emma&#39;s mental health always comes first. “I have never met anyone more resilient or determined,” she adds.<br><br> As I prepare to leave, Grace gives me two gifts she&#39;s purchased for my aunt. They&#39;re things Emma likes: a lavender-scented unicorn Warmie (a stuffed animal you can safely heat in the microwave) and Pinch Me therapy dough that smells like oranges. “Anything scented is always really calming for Emma,” she explains.<br><br> Then Emma hands me a picture she&#39;s drawn of me and Adele. Grace asks if she remembers why she drew it. “Yeah!” Emma says. “Because she has a hard time going to school.”<br><br> “Like you,” Grace says. Then: “You know what her aunt has?”<br><br> I assume she is going to say something about Coffin-Siris syndrome 12, but in a way that&#39;s comprehensible to a child who has it too. But that isn&#39;t where Grace is headed. “She has a woman who loves her and takes care of her because her mommy wasn&#39;t able to. Just like you. Did you know that?”<br><br> Emma shakes her head.<br><br> I thank Grace and Emma for the gifts and head out to my rental car. I last maybe 30 seconds before losing it.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Is it a fair</span> or genuine comparison, lining up my aunt and Emma side by side? Using Emma&#39;s life story thus far as some kind of counterfactual history? To ask <i>What if?</i><br><br> Yes and no, obviously.<br><br> There&#39;s variability in all genetic disorders, including Coffin-Siris syndrome, even among those with mutations in the same gene. The original paper looking at my aunt&#39;s specific subtype found that four out of the 12 individuals had microcephaly, for example, but one had macrocephaly; go figure. My aunt and Emma, though they both have subtype 12, clearly have different manifestations of it, a phenomenon one can observe just from looking at them: Emma is big for her age while my aunt is tiny; my aunt&#39;s microcephaly is unignorable, because her sutures—the flexible material between a baby&#39;s skull bones—closed prematurely, while Emma&#39;s didn&#39;t, making her microcephaly harder to detect. Her doctor says it may be easier to see as she gets older, though.<br><br> “If your aunt had had the treatments available today, I suspect her life would be very different,” says Bonnie Sullivan, the clinical geneticist at Children&#39;s Mercy Kansas City who treats Emma. We&#39;re speaking just days after I return home. She has looked at both Adele&#39;s and Emma&#39;s specific gene mutations. “She may not have been as high-functioning as Emma, but she could have maximized her potential, and her quality of life would&#39;ve been a lot better.”<br><br> It seems impossible to quarrel with this assessment. The literature on disability is bursting with stories—heartening or depressing, depending on your point of view—about the advances made by people with intellectual disabilities once they were liberated from the medieval torments of their institutions. Studies as far back as the 1960s showed that children with Down syndrome begin to speak earlier and have higher IQs if they&#39;re kept in home settings rather than institutional ones. Judith Scott, warehoused with Down syndrome in 1950 at the age of 7, famously became an artist once her twin sister established herself as her legal guardian 35 years later; her handsome fiber-art sculptures are now part of the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Centre Pompidou.<br><br> If my aunt could expand her vocabulary simply by going off a useless antipsychotic, imagine what else she might have been capable of over the course of her life, if only she&#39;d been given a hundredth of a chance.<br><br> But perhaps the best-known example of what happens to underloved, understimulated children are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/can-an-unloved-child-learn-to-love/612253/">the orphans from Nicolae Ceauşescu&#39;s Romania</a> , where “child gulags” warehoused some 170,000 kids in appalling conditions. These children became tragic, unwilling conscripts in an inadvertent mass experiment in institutional neglect. When, 11 years after Ceauşescu&#39;s execution, American researchers finally began to study 136 of them, putting half in foster settings and monitoring their development, the findings were bleak. Only 18 percent of those still in orphanages <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4098033/">showed secure attachments by age 3 and a half</a> , versus almost 50 percent of those who&#39;d been transferred to family settings. By the time the kids still in orphanages had reached 16, more than 60 percent suffered from a psychiatric condition.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/can-an-unloved-child-learn-to-love/612253/">From the July/August 2020 issue: 30 years ago, Romania deprived thousands of babies of human contact</a><br><br> Which brings me back to my aunt&#39;s repeated diagnoses, over the years, of psychosis. Maybe the condition was inevitable; maybe my aunt would have been psychotic no matter what kind of life she&#39;d led. But when I watched those gruesome spools of footage from Willowbrook, all I could think was: <i>Who wouldn&#39;t be driven mad by such a place?</i> After she left Willowbrook, Adele would abruptly shout “Stop hurting me!” for no apparent reason. Her care team assumed she was having hallucinations, a plausible postulate. But isn&#39;t it equally plausible to theorize that she was reliving some unspeakable abuse from her past? Or, as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-life-worth-living-disability-pain-and-morality-joel-michael-reynolds/9781517907785?affiliate_id=atl-347">Georgetown philosopher and disability-studies professor Joel Michael Reynolds</a> puts it (speaking my thoughts aloud): “Why isn&#39;t that a completely reasonable response to PTSD?”<br><br> I&#39;ll never know how Adele&#39;s life could have turned out if she&#39;d been born in 2015, as Emma was. All I have is a plague of questions.<br><br> What if a task force of occupational, speech, and physical therapists had shown up at my grandparents&#39; home each week, teaching Adele to walk, talk, and gently play with dolls?<br><br> What if she had spent her formative years not rotting in her own diapers or staring at the walls, but engaging in organized play, attending school, and basking in the company of adults who loved her?<br><br> What if she&#39;d had caretakers who inhaled book after book about emotional self-regulation and encouraged her to stomp her feet in department stores, rather than hit herself in the head?<br><br> And what if— <i>what if</i> —Adele had had a sister to play with?<br><br> It&#39;s possible that all the interventions in the world would have done nothing, or next to it. Sullivan says she&#39;s seen families recruit every imaginable expert and pour their energies into every conceivable intervention, yet with depressingly little to show for it. “There are some individuals with such severe manifestations of certain disorders that aggressive interventions don&#39;t seem to change the outcome very much,” she says. “And it kills me. I truly grieve that result. Because the parents are trying everything.”<br><br> Similarly, there are children who wind up in residential care in spite of their parents&#39; best and most valiant efforts, because their risk of self-harm or of harming others remains too great. Parents are not, nor should they be expected to be, saints.<br><br> But my mind keeps looping back to that eight-page report my mother was sent about Adele&#39;s history. The notes from Willowbrook, what few there are, tell a story all their own.<br><br> March 19, 1953: <i>21-month-old girl, quite small for her age … able to sit without support, to imitate movements, and is reported to be able to say “mama.”</i> Adele&#39;s IQ is measured at 52.<br><br> February 1, 1960: <i>Microcephalic child of 8 ½ years with limited speech and partial echolalia. She is disoriented, and her acquaintance with simple objects in her surroundings is rather poor even for her overall mental level … Rate of development has markedly slowed down since the last evaluation 7 years ago.</i> <i>The consequent drop in IQ is considerable.</i> This time it is measured at 27.<br><br> In her seven years of staring at those walls and rocking naked on the floor and never once, I assume, being shown a particle of love apart from those brief visits from my grandparents, Adele&#39;s IQ dropped by almost half, startling even those who evaluated her. And yes, maybe this was destined to happen; maybe her smaller brain had less noticeable consequences in a toddler than in an 8-year-old.<br><br> But if my aunt could expand her vocabulary simply by going off a useless antipsychotic and onto Zyprexa—in middle age!—imagine what else she might have been capable of over the course of her life, if only she&#39;d been given a half, a quarter, a hundredth of a chance.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s A sunny day</span> in May of this year. I&#39;m working on the back deck, nearing the end of writing this story. My cellphone rings. It&#39;s Evelyn, Carmen&#39;s daughter. She apologizes for calling me on a Sunday, but something serious has happened. Adele has collapsed; she&#39;s in the hospital; it&#39;s looking bad. Can I please locate my mom?<br><br> I leave messages everywhere and call Adele&#39;s nurse, Emane, who I&#39;ve been told is in the hospital with her. Emane is upset. No one will tell her anything. She&#39;s been banished to the waiting room. They really need my mother, my aunt&#39;s medical proxy.<br><br> A few minutes later, my mother phones them. A few minutes after that, my father conveys the news to me: Adele has died.<br><br> A heart attack, apparently. Just after breakfast.<br><br> I call Evelyn. She is crying. I stammer my way through this conversation, also crying, but mainly because we barely got to know my aunt, because this was supposed to be the beginning of something and not the end, because I know the grief I feel in no way matches Evelyn&#39;s or Carmen&#39;s or Juan&#39;s. I am fluttering with an awkward mixture of shame, regret, sadness. “She was loved,” Evelyn keeps saying, over and over.<br><br> I know, I say. I just wish more by us.<br><br> “You came at exactly the right time,” Evelyn assures me. “I truly believe that.”<br><br> I hang up. God, they&#39;re so gracious, this family. “We don&#39;t judge,” Evelyn told us the first time we went up to see Adele at the Ayalas&#39;. She meant it.<br><br> I phone my mother. She has lurched into administrative mode, planning the funeral. This is peak Mom, organizing things, surmounting the tough stuff by finding footholds in the small details. I wait a bit and call Carmen, though with some trepidation. My mother says she was unhelmed—bawling—when they first spoke. Carmen, calmer but still sobbing throughout our talk, tells me it&#39;s true. “I broke down. I didn&#39;t expect it to happen like that.”<br><br> We bury Adele three days later. It&#39;s a gorgeous afternoon, perfect really, but the incongruities and dissonances of the hour are hard to ignore. Here we are, having a Jewish funeral for a woman who was never exposed to the Jewish tradition her whole life, while those whose lives have been most brutally upended—those who have spent the past 24 years loving and caring for Adele—are Catholics. My aunt will be buried next to her mother, forever reunited, while the woman whom she called “Mommy”—who just four nights ago rubbed Vicks VapoRub on her back and brought her tea because she had a cough—will go back to a house with an empty twin bed.<br><br> I&#39;d like to think that in the afterlife, my grandmother&#39;s heart will mend. That she will never again be told to send Adele away, that God will say to her: <i>It&#39;s okay, she&#39;s lovely as she is; she&#39;s my child too.</i><br><br> Problem is, I&#39;m not much of a believer. I wish I was.<br><br> But the rabbi, Lisa Rubin, is brilliant, making something seamless out of the chaotic threads of my aunt&#39;s life and the untidy grief of this motley group, managing to acknowledge the trauma of my mother, the trauma of my aunt, and the trauma of my grandparents, showing them the compassion they deserved their whole lives but probably never got and certainly never gave to themselves. And she honors the Ayala family in the most beautiful way, invoking the Jewish legend of the <i>Lamed Vavniks</i> , or 36 individuals in every generation who are the most righteous of all humanity. “They&#39;re often called the hidden saints among us,” she says. “The people who do God&#39;s work faithfully and humbly and whose virtue keeps the world spinning. They pour compassion and love on those around them with no desire for recognition.” To my family, she says, Carmen, Juan, and Evelyn are the <i>Lamed Vavniks</i> —“the hidden saints of Adele&#39;s life.”<br><br> The Ayalas are all discreetly weeping. Carmen will later tell me: <i>I will miss Adele so much</i> .<br><br> My mother is invited to speak next. Evelyn will speak after her, then one of Adele&#39;s housemates, then Adele&#39;s psychologist, then her case manager—it&#39;s wonderful that they&#39;ve turned up.<br><br> But my mother … I&#39;m not quite prepared. She starts with a version of something I&#39;ve heard before—that losing Adele was a trauma that took decades to heal. But then she elaborates in a way she hasn&#39;t even in our most intimate discussions: The three times she saw Adele back in the &#39;90s, she still felt disconnected from her. Adele&#39;s previous caretakers had left my mom and my grandmother (and in one case, my mom and me) all alone with my aunt in their living room; they hadn&#39;t said a thing about who Adele was or what her place was in their home. That changed, my mother says, when she saw Adele at the Ayalas&#39;, discovering the charming, idiosyncratic character of her baby sister—and how very much she was loved, how she fit into a family.<br><br> “Those visits changed everything for me,” she says. “I opened my heart to Adele after shutting her out for nearly 70 years, and I found myself loving her again the same way I did as a 6-year-old child.” I hear a catch in her voice. She pauses, then regains her composure. “Now,” she continues, “I&#39;ve lost Adele for the second time. And it hurts in a way I never expected. But I would not trade those visits for anything, because my life is so much richer. Adele has taught me to love in a whole new way.”<br><br> She finishes. And then, without warning, she rushes into the arms of my dad and starts crying in deep, seismic sobs. “I lost all those years,” she says into his shirt. I can barely make it out.<br><br> I&#39;ve never seen her sense of control desert her in this way.<br><br> My mind wanders back to the last time I saw Adele. It was December, when Emane swabbed her cheek. I was alone then, just me and my recording device; my mother was in Florida. Carmen reminded Adele that I was her niece, her sister&#39;s daughter. “Do you remember Rona?”她问。 “Yeah,” Adele said, but it wasn&#39;t a convincing “yeah”—more like one of the blank ones she uttered when she didn&#39;t understand.<br><br> We collected Adele&#39;s DNA, and then I stuck around, curious to see how my aunt passed her afternoons and evenings. Spending that brief stretch with her meant experiencing time in a sensual way, almost, just feeling the thickness of the hours as they passed. We sat for a while together in the kitchen. Then we went upstairs to her bedroom, a warm, delightful space, her dresser tumbling with stuffed animals and her bed popping with a pink Disney-princess blanket. Adele carefully selected her outfit for the next day, matching every item of clothing, down to her socks.<br><br> There are many different shades of periwinkle blue. I had no idea.<br><br> Then she undressed, put on a plush lavender bathrobe, and headed into the shower to slowly bathe herself and wash her hair. Carmen supervised, but left her alone. After she&#39;d dried herself off, Adele headed back into her room, closed all of the blinds (“for night”), and settled into her rocking chair. She spent the next half an hour, at least, just rocking. She often wiggled her fingers in front of her eyes. Occasionally she broke into a smile or chanted the same words to herself (“paint, pepper”) or gave a little laugh. She seemed content.<br><br> But in the shower—and I&#39;ll never forget this, not for as long as my battered memory is intact—she babbled much more coherently. “Sister. Rona. Janet. Mirna. Rrrrrrrona”—she rolled the <i>R</i> —“A doll. A teddy bear.”<br><br> I&#39;ve listened to that wisp of audio dozens of times, just to make sure I didn&#39;t wish those words into existence.<br><br> <i>Sister. Rona.</i> She was already committing my mother&#39;s name to memory, and to her own family tree, along with Carmen&#39;s daughter and daughter-in-law, Mirna and Janet. Her ability to sweep in such things was, as Evelyn said, her gift. And now, we in our family will finally be committing her name to ours, which for so long—so pointlessly long—had a phantom bough.<br><br> Adele Halperin. Daughter, sister, aunt.

The question that keeps me up at night now—with increasing urgency as 2024 approaches—is whether we have done enough to rebuild our defenses or whether our democracy is still highly vulnerable to attack and subversion.<br><br> There&#39;s reason for concern: the influence of dark money and corporate power, right-wing propaganda and misinformation, malign foreign interference in our elections, and the vociferous backlash against social progress. The “vast right-wing conspiracy” has been of compelling interest to me for many years. But I&#39;ve long thought something important was missing from our national conversation about threats to our democracy. Now recent findings from a perhaps unexpected source—America&#39;s top doctor—offer a new perspective on our problems and valuable insights into how we can begin healing our ailing nation.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/01/loneliness-solitude-pandemic-habit/672631/">Arthur C. Brooks: How we learned to be lonely</a><br><br> In May, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy published an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">advisory</a> , warning that a growing “epidemic of loneliness and isolation” threatens Americans&#39; personal health and also the health of our democracy. Murthy reported that, even before COVID, about half of all American adults were experiencing substantial levels of loneliness. Over the past two decades, Americans have spent significantly more time alone, engaging less with family, friends, and people outside the home. By 2018, just 16 percent of Americans said they felt very attached to their local community.<br><br> An “epidemic of loneliness” may sound abstract at a time when our democracy faces concrete and imminent threats, but the surgeon general&#39;s report helps explain how we became so vulnerable. In the past, surgeons general have at crucial moments sounded the alarm about major crises and drawn our attention to underappreciated threats, including <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2020-cessation-sgr-full-report.pdf">smoking</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/sci_data/misc/type_txt/sgrpt.asp">HIV/AIDS</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/pdf/calltoaction.pdf">obesity</a> . This is one of those moments.<br><br> The rate of young adults who report suffering from loneliness went up every single year from 1976 to 2019. From 2003 to 2020, the average time that young people spent in person with friends declined by nearly 70 percent. Then the pandemic turbocharged our isolation.<br><br> According to the surgeon general, when people are disconnected from friends, family, and communities, their lifetime risk of heart disease, dementia, depression, and stroke skyrockets. Shockingly, prolonged loneliness is as bad, or worse, for our health as being obese or smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/14/opinion/treating-loneliness.html?referringSource=articleShare">Researchers</a> also say that loneliness can generate anger, resentment, and even paranoia. It diminishes civic engagement and social cohesion, and increases political polarization and animosity. Unless we address this crisis, Murthy warned, “we will continue to splinter and divide until we can no longer stand as a community or a country.”<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n 1996,</span> I published <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/it-takes-a-village-hillary-rodham-clinton/9781416540649?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>It Takes a Village</em></a> . As first lady, I was worried that American life had become frantic and fragmented for many people, especially stressed-out parents. Social, economic, and technological trends seemed to be pulling us apart rather than lifting us up. We were spending more time in our cars and in front of the television and less time engaging in our communities. Even back then, before smartphones and social media, it was evident that Americans were becoming more isolated, lonely, and unmoored from traditional sources of meaning and support—and that our kids were suffering because of this. I also was concerned about the rise of right-wing politicians like Newt Gingrich and media personalities like Rush Limbaugh who were sowing division and alienation.<br><br> Nearly 30 years later, it&#39;s clear that the problems I diagnosed in the 1990s ran deeper than I realized, and were more dire than I could have imagined. But the prescriptions in <em>It Takes a Village</em> —putting families first, investing in community infrastructure, protecting kids from out-of-control technology, and recommitting to the core American values of mutual responsibility and empathy—have only grown more urgent and necessary.<br><br> The surgeon general&#39;s warning echoes the findings of other researchers who have studied these trends for decades. In his influential 2000 book, <em>Bowling Alone</em> , the Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam showed that Americans&#39; social ties and support networks collapsed in the second half of the 20th century. Many of the activities and relationships that had defined and sustained previous generations, such as attending religious services and joining unions, clubs, and civic organizations—even participating in local bowling leagues—were disappearing. Putnam&#39;s more recent work shows that these trends have only gotten worse in the early decades of the 21st century, and that they go hand in hand with intensifying political polarization, economic inequality, loss of trust in government, and a shift in the national attitude from “we&#39;re all in this together” to “you&#39;re on your own.”<br><br> Murthy cites the work of another Harvard researcher, Raj Chetty, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/socialcapital_nontech.pdf">shows</a> how the decline of social connections between people of different classes and backgrounds—the kinds of relationships that used to be formed in VFW halls, church basements, and PTA meetings—has significantly reduced economic mobility in America. The data show that diverse, robust social networks make the American dream possible. Without them, it fades.<br><br> All of this aligns with the findings of the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton. They attribute soaring rates of what they call “deaths of despair”—including suicides and deaths from alcohol and drug overdoses—to a toxic mix of economic stagnation, declining social ties, rising alienation, and families and communities coming apart.<br><br> The surgeon general points, as well, to the crucial role of technology. He highlights data showing that Americans who use social media for more than two hours a day are twice as likely to experience loneliness and feelings of social isolation as people who used social media for less than 30 minutes a day. As we spend more time online, we spend less time interacting with one another in person or engaging with our local communities. The more we live in social-media echo chambers, the less we trust one another, and the more we struggle to find common ground with or feel empathy for people who have different perspectives and experiences.<br><br> Murthy followed his report on loneliness with a second <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf">advisory</a> just 20 days later, warning that heavy social-media use among teenagers is driving a dangerous increase in depression and other mental-health challenges. From 2001 to 2021, the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db471.htm">suicide rate</a> among people in their early 20s surged by more than 60 percent. For 10-to-14-year-olds, it tripled. These are numbers that should shake us to our core.<br><br> My three grandchildren are too young to experience the worst of this. Still, I can&#39;t help but think about where they and their friends and classmates will be soon, exposed hour after hour to whatever content some hidden algorithm decides to promote. I worry about American children&#39;s self-esteem, their mental health, their sense of perspective and reality.<br><br> The way Americans—and young people in particular—interact with technology today, the way our phones and social-media networks inject bullying, abuse, misinformation, outrage, and anger directly into our brains, is not something any of us could have foreseen just a few short decades ago. When I wrote <em>It Takes a Village</em> , I was concerned about the effects on young people of violence on TV. Now, in the age of social media, those worries almost seem quaint.<br><br> W <span class="smallcaps">hat does all</span> of this loneliness and disconnection mean for our democracy?<br><br> Murthy carefully connects the dots between increasing social isolation and declining civic engagement. “When we are less invested in one another, we are more susceptible to polarization and less able to pull together to face the challenges that we cannot solve alone,” he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/opinion/loneliness-epidemic-america.html">wrote</a> in <em>The New York Times.</em><br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/republicans-ukraine-putin-xi-trump-democracy/622898/">Hillary Rodham Clinton and Dan Schwerin: A state of emergency for democracy</a><br><br> It&#39;s not just the surgeon general who recognizes that social isolation saps the lifeblood of democracy. So do the ultra-right-wing billionaires, propagandists, and provocateurs who see authoritarianism as a source of power and profit.<br><br> There have always been angry young men alienated from mainstream society and susceptible to the appeal of demagogues and hate-mongers. But modern technology has taken the danger to another level. This was Steve Bannon&#39;s key insight.<br><br> Long before Bannon ran Donald Trump&#39;s presidential campaign, he was involved in the world of online gaming. He discovered an army of what he later described as “rootless white males,” disconnected from the real world but highly engaged online and often quick to resort to sexist and racist attacks. When Bannon took over the hard-right website <em>Breitbart News</em> , he was determined to turn these socially isolated gamers into the shock troops of the alt-right, pumping them full of conspiracy theories and hate speech. Bannon pursued the same project as a senior executive at Cambridge Analytica, the notorious data-mining and online-influence company largely owned by the right-wing billionaire Robert Mercer. According to a former Cambridge Analytica engineer turned <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-targeted-incels-manipulate-cambridge-analytica-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-1468399">whistleblower</a> , Bannon targeted “incels,” or involuntarily celibate men, because they were easy to manipulate and prone to believing conspiracy theories. “You can activate that army,” Bannon told the <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist Joshua Green. “They come in through Gamergate or whatever and then get turned onto politics and Trump.”<br><br> Like many others, I was too slow to see the impact this strategy could have. Now the surgeon general is telling us that social disconnection is not just a problem at the margins—not just the usual “angry young men”—but is in fact an epidemic sweeping the country.<br><br> I have seen firsthand how dangerous lies can fuel violence and undermine our democratic process. During the 2016 campaign, a shocking number of people became convinced that I am a murderer, a terrorist sympathizer, and the evil mastermind behind a child-sex-abuse ring. Alex Jones, the right-wing talk-show host, posted a video about “all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped.”<br><br> This was not the first time that I was the subject of wild conspiracy theories or partisan rage that veered into mania. In the 1990s, supermarket tabloids used to splash headlines such as “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/10/the-ingenious-sensationalism-of-the-weekly-world-new/381525/">Hillary Clinton Adopts Alien Baby</a> ” across their front pages. I was even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/08/30/kentuckians-burn-first-lady-in-effigy/0d2ecc75-5341-4a43-8ebc-be91892de988/">burned in effigy</a> by a crowd in Kentucky furious that I had proposed taxing cigarettes to help fund universal health care for all Americans. The president of the Kentucky Association of Tobacco Supporters chanted, “Burn, baby, burn” as he poured gasoline on a scarecrow in a dress labeled <span class="smallcaps">I&#39;M HILLARY</span> . By 2016, I fully expected to play a starring role in the fever dreams of extremists at the margins of American politics.<br><br> But something had changed. Social media gave conspiracy theories far wider reach than ever before. Fox News and other right-wing media outlets gave outlandish lies “credibility.” And before Trump, we&#39;d never had a presidential candidate—and then an actual president—who used the biggest bully pulpit in the world to be an actual bully and traffic in this kind of trash. The results were tragic but predictable. In early December 2016, a 28-year-old man from North Carolina armed with a Colt AR-15 assault rifle shot up a pizzeria in Washington, DC, because he had read online that it was the headquarters of my supposed child-sex ring. Thankfully, no one was harmed. But the pizzeria attack foreshadowed the violence to come: QAnon followers and militia members storming the Capitol on January 6, 2021; mass shooters leaving behind manifestos riddled with misogyny, racism, anti-Semitism, and other conspiracy theories promoted in far-right echo chambers.<br><br> As we look ahead to 2024, the threat to our democracy is not just from more of this kind of violence—although I fear that is coming as well. Many Americans breathed a sigh of relief after last year&#39;s midterms because prominent election deniers and conspiracy theorists were defeated, including Kari Lake in Arizona and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania. But these statewide victories obscured more troubling developments at the local level.<br><br> Consider Peggy Judd, a middle-aged white woman from Cochise County, Arizona, who participated in the January 6 “Stop the Steal” rally and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/012521_judd_cochise_capitol/cochise-sup-judd-spreads-conspiracy-myths-deletes-facebook-after-taking-part-jan-6-capitol-march/">reportedly</a> promotes Trump&#39;s Big Lie about the 2020 election and QAnon conspiracy theories. Judd is not just some Facebook gadfly. She is an elected member of the Cochise County Board of Supervisors. And in 2022, she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/01/1140086777/midterm-elections-cochise-county-arizona-ruling">refused</a> to certify the results of the midterm elections until she was finally compelled to do so by a judge.<br><br> A recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b0NtEWCP5ewYn96RxjvI1kfbc18rOLNb/view">study</a> from the organization <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.informingdemocracy.org/">Informing Democracy</a> identified more than 200 local officials across six battleground states who, like Judd, have taken antidemocratic actions. Many of them are in a position to administer or influence the 2024 elections. They&#39;re county clerks and municipal election commissioners, state legislators and members of canvassing boards. They&#39;re people you&#39;ve probably never heard of who play vital roles in making our electoral system work.<br><br> A hallmark of American democracy is that elections have been largely run by local, usually nonpartisan volunteers and officials. Communities generally <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/">trusted</a> these election administrators because they knew them—they saw them in the supermarket, at restaurants, at their kids&#39; schools. This patchwork system has always been vulnerable to localized corruption and racial discrimination, but most folks who raised their hands to help out did so with good intentions and good results.<br><br> Not anymore. As the trust and social ties that used to bind communities together have frayed, apathy, isolation, and polarization have undercut the old “we&#39;re all in this together” ethos. Instead of nonpartisan volunteers and civic organizations like the League of Women Voters, we have MAGA election deniers and QAnon enthusiasts. There&#39;s now a widespread <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/3669329-us-faces-election-worker-shortage-ahead-of-midterms-due-to-rise-in-threats/">shortage</a> of poll workers because so many have faced harassment and abuse, just for doing their jobs and helping people vote.<br><br> In Fulton County, Georgia, the election worker Shaye Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, who helped out in 2020 as a temp, faced racist death threats after Trump falsely accused them of orchestrating massive fraud. “I just felt bad for my mom,” Moss later told the January 6 congressional committee, “and I felt horrible for picking this job and being the one that always wants to help and always [be] there, never missing not one election.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/indictment-donald-trump-fulton-georgia-mar-a-lago-documents-january-6/672800/">David A. Graham: A guide to the possible forthcoming indictments of Donald Trump</a><br><br> American democracy needs people like Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman to keep raising their hands and offering to help. This country was built by men and women who believed in service, community, and working together for the greater good—pioneers who stuck together in wagon trains, farmers who pitched in on barn raisings and quilting bees, immigrants who joined volunteer fire departments, enslaved people who risked their lives to serve on the Underground Railroad and help others escape to freedom. Murthy and Putnam might call these ties social capital. In the 1830s, the French writer Alexis de Tocqueville visited America and wrote about our “habits of the heart.” However we describe it, the sense that “we&#39;re all in it together” made our democratic experiment possible—and it may be the only thing that can save us still.<br><br> Without a doubt, winning elections at every level is essential. We need to defeat the demagogues and election deniers so convincingly that there&#39;s no room for dirty tricks. And it&#39;s heartening that organizations like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://runforsomething.net/">Run for Something</a> are mobilizing candidates for school boards, county clerkships, and state legislatures across the country. We also need to strengthen voting rights and fight back against misinformation. But ultimately, winning the next election is never going to be enough. We must work together to restitch our unraveling social fabric, and to rebuild Americans&#39; trust in one another, our democracy, and our shared future.<br><br> Although there is an important debate to be had about how much economic conditions contribute to loneliness and alienation, the significant investments being made under President Joe Biden can lift both incomes and aspirations. The historic legislation enacted by Biden and the Democrats in Congress will modernize infrastructure, bring supply chains home, and boost manufacturing in key industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicles. These investments may help stem the outflow of workers and young people forced to leave their communities to seek opportunity far from home, leaving behind friends, families, and emotional and spiritual support systems. Too often, when Americans face boarded-up storefronts, empty pews, and crumbling schools, it&#39;s despair, loneliness, and resentment that fill the void. Bringing opportunity back to these hard-hit places and enabling more Americans to stay and raise families where their roots are won&#39;t reverse the toxic impacts of social media, disrupt the right-wing media machine, or end our political polarization, but it&#39;s a step in the right direction. We can build on that by raising taxes on the wealthiest individuals and corporations to buttress our social safety net and invest in schools and communities.<br><br> In his advisory, Murthy offers other recommendations for rebuilding social connection and cohesion. They include pro-family policies such as paid leave, and investments in public transit and community infrastructure that help people connect with one another in real life, not just online. He has also called for stronger and more sophisticated oversight and regulation of tech companies. In particular, there is an urgent need for more protections for kids on social media. And Murthy rightly argues that we can all do more in our own lives to nurture relationships with friends, family members, and neighbors, and seek out opportunities to serve and support others.<br><br> I offered similar prescriptions in <em>It Takes a Village</em> , arguing that we need to work together to help families raise healthy, successful children. Some of the work I envisioned would happen at home, such as families turning off screens and spending more time together. Much of it would be in communities, with local businesses, schools, congregations, and unions doing more to bring us together and help parents who often feel alone and overburdened. I thought government could help support that community engagement. For example, I was a big supporter of a Clinton-administration program that gave poor families in public housing vouchers to move to safer, middle-income neighborhoods where their children could make friends and find mentors from different backgrounds. I was convinced that we had to come together as a national village and decide that helping all our kids live up to their God-given potential is more important than profits or partisanship.<br><br> These basic principles still ring true, and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/hendren/publications/effects-exposure-better-neighborhoods-children-new-evidence-moving-opportunity">evidence</a> continues to show that this approach works. The children of those families that we helped move to better neighborhoods in the 1990s have grown up to attend college at higher rates, earn higher incomes, and have more stable families of their own than their peers who stayed behind. And the younger the kids were when they moved, the bigger boost they received.<br><br> In recent years, I&#39;ve often thought back to <em>It Takes a Village</em> . The pandemic should have been a case study in how Americans come together in the face of a common challenge. And at the beginning, there was a sense of solidarity and shared sacrifice. People realized that if their neighbor got sick, it could harm them too, and that the virus was striking everyone. The entire village was at risk. We really were all in it together. Tragically, this spirit quickly faded. President Trump and other right-wing leaders politicized the pandemic and turned public health into a wedge issue—a staggeringly shortsighted and dangerous move with predictably deadly results. And when data first emerged showing that COVID-19 was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762908/#:~:text=Approximately%2097.9%20out%20of%20every,Asians%20(40.4%20per%20100%2C000).">disproportionately</a> affecting Black and Latino communities, support for safety precautions and shared sacrifice dropped among white people and conservatives. Instead of a story of our common humanity, the pandemic became a story of our fractured society and poisoned politics.<br><br> I haven&#39;t given up, though. I still believe in the wisdom and power of the American village. I&#39;m inspired by the moms and dads <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/21/1087000890/book-bans-and-the-threat-of-censorship-rev-up-political-activism-in-the-suburbs">showing up</a> at school-board meetings and getting involved in local politics for the first time because they refuse to let extremists ban books from the neighborhood library. I love reading about teenagers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teens-ditching-smartphones-social-media-to-become-luddites-2022-10">turning</a> to old-school flip phones so they&#39;re no longer at the mercy of giant tech firms and hidden algorithms. I&#39;m encouraged by the growing number of companies giving employees <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.maketimetovote.org/">time off to vote</a> and recognizing that they have responsibilities not just to shareholders but also to workers, customers, communities, and the planet. And I take heart from the workers bravely <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/amazon-starbucks-workers-led-union-resurgence-2022/story?id=95090198">organizing</a> corporate warehouses and coffee shops, or walking a picket line, breathing new life into the labor movement and insisting that even in our fractured age, we are still stronger together.<br><br> If you dig deep enough, through all the mud of politics and polarization, eventually you hit something hard and true: a foundation of values and aspirations that bind us together as Americans. That&#39;s something to build on. If we can break out of our toxic “us versus them” dichotomies, if we can shrink our notion of “the other” and expand the “we” in “we the people,” perhaps we can discover that we have more in common than we think.<br> Though we are divided in so many ways, though we are lonelier and more isolated than ever, it remains true that none of us can raise a family, build a business, strengthen a community, or heal a nation alone. We have to do it together. It still takes a village.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/hillary-clinton-essay-loneliness-epidemic/674921/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/hillary-clinton-essay-loneliness-epidemic/674921/</item></channel></rss>
