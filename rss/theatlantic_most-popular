Owades 与芝加哥的 Meister Bräu 分享了配方，从而将其变成了“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4818642458_dc8a10e425_z.jpg">活力十足、强度十足</a>”的 Meister Bräu Lite。 1972 年 Meister Bräu 破产后，Miller Brewing 收购了该品牌，重新配制，并将其重新推出为 96 卡路里的 Miller Lite。这将是第一款真正面向大众市场的美国淡啤酒。<br><br>百威母公司安海斯-布希公司的高管对此表示怀疑。 “我们认为我们的啤酒足够清淡，”该公司酿酒副总裁当时表示。 （2008年，安海斯-布希公司与比利时英博集团合并，成立安海斯-布希英博公司，成为世界上最大的啤酒生产商。）<i> </i>他们很快就被证明是错误的。米勒似乎是第一家发现淡味啤酒的成功与其说是如何酿造，不如说是如何营销的公司。 1975 年，米勒淡啤 (Miller Lite) 凭借一场广告攻势席卷全国，其中职业运动员向男士推销一款口味极佳、口感较淡的啤酒。传达的信息是：男人也可以喝淡啤酒！有效。 Miller Lite 成为热门产品，第一年全年出货量达 500 万桶。其他公司被迫做出回应。库尔斯 (Coors) 重新推出了 Coors Light，安海斯布希 (Anheuser-Busch) 分别于 1977 年和 1978 年推出了 Natural Light 和 Michelob Light。但该公司不愿推出美国最畅销啤酒百威啤酒的淡味版。<br><br> “他们不想让自己的公司就此搁置，”安海斯-布希王朝历史<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/bitter-brew-pb-william-knoedelseder/9780062009272?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>《苦酒》</i></a>一书的作者威廉·诺德尔塞德 (William Knoedelseder) 说道。董事长 August A. Busch III（创始人阿道夫·布希 (Adolphus Busch) 的曾孙）将百威啤酒视为公司的“至高无上的荣耀”和家族的遗产。 “任何带有百威啤酒名字的产品都不会失败。”<br><br>然而，到了 1981 年，随着 Miller Lite 销量的加速增长，压力变得难以抗拒。布希需要把赌注押在他的领头马身上。他委托制作了一种他称之为百威淡味啤酒的配方。 “他在这款产品上投入了一个世纪以来的品牌忠诚度，”Knoedelseder 说道。根据董事长的标准，对配方进行了修改以减少苦味后，该公司于 1982 年推出了百威淡味啤酒，并在体育赛事期间播放了克莱兹代尔马奔腾的广告。百威淡啤（Bud Light）（后来被命名）在年轻和中年专业人士中畅销，但销量仍然落后于美乐淡啤（Miller Lite）。<br><br>超级碗广告改变了一切。 1987 年，安海斯-布希 (Anheuser-Busch) 在一场大型比赛中为年轻男性饮酒者设计了一个 30 秒的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T18XOQppkkY">节目</a>，主角是一只名叫 Spuds MacKenzie 的斗牛犬——“百威淡啤最初的派对动物！”马铃薯引起了流行文化的轰动，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K5BgCI-U7c">戴着墨镜玩滑板</a>，吸引了衣着暴露的女性渴望的目光。 “他是 Spuds MacKenzie，”后来一则广告的旁白惊呼道：“一个热爱派对、充满活力的家伙！” （别介意<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56228/life-death-and-resurrection-spuds-mackenzie-original-party-animal">扮演 Spuds 的狗</a>是母狗。）Spuds 逐渐体现了爱玩的兄弟会男孩的形象，这使百威淡啤有别于更古板的百威啤酒品牌。<br><br>这些引人注目的广告帮助百威淡啤第一年的销售额增长了 21%。到 1994 年底，百威淡啤 (Bud Light) 已超过米勒淡啤 (Miller Lite)，成为美国最畅销的淡色啤酒，并且在所有啤酒中仅次于百威啤酒 (Budweiser)，这意味着安海斯布希 (Anheuser-Busch) 占据了前两名的位置。七年后，即 2001 年，百威淡啤 (Bud Light) 超越百威啤酒 (Budweiser)，成为美国最畅销的啤酒：杂货店和酒吧的主打啤酒、棒球场随处可见的啤酒、大学派对和车尾聚会上的入门级啤酒。<br><br>但淡啤酒市场从来都不是垄断的。如果您决定放弃百威淡啤，那么改用库尔斯淡啤或美乐淡啤之类的啤酒相对容易一些。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://beernet.com/"><i>《啤酒商业日报》</i></a>出版人哈利·舒马赫 (Harry Schuhmacher) 表示，饮酒者认为这些品牌是“可以互换的”：“它们的价格相同，味道也相同。”重要的是顾客对品牌的感受。在强大的营销和忠诚的西班牙裔客户群的推动下，进口商 Constellation Brands 为 Modelo Especial 培养了广泛的追随者。 Michelob Ultra 的销量在最近的扫描数据中略高于百威淡啤（该品牌也属于百威英博旗下），它的定位是一款淡啤酒，适合活跃、注重健康的饮酒者在有氧运动或打完 18 洞高尔夫球后享用。<br><br> “他们永远无法恢复原来的销量，”饮料时事通讯<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fingers.email/about">《Fingers》</a>的出版者戴夫·因方特 (Dave Infante) 说道。百威淡啤的销量在 2008 年<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/bud-light-ad-agency-search-ab-inbev-beer-marketing-strategy-and-history/2421881">达到</a>峰值 4240 万桶，到 2020 年已<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brewbound.com/news/beer-marketers-insights-50-years-in-beer-volume-flattens-suppliers-grow-brands-shrink/">下降</a>至 2570 万桶。即使在抵制之前，“它永远不会成为该国最畅销的啤酒。”<br><br> “当我接手百威淡啤时，我有一个非常明确的工作要做，那就是，‘这个品牌正在衰落，它已经衰落了很长一段时间，如果我们不吸引年轻饮酒者来喝这个品牌，百威淡啤就没有未来，’”百威淡啤营销副总裁 Alissa Heinerscheid 在三月份的<i>Make Yourself at Home</i>播客中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ninesliving.com/make-yourself-at-home-podcast-alissa-heinerscheid-bud-light/">说道</a>。一个月后，海纳沙伊德<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/business/anheuser-execs-on-leave/index.html">被</a>休假，因为公司试图控制反马尔瓦尼抵制活动的影响。对于一个通过鼓励年轻人将自己想象成名副其实的猛犬而建立帝国的品牌来说，她为摆脱公司兄弟会男孩形象所做的努力可能过于艰巨。<br><br>不过，<span class="smallcaps">我们不要得意忘形</span>。正如百威淡啤看似不可动摇的统治地位被夸大了一样，它陷入死亡螺旋的想法也被夸大了。对啤酒的躁动并不是什么新鲜事。 “啤酒酿造业持续了许多类似的消费者运动，部分原因是啤酒在美国人的生活中无处不在，而且很容易辨认，” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/brewing-a-boycott-how-a-grassroots-coalition-fought-coors-and-remade-american-consumer-activism-allyson-p-brantley/9781469661032?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>《酿造抵制》一</i></a>书的作者艾莉森·P·布兰特利 (Allyson P. Brantley) 说<i>。</i> 1966 年，两个总部位于丹佛的西班牙裔团体发起抵制库尔斯啤酒公司 (Coors Brewing Company) 的活动，抗议其对待墨西哥裔美国工人的方式；一直<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cpr.org/2014/10/03/the-coors-boycott-when-a-beer-can-signaled-your-politics/">持续到1987年</a>。 1982 年，杰西·杰克逊 (Jesse Jackson) 领导了一场<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/07/us/around-the-nation-boycott-of-busch-beers-sought-by-jesse-jackson.html">针对安海斯-布希 (Anheuser-Busch) 的抵制活动</a>，以抗议该公司缺乏黑人拥有的经销商。还记得那些争议吗？可能不会。 “美国人往往对抵制活动没有很好的持久记忆，”布兰特利说。<br><br>库尔斯通过创建隐藏企业联系的子品牌来应对这种强烈反对，例如 Killian&#39;s Irish Red 和 Zima。 （合并后，库尔斯现在是 Molson Coors Beverage Company 的一部分，该公司是一家巨头，还拥有 Miller。）“当你站在啤酒过道上时，你必须是一个真正知识渊博的消费者，才能知道这些不同产品的来源，”布兰特利说。这种动态似乎肯定会削弱最新抵制活动对百威英博利润的影响。在美国，该集团<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.anheuser-busch.com/brands">提供</a>100 多个品牌，其中不仅包括 Michelob Ultra 和 Busch Light，还包括 Stella Artois 和 Hoegaarden 等品牌，以及 Goose Island 等曾经独立的精酿啤酒厂。德克萨斯州共和党众议员丹·克伦肖 (Dan Crenshaw) 试图通过<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/dan-crenshaw-bud-light-boycott-17888792.php">展示</a>冰箱里装满来自安海斯-布希英博 (Anheuser-Busch InBev) 旗下休斯顿啤酒厂卡尔巴赫 (Karbach) 的啤酒来蔑视百威淡啤 (Bud Light)。这些钱都存入同一个银行账户。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/craft-beer-industry/550850/">阅读：精酿啤酒是美国最奇怪、最幸福的经济故事</a><br><br>即使是百威淡啤新获得的第二名也需要更多背景信息。报告的数据不包括酒吧、餐馆和其他场所的生啤酒销量，在这些场所，您更有可能找到百威淡啤，而不是 Modelo Especial。 Sightlines 的罗斯表示，从销量来看，百威淡啤“仍然是今年迄今为止排名第一的啤酒”。<br><br>但口味会变。 Schlitz 曾经是美国<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://beerconnoisseur.com/articles/schlitz-how-milwaukees-famous-beer-became-infamous">最畅销的啤酒</a>，最初的百威啤酒于 2001 年结束。Bud Light 作为一个带来派对的欢乐品牌而声名鹊起：<i>我们的啤酒很有趣！喝很多吧！</i>今天的饮酒者往往有更复杂的自我概念。他们还有更多的选择和意见。啤酒存在于一个难以驾驭的世界，任何东西都可以成为文化战争的弹药，无论是迪士尼电影还是塔吉特百货的服装。没有哪个啤酒品牌会再次占据如此主导地位。很难完全了解自己的感受。百威淡啤 (Bud Light) 的设计风格平淡且具有广泛的吸引力，但它几乎不是什么民族自豪感。然而，饮料市场的分裂代表着共同文化的某种丧失。这有点苦乐参半。不过，只是一点点。一点也不苦。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

要求你做的就是“简单地相信”。<br><br>如果这种心理方法失败了，还可以使用臭氧疗法。<br><br> Noom 和节食巨头慧俪轻体 (WeightWatchers) 最近都增加了服务，让他们的客户能够获得 Ozempic 和其他重磅新 GLP-1 减肥药，例如 Wegovy 和 Mounjaro。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-25/weight-loss-startup-noom-is-getting-into-the-ozempic-business?sref=BGQFqz7X">今年春天</a>，Noom 推出了 Noom Med，将其行为改变计划与各种减肥药物（其中包括 GLP-1）的处方结合起来。 Noom Med 将把用户与开药的医生联系起来，尽管它不会支付他们每月经常支付的巨额费用。慧俪轻体 (WeightWatchers) 最近收购了肥胖药物在线提供商<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.joinsequence.com/program/our-program">Sequence</a>

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/02/intuitive-eating/583357/">阅读：最新的饮食趋势不是节食</a><br><br>此举标志着饮食行业的最新重塑——承认对某些人来说，快乐的运动永远不够，计算卡路里是不够的，而像 Ozempic 这样的药物可以成为实现良好健康的重要工具。<br><br>这也反映了饮食世界尴尬而持久的现实：许多肥胖者<i>确实</i>想减肥，但想要变得苗条的愿望却变得有点粗俗。我们应该爱自己的身体，即使我们拼尽全力去重塑它。康奈尔大学饮食行业历史学家艾德丽安·比塔尔认为，这一转变表明，尽管减肥界时不时地涉足“健康”等模糊概念，但“归根结底，大多数人只是真的想减肥。”为什么不让他们呢？<br><br>美国人的节食习惯是溜溜球式的，但我们与节食也有着溜溜球式的关系。在过去一个世纪左右的时间里，减肥行业在道德说教、羞辱和不温不火的身体积极性之间徘徊，这取决于时代的情绪。早期的饮食改革者，比如与饼干同名的西尔维斯特·格雷厄姆（Sylvester Graham）认为，吃得更好确实可以使一个人变得更好、更有道德。格雷厄姆和其他人认为，暴食会导致暴力和手淫等罪恶，正如苏珊·雅格在她的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Year-Diet-Americas-Voracious/dp/1605290114"><i>《百年饮食》</i></a>一书中所描述的那样。格雷厄姆建议：“像对待一个受到良好照顾的孩子一样对待你的胃。”<br><br>第一次世界大战期间，少吃被认为是爱国行为，是为海外作战的美国军队释放宝贵热量资源的一种方式。后来，医生和心理学家得出了（错误的）结论：超重的人很懒，用早期饮食书籍作者露露·亨特·彼得斯（Lulu Hunt Peters）的话说，社会认为体重过重是一种“耻辱”。节食组织无情地羞辱人们减肥。 20世纪50年代初，一个这样的“支持”团体举行公开称重，并强迫体重增加的成员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://responsejournal.net/issue/2020-12/article/reducing-betty-food-suppression-appetites">站成“猪队”，</a>他们会唱一首歌词，其中包括“我们是吃得太多的胖乎乎的小猪，胖，胖，胖”。<br><br>慧俪轻体 (WeightWatchers) 始于 20 世纪 60 年代，当时一位名叫 Jean Nidetch 的家庭主妇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/business/jean-nidetch-dies-at-91-co-founder-of-weight-watchers-and-dynamic-speaker.html?searchResultPosition=17">邀请六位朋友</a>到她家谈论她们的体重斗争。 Nidetch 最终减掉了 72 磅，她将团体支持作为她新计划的支柱。尽管如此，她仍然专注于慧俪轻体的“体重”部分，敦促会员携带以前较重的自己的照片。耶格尔引用她的话：“我祈祷我永远不会忘记我来自哪里。”<br><br>但近年来，节食已经走上了Livestrong手环的道路。杂志<a data-event-element="inline link"

放弃了字面上的“体重”，并将自己更名为 WW，新的重点是“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/weight-watchers-changes-name-as-it-shifts-mission-1537807754">健康</a>”。该公司不再要求会员制定<a

表示</a>，“世界不需要另一种饮食”，“健康就是新的瘦身”。<br><br>即便如此，慧俪轻体和其他节食计划通过改变行为来发挥作用，其目标无论是口头还是其他方式都是减肥。 （该公司现在使用这两个名称。）Noom 非常关注心理学；该应用程序包含许多关于压力触发因素、盲目饮食和“行为链”的文章。 “你不是你的想法，而是你想法的观察者，”该应用程序曾告诉我。然而，它也鼓励用户每天称重，记录他们的食物，并坚持每日卡路里目标。即使不再强调“体重”，WeightWatchers 仍然提供<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.weightwatchers.com/nz/wellbeing/evolution-of-ww">锻炼计划</a>和跟踪食物营养价值的“积分”系统。会议被重新命名为“ <a data-event-element="inline link"

GLP-1，您<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/21/well/eat/ozempic-food-noise.html">就不会那么想</a>无意识饮食。 GLP-1 药物 Mounjaro 可以帮助人们减轻<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/06/06/ozempic-weight-loss-ruth-marcus/">22.5%</a>的体重，接近减肥手术减轻的体重。 （相对于手术，人们绝大多数更喜欢药物治疗。）在 Wegovy 中，这一比例为 15%——对于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html">42%</a>的肥胖美国人来说，这仍然是一个改变生活的数字。与节食和运动相比，根据国家体重与健康中心主任斯科特·卡汉的说法，节食和运动通常导致的体重减轻不到 5%，如果加上像 Noom 这样的指导计划，则可以达到 7%。有些人的身体会粘着多余的脂肪；有些人的身体会粘着多余的脂肪。<a

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/exercise-body-positivity-jonah-hill-stutz-ozempic/673524/">锻炼</a>是否有任何意义？ “行为减肥方法几年来一直面临压力，”克雷格-哈勒姆资本集团 (Craig-Hallum Capital Group) 的分析师亚历克斯·福尔曼 (Alex Fuhrman) 表示，他负责体重观察者 (WeightWatchers) 的研究。这些公司看到了 Ozempic 的兴起，希望“自己也能参与竞争”。<br><br>慧俪轻体和 Noom 似乎都承认，仅靠节食和锻炼——他们最近的计划的支柱——对某些人来说是行不通的。这些组织的高管告诉我，他们将肥胖视为一种慢性疾病，有时需要持续的药物治疗。 “早在 60 年代和 70 年代，我们的想法就是人们很坏；他们吃得太多了。他们不锻炼，就会变得肥胖，然后其他一切都变得一团糟，”Noom 的首席医疗官琳达·阿内加瓦 (Linda Anegawa) 告诉我。 “我们现在了解到，实际上，某些人在遗传上容易产生胰岛素抵抗。”这可能会导致脂肪储存异常和食欲失调——GLP-1 可以对此有所帮助。<br><br>对于慧俪轻体首席执行官西马·西斯塔尼（Sima Sistani）来说，这些药物可能是那些无法通过该计划减肥或体重不断反弹的肥胖者的解决方案。 “有些人加入了这个计划，但因为它对他们不起作用而退出了我们的计划，”西斯塔尼告诉我。 “我们必须诚实地面对这一点。现在我们知道得更多了。所以我们应该做得更好。”<br><br>要通过 Noom Med 或 Sequence 获得 GLP-1 资格，一个人必须肥胖、BMI 高于 30，或超重且患有符合资格的健康状况（例如糖尿病）。医生会对顾客进行筛查，以确保他们符合标准。 Sequence 的费用为每月 99 美元，Noom Med 的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-25/weight-loss-startup-noom-is-getting-into-the-ozempic-business?sref=BGQFqz7X">费用约为 120 美元</a>，但这两种费用均不包括药物费用，如果没有保险，每月费用可能高达 1,000 美元。<br><br>令我惊讶的是，减肥医生告诉我，节食应用程序和注射药物的结合可能是一件好事。卡汉警告说，这些药物对很多人来说效果不佳。但像 Noom Med 这样的服务可能会帮助生活在偏远地区或无法联系到专家的肥胖者。 “我们已经增加了肥胖医学医生的队伍，但大多数美国人仍然无法获得一位医生，”他说。 “如果做得好，这些虚拟护理项目可能会非常有价值。”<br><br>尽管 Ozempic 和 Wegovy 等药物可以帮助人们感到更饱并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/21/well/eat/ozempic-food-noise.html">减少对食物的思考</a>，但服用这些药物的人确实必须消耗更少的卡路里才能减肥。这就是 Noom 或 WeightWatchers 等程序可以发挥作用的地方。像 Noom 应用程序这样的应用程序，其中包括关于哪些食物最健康的测验（葡萄还是葡萄干？是葡萄），可能会让服用 GLP-1 的人永久保持较低的体重。减肥药物<i>和</i>更健康的习惯相结合可以实现最显着的减肥效果。毕竟，大幅减肥是许多人的目标。<br><br>有一次，西斯塔尼使用了<i>“体重健康”</i>这个词，我问她“健康是新的瘦身”是否仍然是公司的精神。 “我认为<i>饮食</i>这个词和<i>饮食文化</i>以及它的错误之处在于对瘦的关注，”西斯塔尼说。她告诉我，她很欣赏身体积极性的概念。但她似乎也清楚肥胖的缺点：例如，肥胖会缩短<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://irp.nih.gov/blog/post/2020/01/extreme-obesity-shaves-years-off-life-expectancy">人的寿命</a>，并增加<a data-event-element="inline link"

“在这个框架内仍然有机会谈论幸福以及<i>我如何生活？我如何实现长寿？我怎样才能拥有坚强、健康的生活？</i>你的体重将成为其中的一部分。”<br><br>溜溜球又回来了，我们承认节食者不想道德、爱国或感到羞耻。他们只是想减肥。这种愿望始终是价值中立的。但现在它更容易实现。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊/盖蒂</figcaption></figure><span class="smallcaps">本周</span>，拜登政府非常悄悄地发表了反革命宣言。它并没有用激烈的言辞来宣扬。没有电视讲话或椭圆形办公室拍照——只有司法部和联邦贸易委员会的一份<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-07/2023-draft-merger-guidelines_0.pdf">备忘录草稿，</a>列出了他们将用来评估公司合并合法性的新标准。至少可以说，这不是今年将发布的最精彩的读物。但这可能是最重要的之一。<br><br>受到反击的革命也悄然开始。在新政和战后的大部分时间里，美国政府对合并采取了积极的立场。人们认为，经济实力的集中会威胁美国的核心价值观，甚至引发大萧条。反垄断机构往往对企业交易持怀疑态度，即使相关各方远未主宰市场。这种共识在 20 世纪 70 年代开始动摇。里根时代的到来彻底颠覆了它。 1982 年，政府<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/15/business/us-is-easing-68-antitrust-guidelines-on-mergers.html">发布了</a>自己的合并指导方针，明确表示积极反垄断执法的时代已经结束。<br><br>这在当时不是什么大新闻。今天的孩子们肯定不会在历史课上读到它。然而，政策转变以及限制反垄断法范围的法院裁决的影响是巨大的。此后的四十年里，美国经济变得<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/10/americas-monopoly-problem/497549/">危险地集中</a>，由数量不断减少的航空公司、银行、科技公司和制药公司（仅举几个例子）主导。企业巨头对政治进程积累了巨大的影响力，扼杀了初创企业，并且经常以令人震惊的冷漠态度对待消费者。如果对美国经济生活中的任何失调现象进行足够长时间的研究—— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/health/hospital-mergers-health-care-spending.html">医疗费用失控</a>、婴儿配方奶粉<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6177128/baby-formula-congress-monopoly-abbott/">短缺</a>、地区<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/cities-economic-fates-diverge/417372/">不平等</a>——你很可能会发现企业集中化是原因之一。<br><br>里根派为何这么做？他们受制于这样一种观念：经济政策的最高、事实上唯一、有效的目标是<i>效率</i>——狭隘地定义为最低价格的最大产出。他们相信大企业本质上是高效的。他们在巩固这一观点方面取得了毁灭性的成功。对于两代人来说，无论哪一方执政，他们的效率观都成为竞争政策（以及包括贸易在内的其他领域）的驱动逻辑。对垄断权力如何影响工人、小镇企业甚至民主本身的担忧被排除在分析之外。例如，奥巴马政府<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-08192010">2010 年的指导方针</a>免除了更多合并的审查，并赞扬公司交易“具有显着提高效率的潜力，从而增强合并后公司的竞争能力和激励”。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/biden-domestic-industrial-investment-chips-act/674529/">乔尔·道奇：我的家乡正在接受价值 1000 亿美元的拜登经济学</a><br><br>拜登政府最被忽视的特征之一是它愿意挑战效率崇拜。合并指导方针是迄今为止最正面的攻击。在拜登的反垄断官员看来，华盛顿对效率的转向——这个词没有出现在任何反垄断法规中——用自由主义经济学教授的偏好取代了国会实际通过的法律。新的指导方针试图扭转这一局面。他们并不拒绝经济分析。但他们的指导理论是，即使计量经济学模型承诺某种效率增益，也应该阻止企业获得导致滥用的权力。<br><br>如果新标准追溯适用，近期记忆中一些最引人注目的合并可能不会被允许发生，至少不会没有一场斗争。想想埃克森美孚和美孚、联合航空和大陆航空、亚马逊和全食超市等等。较小的交易也可能受到挑战，因为新指导方针认识到，随着时间的推移，大量的小规模合并可能会积累起来形成垄断力量。 Facebook 可能会被拒绝收购虚拟现实公司 Oculus。谷歌可能不被允许进军数字广告市场。<br><br>也许新方法最明显的例子是指导方针坚持要求政府审查合并可能如何伤害工人，而不仅仅是消费者。这是建立在司法部<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/penguin-random-house-amazon-doj/671973/">成功阻止企鹅兰登书屋收购西蒙与舒斯特的诉讼</a>之上的。在这种情况下，政府辩称，这笔交易会给作者带来较小的进步，因为更少的出版公司将竞争他们的才能。这对作家的影响比行业整合可能带来的任何预期效率更为重要。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">在</span>两极分化的<span class="smallcaps">时代</span>，每个政党都学会了充分利用行政部门的权力。由于无法利用分裂严重的国会来实现其目标，政府只能依靠更加脆弱的法令权力。事实上，里根派通过<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.promarket.org/2022/04/28/a-richard-posner-and-george-stigler-memo-throttling-back-on-antitrust-a-practical-proposal-for-deregulation/">政府备忘录</a>帮助开创了革命策略。他们将合并指导方针视为无需任何实际立法即可改变法律的一种方式。正如一位相关观察家当时<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3480166">所说</a>，“在规范自由裁量权的幌子下，反垄断法正在未经国会行动的情况下进行修改。”<br><br>这种方法的缺陷是显而易见的：任何行政行动都可以被下一届政府撤销。但如果构思巧妙，官僚政策也有可能坚持下去。他们不仅能够克服法律挑战，还能融入公务员文化。就合并指导方针而言，人们进一步希望共和党的民粹主义派系出于对大型科技力量的共同担忧而接受该政策。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/tech-giants-are-dangerous-and-congress-knows-it/614740/">富兰克林·福尔：科技巨头很危险，国会知道这一点</a><br><br>拜登合并指导方针的制定是为了维持未来驱逐它们的尝试。尽管他们的意图很激进，但他们却表现出对司法先例的温和解释。每一项新政策都是对现有法律的忠实表达，并附有充分的脚注。隐含的论点是，反垄断纪律已被芝加哥经济学院的市场原教旨主义者从内部侵蚀、捕获和扭曲。这些指导方针本身只是对最初构思和编写的法律的回归。<br><br>这个策略会奏效吗？顾名思义，该指南不具有法律效力。最终，合并挑战的命运通常由联邦法官决定。就在上周，联邦贸易委员会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/e94b9d46-ae94-4563-b09c-0032a9e7530d">未能</a>阻止微软完成对视频游戏开发商动视暴雪 690 亿美元的交易。做出对该机构不利裁决的联邦法官是拜登任命的。<br><br>批评者还会认为新框架脱离了经济现实，并警告称这将导致价格上涨。事实上，以效率为中心的反垄断似乎在其自身条件下失败了：迄今为止的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262536776/mergers-merger-control-and-remedies/">主要分析</a>发现，合并更有可能提高消费者价格，而不是降低消费者价格。但在某种程度上，关注价格影响是没有抓住重点的。效率是评估合并的最冷指标。它将美国人贬低为被称为“消费者”的程式化经济漫画，将廉价商品视为我们最高也是唯一的愿望。新的指导方针为微积分注入了一些人性。他们认为，政府的最终问题不应该是某件事是否有效，而应该是它是否正确。<br><br></div>

Kennedy Jr. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/20/robert-kennedy-house-hearing/">testified</a> in a hearing organized by Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee&#39;s Subcommittee on the Weaponization of the Federal Government. If the GOP using a Democratic presidential contender as an empathetic witness in a hearing sounds strange to you, you&#39;re not alone. But the choice makes more sense when you understand how RFK Jr.&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/rfk-kennedy-covid-anti-semitism/674727/">conspiracy-theory-laden</a> platform speaks to many voters, and how scores of right-wingers are promoting his candidacy.<br><br> RFK Jr.&#39;s role in today&#39;s hearing underscores his unique place in contemporary American politics, my colleague John Hendrickson, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/robert-f-kennedy-jr-presidential-campaign-misinformation-maga-support/674490/">recently profiled</a> him, told me today. RFK Jr. is not the only 2024 contender who, despite low odds for winning the presidential race itself, has managed to hold on to something of a spotlight—or at least to elicit some fear from the competition. Below is a short guide to some of these candidates.<br><br> <b>The first MAGA Democrat has real support.</b><br><br> Robert F. Kennedy Jr.&#39;s campaign was initially written off by some as a stunt. But Kennedy&#39;s support is not a joke, John <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/robert-f-kennedy-jr-presidential-campaign-misinformation-maga-support/674490/">noted last month</a> : “So far, Kennedy is polling in the double digits against Biden, sometimes as high as 20 percent.”<br><br> Kennedy is “tapping into something burrowed deep in the national psyche,” John writes: “Large numbers of Americans don&#39;t merely scoff at experts and institutions; they loathe them … Scroll through social media and count how many times you see the phrase <i>Burn it down</i> .” And Kennedy is promising to do just that. On the campaign trail, he speaks about collusion among state, corporate, media, and pharmaceutical powers. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/rfk-jr-anti-vaccine-push-white-house-rcna89470">has said</a> that if elected, he would “gut” agencies like the FDA and order the Justice Department to investigate medical journals for “lying to the public.”<br><br> <b>Across the GOP, it&#39;s a race for second place.</b><br><br> Florida Governor Ron DeSantis continues to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/national/">lag far behind Trump</a> in polling because “his basic theory of the campaign is turning out to be wrong,” my colleague Helen Lewis <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ron-desantis-cnn-interview/674751/">wrote</a> yesterday. “He promised to run as Trump plus an attention span, and instead he is running as Trump minus jokes. The result is ugly enough for the Republican base to recoil.”<br><br> DeSantis has long believed that “mainstream journalists are the enemy and should be treated with undisguised contempt,” Helen writes. But his decision earlier this week to sit down for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/18/politics/ron-desantis-jake-tapper-interview-cnntv/index.html">an interview</a> with CNN&#39;s Jake Tapper suggests that he finally understands he needs the mainstream media&#39;s support if he hopes to bolster his candidacy.<br><br> I called my colleague David A. Graham, who keeps up our 2024 election “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/tracking-democrat-republican-presidential-candidates-2024-election/673118/">cheat shee</a> t,” to see how he&#39;s thinking about the non-Trump GOP contenders right now. “Tim Scott and Nikki Haley and Vivek Ramaswamy are all in this interesting place where you could imagine them busting out of the pack to either match or supplant DeSantis as the leading non-Trump contender, but it&#39;s hard right now to imagine any of them mounting a serious challenge to Trump,” David told me. In the end, he said, “it seems like this is all just a vigorous race for silver.”<br><br> <b>And the third-party problem is coming into view.</b><br><br> The centrist group No Labels, whose founding chairman is the former Connecticut senator Joe Lieberman, is preparing to back a third-party presidential ticket in 2024—“to the growing alarm of Democrats,” my colleague Russell Berman <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/joe-lieberman-interview-no-labels-2024-election/674711/">wrote</a> earlier this week. (So far, the group has refused to discuss who its nominees might be.)<br><br> No Label leaders say they&#39;re hoping to protect voters from a rematch between Trump and Biden. “But Democrats and more than a few Republicans fear that such a plan might ensure exactly what Lieberman insists he would hate to see: Trump&#39;s return to the White House,” Russell notes. No Labels says it will decide whether to nominate a ticket in the spring of 2024. The group might be holding out for two unlikely scenarios, Russell explains: that Biden will change his mind about running for reelection, or that “Trump&#39;s legal woes will finally persuade Republican voters to look elsewhere.”<br><br> Meanwhile, a long-shot candidate is inspiring outsize fear in the White House. The academic, civil-rights activist, and Green Party candidate Cornel West will probably not win, my colleague Mark Leibovich <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/biden-cornel-west-no-labels-2024-election/674757/">writes today</a> , but West has Democrats worried all the same. “West inhabits a particular category of Democratic angst, the likes of which only the words <i>Green Party presidential candidate</i> can elicit,” Mark explains; Jill Stein, as you may recall, swept up votes in key battleground states in 2016 that exceeded the margins by which Hillary Clinton lost in those states.<br><br> Democrats&#39; fear of a third-party candidate is not unfounded: As Mark notes, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/third-party-candidate-spoiler-trump-biden/">recent polling</a> suggests that in a head-to-head race between Trump and Biden, Trump is more likely to benefit from the addition of a third-party candidate.<br><br> We may see the first real test of the GOP contenders next month, at the first Republican debate <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2023/07/17/first-gop-presidential-debate-aug-23/70405173007/">on August 23</a> ; Trump is reportedly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-explores-messing-first-gop-debate-holding-competing-event-rcna91292">considering</a> skipping the event entirely. The Democratic National Committee, for its part, will not be holding primary debates, which is the norm for the party of an incumbent president seeking reelection. As we head into this next phase of the election, the race for silver will intensify. And other surprises could still await.<br><br><b>有关的：</b><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ron-desantis-cnn-interview/674751/">The humiliation of Ron DeSantis</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/biden-cornel-west-no-labels-2024-election/674757/">The long-shot candidate who has the White House worried</a></li> <b>Today&#39;s News</b><br><br><li> Wheat prices <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/20/wheat-prices-soar-as-russia-ukraine-tensions-stoke-food-crisis-fears.html">rose for a third day</a> after Russia pulled out of a wartime deal that protected the export of Ukrainian grain, a move that could stoke a global food crisis.</li><li> A planned burning of the Quran in Stockholm <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/swedish-embassy-baghdad-stormed-set-alight-source-witness-2023-07-19/">led to</a> counterprotests in Iraq and the expulsion of the Swedish ambassador from the country.</li><li> New York City <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/nyregion/nypd-george-floyd-protesters-settlement.html">will pay</a> about $13.7 million to settle a class-action lawsuit arguing that unlawful police tactics violated the rights of protesters demonstrating after George Floyd&#39;s murder.</li> <strong>Evening Read</strong><br><br> Seriously, What Are You Supposed to Do With Old Clothes?<br><br> <em>By Amanda Mull</em><br><br><p> In February, I ran out of hangers.

Entire harvests were wiped out, and major roads became impassable. Jennifer Morrison, Vermont&#39;s public-safety commissioner, called Lamoille County “the hardest-hit area” in the state.<br><br> July&#39;s flood is just the latest in a string of extreme weather events in Vermont this year. After a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/january-2023-was-nations-6th-warmest-on-record#:~:text=The%20average%20January%20temperature%20across,their%20warmest%20Januaries%20on%20record.">historically warm</a> January, a late-May frost may have destroyed more than half of the state&#39;s commercial apple crop. By summer, smoke from Canadian wildfires choked the once-clean air. Then, during the week of July 10, heavy rains flooded the state capital, Montpelier, and washed out homes and businesses across the state. It was the worst flooding since Hurricane Irene, a “100-year” storm that struck only 12 years ago.<br><br> Vermont is no longer the haven many believed it to be. And if this tiny, bucolic state isn&#39;t safe, far from the ocean in one of the coolest parts of the country, it&#39;s hard to imagine a place that is.<br><br> Academics have long had an interest in identifying “climate havens”—regions that may be less likely to suffer extreme heat, sea-level rise, and inland flooding as the global temperature continues to climb, and that may have the capacity to accommodate climate refugees. Vermont towns are often on these lists. One, compiled by the Tulane University real-estate professor Jesse Keenan just last year, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/21/climate-change-encourages-homeowners-to-reconsider-legacy-cities.html">included</a> Burlington, Vermont, along with cities such as Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Asheville, North Carolina. And yet, 100-year storms could hit Pittsburgh as frequently as every two decades, according to a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.unionprogress.com/2023/07/16/pittsburgh-region-faces-increasing-rain-flood-risks-as-planet-warms/">analysis</a> by the climate nonprofit First Street Foundation; in the coming decades, Asheville is predicted to be prone to drought, extreme heat, and extreme precipitation. If conditions look this bad in the so-called havens, we&#39;re in for a much-needed awakening.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/heat-dome-southwest-arizona/674689/">Read: When will the Southwest become unlivable?</a><br><br> When you live in a supposed climate haven, it&#39;s easy to get complacent—to think of the climate crisis as something that happens in other parts of the nation. I&#39;ve covered climate change for a decade, almost as long as I&#39;ve lived in Vermont. I knew the science and the predictions: stronger storms and more extreme precipitation events. I shouldn&#39;t have been shocked when the Battenkill River flooded its banks eight miles north of me and angry waters rushed into my friends&#39; homes and businesses—but I was.<br><br> That perception of safety is widespread. According to local news, a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/05/16/nicholas-adams-vermont-faces-a-looming-climate-refugee-crisis/">survey</a> found that one-third of Vermont&#39;s new residents moved here for climate-related reasons. My friend Joe Dickson is one of them. He and his husband used to have a farm in Bastrop County, Texas, an area that was witnessing more wildfires and flash flooding every year. In 2017, Hurricane Harvey washed out a bridge and stranded their community. They moved to Peru, Vermont, only a year ago. After the flooding last week, Joe told me, he felt a “deep and anxious vigilance”—staying up all night to check the forecast, despite the fact that his house is on high ground. It was just like when he&#39;d wake up every hour or two during storms back in Texas, going out to check the rain gauge and look at the creek, waiting for the moment it would overflow.<br><br> Longtime Vermonters have been similarly shocked by the floods. On Saturday, I ran into my friend Brad Peacock, who has lived in Shaftsbury for decades, at our local organic farm. “I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the only farmer who thought Vermont was better prepared for climate change,” he told me. We&#39;re used to living in a northern, nature-forward state with progressive climate policies. We don&#39;t expect to be caught unprepared, as we were during Hurricane Irene and again last week.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/heat-climate-crises-natural-disasters/674700/">Read: &#39;Things don&#39;t always change in a nice, gradual way&#39;</a><br><br> My daughters have lived in Vermont their entire lives. On the day Hurricane Irene flooded the state, my oldest, Frasier, was 2 years old, dancing in the rain at a friend&#39;s wedding while I held her infant sister. We had no idea that soon entire towns would be cut off from the world as highways washed out. But last week&#39;s storm was different. My daughters, now 14 and 12, got flood alerts on their phones; their friends sent videos of water rushing through their houses. After the initial rainfall, we drove north on Route 7A to survey the damage. Our tires splashed through several inches of standing water on the highway. The contents of basements were dumped into front yards for emergency safekeeping. The local park and putting green were completely submerged, and the Battenkill River—typically clear—was brown with runoff, and so high it was licking a local bridge as it roared underneath.<br><br> After we got home, our collective mood was somber. “I can feel myself anticipating something bad,” Frasier told me. Later, as we watched news footage of the flooding on the living-room couch, Zephyr was melancholy. “I feel scared that I have to grow up in a ruined version of Vermont,” she said.<br><br> Vermonters, like other rural Americans, tend to feel a deep bond with the earth around them. My farmer friend, Brad, was devastated for the locals whose fields were flooded. Some “may never get back on the land they so lovingly tended, and that truly hurts my heart,” he wrote to me. “I know what it is like to be connected to the land, and the thought of having it taken away in the blink of an eye is heartbreaking.”<br><br> Around the country, in climate havens and known risk zones, families are terrified of losing that tie to home. Farmers in Georgia are grieving the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgias-peach-crop-lost-warm-weather/">lost peach crop</a> . Homeowners in Florida are eyeing the 90-degree sea, waiting for the day it laps their front lawn. Folks in Louisiana are watching the ocean rush underneath the stilts of a family cottage, coming ever closer to carrying it away.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/south-extreme-heat-wave-texas-climate-change/674598/">Read: Summer in the South is becoming unbearable</a><br><br> In Vermont, we are fixing flooded tractors and raising money for lost crops, donating to farmers and flooded bookstores.

Today, it feels like the nexus of our cultural and technological universes. Rhodes is the 86-year-old author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-richard-rhodes/9781451677614?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em></a> , a Pulitzer Prize–winning book that has become a kind of holy text for a certain type of AI researcher—namely, the type who believes their creations might have the power to kill us all. On Friday afternoon, he will take his seat in a West Seattle theater and, like many other moviegoers, watch <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/"><em>Oppenheimer</em></a> , Christopher Nolan&#39;s summer blockbuster about the Manhattan Project.

(It&#39;s a reminder that his mandate is to push the bounds of technological progress, he explained—and a motivational tool to work 17-hour days.) Since then, I&#39;ve heard the book mentioned on <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/podcasts/ezra-klein-podcast-transcript-kelsey-piper.html">podcasts</a> and cited in conversations I&#39;ve had with people who fear that artificial intelligence will doom us all. “I know tons of people working on AI policy who&#39;ve been reading Rhodes&#39;s book for inspiration,” <em>Vox</em> ’s Dylan Matthews <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/6/29/23762219/ai-artificial-intelligence-new-nuclear-weapons-future">wrote</a> recently. A <em>New York Times</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/technology/anthropic-ai-claude-chatbot.html">profile</a> of the AI company Anthropic notes that Rhodes&#39;s book is “popular among the company&#39;s employees,” some of whom “compared themselves to modern-day Robert Oppenheimers.”<br><br> Like Oppenheimer before them, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt.html">many merchants of AI</a> believe their creations might change the course of history, and so they wrestle with profound moral concerns. Even as they build the technology, they worry about what will happen if <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/ai-threat-warning.html">AI becomes smarter than humans</a> and goes rogue, a speculative possibility that has morphed into an unshakable neurosis as generative-AI models take in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/">vast quantities of information</a> and appear ever more capable. More than 40 years ago, Rhodes set out to write the definitive account of one of the most consequential achievements in human history. Today, it&#39;s scrutinized like an instruction manual.<br><br> Rhodes isn&#39;t a doomer himself, but he understands the parallels between the work at Los Alamos in the 1940s and what&#39;s happening in Silicon Valley today. “Oppenheimer talked a lot about how the bomb was both the peril and the hope,” Rhodes told me—it could end the war while simultaneously threatening to end humanity. He has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/richard-rhodes#details">said</a> that AI might be as transformative as nuclear energy, and has watched with interest as Silicon Valley&#39;s biggest companies have engaged in a frenzied competition to build and deploy it.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">Read: AI doomerism is a decoy</a><br><br> AI boosters and builders would no doubt take comfort in an argument Rhodes once made, in the foreword to the 25th-anniversary edition of his book, that the discovery of nuclear fission, and thereby the bomb, was inevitable. “To stop it, you would have had to stop physics,” he writes. This argument echoes in the rhetoric of bullish AI companies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/29/us-china-chip-export-restrictions-ai-race">and governments</a> who see the technology as part of a global informational arms race. Democratic nations cannot pause or wait for laws to catch up, the logic goes, lest we lose out to China or some other hostile power.<br><br> That idea helps explain why a technologist would construct an AI system even as they believe it could extinguish human life—and so does the epigraph in the first section of <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> . Here Rhodes quotes Oppenheimer: “It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful; they are found because it was possible to find them.”<br><br> As a technology writer, I have spent much of my career grappling with people who possess an impulse to build, consequences be damned. I&#39;m fascinated and confounded by the mindset I&#39;ve observed in AI founders and researchers who say they&#39;re terrified of the very things they&#39;re actively working to bring into existence. I&#39;ve struggled to square this personality trait with my own inclinations: toward caution, toward a paralyzing obsession with matrices of unintended consequences. What is it, I asked Rhodes. What is the unifying quality that possesses people to open Pandora&#39;s box? The question hung in the air, just below the dangling model of the Hindenburg, as I imagined Rhodes flipping through a set of interviews and dog-eared biographies in his head.<br><br> He began to explain. Any great scientist, “before their 12th year,” he said, has “some formative experience that pushed them in the direction they were going in, and made them decide they wanted to go through the grueling process of learning mathematics or science until they could push the boundaries.” Enrico Fermi, the inventor of the first nuclear reactor and a chief architect of the atomic bomb, lost a beloved brother as a teenager, and not long after that, he grew obsessed with measuring and quantifying all areas of his life. “He could tell you how many steps he&#39;d walked down the street,” Rhodes said. “He appeared so much like someone who found in numbers the kind of certainty that he&#39;d lost when he lost his brother.” As a 10-year-old, Leo Szilard had been so disturbed by a Hungarian epic about the sun dying out that he grew fixated on rockets as a way to save the planet, Rhodes said—a quest that, eventually, led him to discover the nuclear chain reaction.<br><br> “It&#39;s no coincidence that so many of the people who ended up in the bomb program were Jews who had escaped from Nazi Germany,” he said. “They&#39;d seen what was happening there, they were all around it, and they knew it was horrible and terrifying and had to be stopped.” Rhodes sees the shadows of his childhood in his own work too, which was marked by physical abuse and starvation at the hands of his stepmother: “It&#39;s not surprising that all my books are, in some way, about human violence and how you deal with it, seeing as I&#39;m an expert in that department.”<br><br> Perhaps this is another lesson in duality—in the grand scheme of things, our nightmares and dreams are of a piece. If there is a concept Rhodes wants AI researchers and founders to take away from <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> , it is the notion of <em>complementarity</em> . This is an idea from quantum physics that the Nobel Prize–winning Danish physicist Niels Bohr, who, according to Rhodes, traveled to Los Alamos to impart to Oppenheimer during the darkest days of the Manhattan Project. In very basic terms, complementarity describes how objects have conflicting properties that cannot be observed at the same time. The world contains multitudes.<br><br> Bohr, according to Rhodes, developed an entire philosophical worldview from this observation. It boils down to the notion that a terrible weapon might simultaneously be a wonderful tool. “Bohr&#39;s idea brought hope to Los Alamos,” Rhodes said. “He told the physicists who were concerned about this weapon of mass destruction that this thing is going to change this condition of war, and thereby change the whole structure of international politics. It could either end the war altogether or destroy the world. The former gave them hope.”<br><br> The grand lesson, as Rhodes sees it, is that you may build an apocalyptic weapon that turns out to be a flawed agent of precarious peace. But the opposite could also be true: A tool designed to perpetuate human flourishing might bring about catastrophe. And so for Rhodes, the true fear regarding AI is simply that we are on an undefined path, that we are moving too fast and creating systems that may work against their intended purposes: instruments of productivity that end up destroying jobs; synthetic media that ultimately blur the lines between human-made and machine-made, between fact and hallucination. “What is most disturbing about it is how little time society will have to absorb and adapt to it,” Rhodes said of AI&#39;s ascent.<br><br> On our way out of his office, Rhodes pauses to show me a jar the size of a film canister with what looks like some rocks in it. A faded typewritten label says <span class="smallcaps">Trinitite</span> , the name for the residue scraped from the desert floor in New Mexico after the Trinity nuclear-bomb test in July 1945. The blast was so hot that it turned the sand to glass. “Pretty spooky, isn&#39;t it?” Rhodes said with a smile. It&#39;s clear to me now why he keeps these relics so close. They are the physical manifestation of Bohr&#39;s philosophy and the through line of much of Rhodes&#39;s work—complementarity as interior design. A reminder that the joy and the horror of both the natural world and the one we build for ourselves is the fact that very little behaves as we expect it to. Try as we may, we can&#39;t observe it all simultaneously. It is a reminder of the excitement and terror inherent in the unsolvable mystery that is being alive.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 20:34:22 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/richard-rhodes-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-ai/674777/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/richard-rhodes-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-ai/674777/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Climate Collapse Could Happen Fast]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> As temperature and weather records fall, Earth may be nearing so-called tipping points. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Z44BwZ1j5uw2VlikZWd-fsZC5gk=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/climate_change_speed_horz_illo/original.jpg" alt="秒表的插图，倾斜并看起来像地球仪" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Ben Kothe / The Atlantic.资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure> Ever since some of the earliest projections of climate change were made <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/warming_papers/sawyer.1972.warm2000.pdf">back in the 1970s</a> , they have been remarkably accurate at predicting the rate at which global temperatures would rise. For decades, climate change has proceeded at roughly the expected pace, says David Armstrong McKay, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter, in England. Its impacts, however, are accelerating—sometimes far faster than expected.<br><br> For a while, the consequences weren&#39;t easily seen. They certainly are today.西南地区在热穹下酷热难耐。 Vermont saw a deluge of rain, its second 100-year storm in roughly a decade. Early July brought the hottest day globally since records began—a milestone surpassed again the following day. “For a long time, we were within the range of normal. And now we&#39;re really not,” Allegra LeGrande, a physical-research scientist at Columbia University, told me. “And it has happened fast enough that people have a memory of it happening.”<br><br> In fact, a growing number of climate scientists now believe we may be careening toward so-called tipping points, where incremental steps along the same trajectory could push Earth&#39;s systems into abrupt or irreversible change—leading to transformations that cannot be stopped even if emissions were suddenly halted. “The Earth may have left a &#39;safe&#39; climate state beyond 1°C global warming,” Armstrong McKay and his co-authors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#tab-contributors">concluded</a> in <em>Science</em> last fall. If these thresholds are passed, some of global warming&#39;s effects—like the thaw of permafrost or the loss of the world&#39;s coral reefs—are likely to happen more quickly than expected. On the whole, however, the implications of blowing past these tipping points remain among climate change&#39;s most consequential unknowns: We don&#39;t really know <em>when</em> or <em>how fast</em> things will fall apart.<br><br> Some natural systems, if upended, could herald a restructuring of the world. Take the Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica: It&#39;s about the size of Florida, with a protruding ice shelf that impedes the glacier&#39;s flow into the ocean. Although the ice shelf&#39;s overall melt is slower than originally predicted, warm water is now eating away at it from below, causing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0">deep cracks</a> . At a certain point, that melt may progress enough to become self-sustaining, which would guarantee the glacier&#39;s eventual collapse. How that plays out will help determine how much sea levels <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1904822116">will rise</a> —and thus the future of millions of people.<br><br> The fate of the Thwaites Glacier could be independent of other tipping points, such as those affecting mountain-glacier loss in South America, or the West African monsoon. But some tipping points will interact, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scientistswarning.forestry.oregonstate.edu/climate_feedbacks">worsening one another&#39;s effects</a> .

The AMOC is like a conveyor belt, drawing warm water from the tropics north. The water&#39;s salinity increases as it evaporates, which, among other factors, makes it sink and return south along the ocean floor. As more glacial fresh water enters the system, that conveyor belt will weaken. Right now it&#39;s the feeblest it&#39;s been in more than 1,000 years.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/ipcc-report-my-climate-tipping-point/619700/">Read: I&#39;ve hit my climate tipping point</a><br><br> A shutdown of that ocean current could dramatically alter phenomena as varied as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/434349-an-urgent-warning-as-a-vital-ocean-current-system-appears-to-show-signs-of-collapsing">global weather patterns</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/homepage/title_772755_en.html">crop yields</a> . Messing with complex systems is chilling precisely because there are so many levers: If the temperature of the sea surface changes, precipitation over the Amazon <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-021-00162-1">might too</a> , contributing to its deforestation, which in turn has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01558-4">been linked</a> to snowfall on the Tibetan plateau. We may not even realize when we start passing points of no return—or if we already have. “It&#39;s kind of like stepping into a minefield,” Armstrong McKay said. “We don&#39;t want to find out where these things are by triggering them.”<br><br> One <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119">grim paper</a> that came out last year, titled “Climate End Game,” mapped out some of the potential catastrophes that could follow a “tipping cascade,” and considered the possibility that “a sudden shift in climate could trigger systems failures that unravel societies across the globe.” Chris Field, the director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and a contributor to several IPCC reports, warned that “at some point, the impacts of the climate crisis may become so severe that we lose the ability to work together to deliver solutions.”<br><br> James Hansen, one of the early voices on climate, says that measures to mitigate the crisis may now, ironically, be contributing to it. He published a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/Documents/PipelinePaper.2023.05.19.pdf">working paper</a> this spring suggesting that a reduction in sulfate aerosol particles—or the air pollution associated with burning coal and the global shipping industry—has contributed to warmer temperatures. That&#39;s because these particles cause water droplets to multiply, which brightens clouds and reflects solar heat away from the planet&#39;s surface. Though the paper has not been peer-reviewed, Hansen predicts that environmentally minded policies to reduce these pollutants will likely cause temperatures to rise by 2 degrees Celsius by 2050.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/heat-climate-crises-natural-disasters/674700/">Read: &#39;Things don&#39;t always change in a nice, gradual way&#39;</a><br><br> Even before the climate gets to that point, we may face a dramatic uptick in climate-related disasters, says William Ripple, a distinguished professor of ecology at Oregon State University and the lead author of a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scientistswarning.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/feedbacks.pdf">commentary</a> on the “risky feedback loops” connecting climate-driven systems. There&#39;s a sense of awe—in the original meaning of inspiring terror or dread—at witnessing such sweeping changes play out across the landscape. “Many scientists knew these things would happen, but we&#39;re taken aback by the severity of the major changes we&#39;re seeing,” Ripple said.

It&#39;s a sweet, funny, shrewd show that also features plenty of full-frontal male nudity. The effect is hard to categorize; <em>Minx</em> isn&#39;t “raunchy” or “smutty” or “filthy” or even “risqué.” Unlike <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/06/euphoria-hbo-review-zendaya/591955/">Euphoria</a></em> or <em>The Idol</em> , it&#39;s not interested in hollow provocation. And the penises that proliferate on-screen aren&#39;t there to titillate, exactly, although a montage in the first episode brings to mind what the French film theorist Jean-Louis Comolli once described as “the frenzy of the visible.” If anything, the show&#39;s insistent focus on male nudity feels impertinent, as though we&#39;re all participating in a ritual desanctification of dicks. The show&#39;s clever inversion of subject and object makes erotica seem faintly absurd: Here are men&#39;s bodies exposed for us to look at. Take away the novelty aspect, and what&#39;s left? What does the act of looking actually make us feel?<br><br> <em>Minx</em> is about Joyce (played by Ophelia Lovibond), a buttoned-up Vassar grad toiling away at a teen magazine while dreaming of securing funding for her austere second-wave-feminist publication, <em>The Matriarchy Awakens</em> . Her side project is the antithesis of sexy. (“Why is she so <em>angry</em> ?” a bewildered executive asks, looking at Joyce&#39;s cover subject, a frizzled activist, mouth agape, raising a fist.) But at a pitch conference, Joyce meets Doug (Jake Johnson, pulling off genial scuzzbucket as only he can), the publisher of a stable of pornographic magazines with titles such as <em>Milky Moms</em> and <em>Feet Feet Feet</em> . Doug is venal but smart; he senses a sea change in the sexual landscape—and an opportunity. To get people to pay attention, he tells Joyce, “You gotta hide the medicine. It&#39;s like, when you give a pill to a dog, you dip it in peanut butter first.” The medicine, in case it isn&#39;t totally clear, is radical feminist ideas, housed within a magazine the pair name <em>Minx</em> . The peanut butter? Naked men.<br><br> The question the show asks isn&#39;t whether the two creators will successfully collaborate—their odd-couple, non-romantic chemistry is far too good not to. It&#39;s whether sex can be used to successfully sell anything other than sex itself. <em>Minx</em> is a sly analysis of the tension between creative vision and commercial compromise, which makes its graceless cancellation feel even more pointed, although the second season was rescued by Starz, and premieres this week. The joy of Season 1, for me, lay in the show&#39;s unabashed championing of pleasure, its irreverent sense of humor, its allusions to fault lines in feminist history. But most interesting was how <em>Minx</em> , like the fictional magazine it was examining, wasn&#39;t just sandwiching subversive ideas together with sexual imagery. It was creating a dialogue between the two. For her first photoshoot, Joyce places her centerfold model, an adorable dodo named Shane, in the middle of a construction site, wearing nothing but a toolbelt, while three snarling women in power suits heckle him from the street. “It&#39;s the ability to look,” Joyce concludes. “It makes a woman feel powerful.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/08/bad-sex-nona-willis-aronowitz-book-review/671123/">Read: How should feminists have sex now?</a><br><br> But is <em>feeling</em> powerful enough? <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crooked.com/podcast-series/stiffed/"><em>Stiffed</em></a> , a recent podcast from the writer Jennifer Romolini, charts the history of <em>Viva</em> , the visionary feminist erotic magazine that helped inspire <em>Minx</em> , and that published Simone de Beauvoir, Lorraine O&#39;Grady, and Erica Jong next to soft-focus images of naked men. At its best, Romolini argues, <em>Viva</em> managed to be a “bridge between feminism, activism, sexuality, and groundbreaking journalism.” And yet, as the fact that you may very well have never heard of <em>Viva</em> attests, the magazine failed. It failed because its publisher, the <em>Penthouse</em> founder Bob Guccione, presumed to know what women wanted to see without actually endeavoring to find out. It failed because sexual representation, for women, particularly straight women, has always been a bind—our desires are often informed by the same chauvinistic terrain we&#39;re trying to transcend. Both <em>Minx</em> and <em>Viva</em> make one thing clear: Men have set the parameters of porn since the beginning.<br><br> <em>M <span class="smallcaps">inx</span></em> <span class="smallcaps">is set roughly around</span> 1972, at the beginning of a moment that <em>The New York Times</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/pornochic-hardcore-grows-fashionableand-very-profitable.html">crowned</a> “porno chic,” noting the prominence in popular culture of a feature-length porn film titled <em>Deep Throat</em> . Early in the show&#39;s new season, Joyce and Doug host the West Coast premiere of the movie, but keep hitting roadblocks: Feminist anti-porn campaigners are picketing outside, there&#39;s a streaker on the red carpet, and someone has replaced the projectionist&#39;s reel with the family film <em>Bedknobs and Broomsticks</em> . (Cue a joke about Angela Lansbury that I can&#39;t repeat.) Joyce, edgy and uncertain about the whole thing, runs into Joan Didion in the bathroom, who helps Joyce contextualize her feelings about a hard-core movie being so ceremoniously vaulted into the mainstream. “Doesn&#39;t it feel like people are longing for a way to be more open about sexuality without asking questions?” she asks Joan. She eventually pulls together an editor&#39;s letter for <em>Minx</em> titled “Why I Hated <em>Deep Throat</em> —And Why It&#39;s Good for America.”<br><br> The episode is indicative of my issues with Season 2: The show is glib where it used to be thoughtful, evasive about the exploitative edges of the business it&#39;s portraying, and seemingly more interested in staging a quippy &#39;70s costume party than engaging with the mission of the magazine at its center. Because as an object lesson in sexual representation on film, nothing is more loaded, or more fascinating, than <em>Deep Throat</em> . For the first time, hard-core pornography came packaged in the recognizable narrative structure of a movie, with dialogue and a plot and a heroine&#39;s journey. Not to mention that <em>Deep Throat</em> was funny, in a disarming, slapstick kind of way. It was sleazy, but not sinister. It made sex on-screen seem accessible to people who would never have been seen dead on 42nd Street.<br><br> More crucial, though, <em>Deep Throat</em> pulled off a confidence trick in plain sight: It disguised male fantasy as female empowerment. The movie&#39;s premise is that its central character (played by Linda Lovelace) has never had an orgasm and is left unsatisfied by conventional sexual encounters. When she consults a doctor, he informs her that her clitoris is actually located in the very back of her throat, meaning that only extremely committed fellatio will satisfy her. “Though it was touted as a celebration of female sexuality, <em>Deep Throat</em> can be seen as a study in the male control of female sexuality,” a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> retrospective <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-SEB-76264">concluded</a> in 2013. Lovelace later wrote in her memoir that she&#39;d been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/28/features.review">violently coerced into performing in the movie</a> . Before any of this, though, the movie was enshrined as one of the defining cultural spectacles of the sexual revolution. Martin Scorsese saw <em>Deep Throat</em> . So did Spiro Agnew—reportedly at Frank Sinatra&#39;s house—and Jackie Kennedy. (In the show, Joyce name-checks the stars present at the premiere: “Warren Beatty, Alans Arkin and Alda.”)<br><br> If the “joke” of <em>Deep Throat</em> was that it told women they could be most gratified and most liberated while on their knees, the prevailing message of the era for men was that objectification could be damaging. That year, Burt Reynolds posed nude for <em>Cosmopolitan</em> , resplendently hirsute—with a strategically placed arm—on a bearskin rug. The caption accompanying the image stated frankly that women&#39;s “visual appetites,” while equal to men&#39;s, had long been neglected, and that <em>Cosmo</em> was trying to redress the balance. The magazine sold out ( <em>Minx</em> ’s first episode takes some pleasure in showing women reading it openly in the workplace). But Reynolds <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/09/burt-reynolds-cosmo-centerfold-game-changer.html">came to regret the shoot</a> , calling it “a total fiasco” in his autobiography and lamenting that it prevented people from taking him seriously as an actor. Still, the image was trailblazing: Prior to the 1960s, as the author Nancy Friday writes in <em>Women on Top</em> , women weren&#39;t even acknowledged to have sexual fantasies, let alone take pleasure in the sexualized image of a male body.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/09/romance-novels-women-elinor-glyn-books/670609/">Read: Don&#39;t call them trash</a><br><br> <em>Viva</em> ’s mission, as Romolini explains on <em>Stiffed</em> , was to capitalize on this moment of flux. There was space for a magazine, everyone involved believed, that would acknowledge women as sexual beings (with high-quality erotic photography) while gratifying their political impulses with articles about the work-life balance, sexual liberation, and the case for not having children. The major hurdle, at least at first, was Guccione, who was progressive about sex and about promoting women in the workplace, but limited by his own sexual imagination: <em>Viva</em> ’s first issue featured mostly images of naked women in the <em>Penthouse</em> mode, along with articles by exclusively male writers including Norman Mailer. “I don&#39;t think [Bob] gave a moment&#39;s thought to what women wanted or needed,” one former <em>Viva</em> staffer tells Romolini.<br><br> Later, when Guccione conceded to demands—including from the woman who would become his wife, Kathy Keeton, whom he hired as editor—and started publishing pictures of naked men, things somehow only got more confounding. Advertisers fled; writers balked at having their bylines next to hazy, Vaseline-clouded photos of male genitalia. Perhaps most complicated, though, was the question of how to conceive of erotic images that would appeal to women. “It wasn&#39;t terribly nuanced—they could&#39;ve done better with the male nudes, made them more attractive from a woman&#39;s point of view,” the former <em>Viva</em> staffer Annie Gottlieb explained in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/books/a19601651/oral-history-viva-70s-porn-magazine-for-women/">an oral history</a> of <em>Viva</em> from 2018. “I thought they were funny, actually. They [seemed like] a man&#39;s attempt to imagine what a woman would like to look at. But, I mean, I&#39;ve seen a penis before. If I turned the page and there was one, I would shrug and turn [to] the next page.”<br><br> Fifty years later, we still haven&#39;t quite figured out how to honestly appraise female desire in mainstream culture—to cater to it in a way that isn&#39;t blurred by what men want to see. The commodification of sex-as-porn is part of the problem—think of the proliferation of the term <em>the money shot</em> , with its presumed primacy of the male orgasm. Although plenty of visionary women are making feminist porn, their work is typically paywalled, limiting their influence compared with the tsunami of violent, misogynist content that anyone, anywhere, can see for free in a given day. “Flesh comes to us out of history; so does the repression and taboo that governs our experience of flesh,” Angela Carter writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-sadeian-woman-angela-carter/9781844083770?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Sadeian Woman</em></a> . Sexuality, she concludes, “is never expressed in a vacuum.” In her TedX Talk, the feminist filmmaker Erika Lust recalls the moment that she realized what porn largely is—a discourse about sexuality where “the only ones participating in the discourse … are men.” It&#39;s not enough, as <em>Viva</em> learned, to simply invert subject and object and assume straight women will respond. There is power in looking, it&#39;s true. But there&#39;s more in getting to decide for ourselves what we want to be revealed, and what we want to reveal in turn.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/11/sex-love-and-goop-sex-education-netflix-sex-positivity/620588/">Read: Where sex positivity falls short</a><br><br> This is in no small part why <em>Minx</em> ’s abandonment of the ideas that made Season 1 so distinctive—the way it interrogated how to <em>sell</em> feminism while honoring the amorphousness of female desire—feels so disappointing. Watching <em>The Idol</em> recently (for my sins), I was struck by how old-fashioned it felt; how in thrall to <em>Deep Throat</em> ’s message that what women really crave, even if they don&#39;t know it, is degradation. Is this what Max canceled <em>Minx</em> for? In the final episode of <em>Stiffed</em> , the media consultant and sexual-equality advocate Cindy Gallop tells Romolini that “any industry that is male-dominated at the top inevitably produces output that is objectifying and offensive and objectionable to women.” More frustrating, though, is what Gallop concludes about the landscape of pornography and erotica, half a century after <em>Viva</em> , <em>Deep Throat</em> , and Burt Reynolds on that bearskin rug: that women have never been allowed to explore human sexuality through their own lens, free of external influences or commercial pressures or repression.

It&#39;s time for another round of Mounting Democratic Jitters, cherished summer pastime from Wilmington to the West Wing. Today&#39;s installment: Cornel West, unlikely MAGA accessory.<br><br> West, the famed academic and civil-rights activist, is a Green Party candidate for president. He probably will not win. Not a single state or, in all likelihood, a single electoral vote. But he remains a persistent object of concern around the president these days.<br><br> I&#39;ve talked with many of these White House worrywarts, along with their counterparts on Joe Biden&#39;s reelection team and the usual kettles of Democratic anxiety who start bubbling up whenever the next <em>existential-threat</em> election is upon us. Even with the nuisance primary challenger Robert F. Kennedy Jr. polling in the double digits, West inhabits a particular category of Democratic angst, the likes of which only the words <em>Green Party presidential candidate</em> can elicit.<br><br> You can understand the sensitivities, given the history. Democrats still recoil at the name Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee in 2016, whose vote total in key battlegrounds—Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania—wound up exceeding the margins by which Hillary Clinton lost in those states. What&#39;s Dr. Stein doing these days, anyway?<br><br> “She is my interim campaign manager,” Cornel West told me this week in a phone interview. Not a joke, as Biden would say. Or an acid flashback. Apparently Ralph Nader was not available. Not Dennis Kucinich, either (already snapped up to run RFK Jr.&#39;s campaign). It might be kind of funny if the stakes didn&#39;t involve a return Trump ordeal in the White House.<br><br> “The fact that Jill Stein is running his campaign is a little on the nose,” one senior Democratic campaign strategist told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/robert-f-kennedy-jr-presidential-campaign-misinformation-maga-support/674490/">Read: The first MAGA Democrat</a><br><br> West has repeatedly denied that he might play a spoiler role. “I would say that most of the people who vote for me would not have voted for Biden,” he told me. “They would have probably stayed home.” In a recent CNN appearance, West dismissed the two parties as a “corporate duopoly” and professed “great respect for my dear brother Ralph Nader and great respect for sister Jill Stein.” This did nothing to assuage Democratic jitters.<br><br> I asked West whether he would campaign all the way to Election Day 2024, or if he might reconsider his venture at some point. “My goal is to go all the way to November,” he said, but allowed that circumstances could change and so could his plans. “I&#39;m trying to be a jazzlike man,” he said. “Trying to be improvisational.”<br><br> In his campaign-launch <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/CornelWest/status/1665743761551548416">video</a> , West promised that his candidacy would focus on core progressive issues such as health care, housing, reproductive rights, and “de-escalating the destruction” done to the Earth and our democracy. “Neither political party wants to tell the truth,” West said, by way of explaining why he is running as a third-party candidate.<br><br> Notably, West has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/CornelWest/status/1678490771228622848">asserted</a> that NATO was as much to blame for Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine as the Kremlin. He has railed against the coalition as an “expanding instrument” of Western aggression, which he says is what provoked Russia&#39;s onslaught. “This proxy war between the American Empire and the Russian Federation could lead to World War III,” he wrote in a social-media post calling for diplomatic talks. West also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/CornelWest/status/1681684210040582146">dismissed</a> as a “sham” a House resolution—passed Tuesday—that affirmed US support for Israel. “The painful truth is that the Israeli state—like the USA—has been racist in practice since its inception,” West wrote on Twitter.<br><br> Several Democrats were eager to tell their own truths about West&#39;s endeavor, expressing uniform exasperation.<br><br> “This is not the time in order to experiment. This is not the time to play around on the margins,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4091419-democratic-jitters-grow-over-cornel-wests-third-party-bid/">warned</a> Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison during a recent appearance on MSNBC. “What we see is a lot of folks who want to be relevant and try to be relevant in these elections and not looking at the big picture.”<br><br> “Too little attention is being paid to this,” David Axelrod, the former top Barack Obama strategist, told me. Axelrod recently gave voice to the gathering Democratic freak-out when he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1677360196845469697">tweeted</a> out some basic historical parallels. “In 2016, the Green Party played an outsized role in tipping the election to Donald Trump,” he wrote. “Now, with Cornel West as their likely nominee, they could easily do it again.”<br><br> In our interview, Axelrod noted that the 2020 race between Biden and Trump, in which neither Stein nor West was on the ballot, underscores how slim the Democrats&#39; margin of error remains. “When you have three states that you won by 41,000 votes combined, you just cannot afford to bleed votes, even a few of them,” Axelrod told me.<br><br> Ben Wikler, the Democratic Party chair of one of these states—Wisconsin—said he expects Trump allies to help prop up any third-party effort as a way to undermine Biden. “Regardless of the motivations of third-party candidates themselves, they can have the effect of delivering net votes to Trump next year,” Wikler said, “especially if a Trump-aligned super PAC pours money into targeted messages,” he added. “And those are exactly the kind of cynical games you have to expect.”<br><br> Cedric Richmond, a former Democratic congressman and White House adviser who recently signed on as co-chair of the Biden campaign, called West a “substantive person.” But Richmond argued that Biden has earned the support of the left through his record on the environment, health care, gun reform, and other progressive causes. “They also know that [Biden] could have done a hell of a lot more if not for this hostile Supreme Court,” Richmond told me. “And they know they got this hostile Supreme Court because &#39;Hillary wasn&#39;t good enough,&#39; because &#39;we weren&#39;t happy and we wanted to support Jill Stein&#39; or whatever the reason was at the time.” Now that voters have experienced a Trump presidency, he said, the cost of casting a protest vote with a third-party candidate should be much more apparent. “I think people have seen this movie, and they know the ending,” Richmond said.<br><br> In recent days, the putative-centrist outfit No Labels—which many Democrats have been quick to <em>label</em> as a pro-Trump collaborator—has been the main source of third-party hand-wringing.  The group is trying to recruit a so-called unity ticket that would appear on ballots across the country, possibly led by Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/joe-lieberman-interview-no-labels-2024-election/674711/">Read: Joe Lieberman weighs the Trump risk</a><br><br> “The idea that a third-party candidate won&#39;t hurt the Democratic nominee is preposterous on its face,” Matt Bennett, executive vice president of Third Way, a center-left policy think tank that lately has been focused on stopping No Labels, told me. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/third-party-candidate-spoiler-trump-biden/">Recent polls</a> show that in a head-to-head race between Trump and Biden, Trump is more likely to benefit when a third-party candidate is added to the mix. Likewise, an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/dems-republicans-are-open-third-party-presidential-candidate-rcna91368">NBC survey</a> from last month revealed that 44 percent of registered voters would be open to a third-party candidate—and there were considerably more Democrats saying this (45 percent) than Republicans (34 percent).<br><br> But Bennett explained that if No Labels does not recruit a serious candidate to actually run, the group will remain a largely hypothetical menace. West, meanwhile, is definitely running. The Green Party has an organizational structure in place in many states that will ensure the nominee&#39;s position on general-election ballots. West has deep roots on the left, and is better known than Stein was in 2016. Like Clinton, Biden has faced uncertainty about how much enthusiasm he can expect from his own party, especially young progressives.<br><br> “博士。 West has a huge following among college-age voters and a lot of folks who are more interested in social movements than they are in supporting Democratic or Republican candidates,” Basil Smikle, a Democratic strategist who was the executive director of the State Democratic Party of New York from 2015 to 2018, told me.<br><br> West was a vocal supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders&#39;s presidential campaign in the 2020 Democratic primary. He has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/11/biden-democracy-penn-justice-democrats-socialists">said</a> that he wound up voting for Biden in the general election because “a fascist catastrophe is worse than a neoliberal disaster.” He also dubbed Biden “mediocre” and “milquetoast” (a tepid endorsement, let&#39;s say).<br><br> Supporters of Biden are hopeful that the blessing of progressive allies such as Sanders, who endorsed his reelection in April, will insulate the president from the threat of West-inspired defections to the Green Party. “What Bernie can do is say, &#39;Look man, we thought the existential threat of Trump had waned, but it&#39;s still here,&#39;” Smikle said. “We need you to show up again.”<br><br> Another prominent Bernie booster from 2020, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, endorsed Biden during a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crooked.com/podcast/the-biden-bump-with-aoc/">appearance</a> on the podcast <em>Pod Save America</em> . The host Jon Favreau asked a follow-up about what she thought of West. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to tread carefully but sounded deferential. “I think Dr. West has an incredible history in this country,” she said. “What he gives voice to is incredibly important.” She went on to slam No Labels as a source of great concern, given “the sheer amount of money and bad-faith actors involved with it.”<br><br> “Not all third-party candidacies are created equal,” Ocasio-Cortez summarized. But she landed on a pragmatic point. “The United States has a winner-take-all system, whether we like that or not,” she said, adding that the cost of messing around could be fascism. “We have to live with that reality,” she said. Live with Joe Biden, in other words. Because the alternative is far worse—not a joke.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 12:40:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/biden-cornel-west-no-labels-2024-election/674757/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/biden-cornel-west-no-labels-2024-election/674757/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[I Watched Russian Television for Five Days Straight]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> My full immersion in Putin&#39;s propaganda<br><small>这篇文章发表在《今日必读的一个故事》中，这是一份时事通讯，我们的编辑在其中推荐了《大西洋月刊<i data-stringify-type="italic">》周一至周五</i><i data-stringify-type="italic">必读的一篇文章</i>。 <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">在这里注册。</a></i></small><br><br> On New Year&#39;s Eve of 2014, I became the subject of a terrifying experiment. On <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/out-of-my-mouth-comes-unimpeachable-manly-truth.html">assignment</a> for <i>The New York Times</i> , I&#39;d agreed to stay in a hotel room for seven days (leaving only for a brief daily swim) while watching Russian state television. Three monitors were arrayed in front of my bed constantly blasting the state-owned Channel 1 and Rossiya 1 networks, as well as the Gazprom-owned NTV. By the end of my stay, I had turned from a happy-go-lucky novelist into a squeaking gerbil of a man, psychologically compromised and barely sure of what constituted reality.<br><br> Now, slightly more than eight years later, I have decided to replicate this experiment. On the one hand, the length of my sentence has been commuted to five days from seven; on the other hand, since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the state&#39;s propaganda has become even more loud, brash, and genocidal, making any length of exposure to it psychologically problematic. But in some way, Russians were preparing for the bloodshed of innocent Ukrainians as far back as 2014, if not earlier. The images of Ukrainians as a bunch of Nazis hoodwinked by the West were readily presented on Russian television. Back then, I did not want to believe they could lead to the massacres of Bucha and Irpin. Today, I know better.<br><br> Day 1<br><br> I arrive at the Public Hotel on the Lower East Side on a cold day this past April. My room has nice views of most of the downtown-Manhattan skyline, which lights up in flashes of pink and purple as the sun begins to set over New Jersey. But I am not here to look out on the World Trade Center tower or the New Museum right below the hotel. I am here to suffer and learn. I flick on each monitor in turn: Channel 1, Rossiya 1 (broadcast outside Russia as RTR-Planeta), and NTV. I settle into my large, comfortable bed; order a pisco sour to be sent to my room (the hotel&#39;s restaurant is Peruvian); and rub my eyes in anticipation. It begins.<br><br> The first thing you notice when you switch on Russian TV is its totemic fascination with the swastika, which regularly appears on one of my screens. Sometimes it is taken from footage of the Nazi era, sometimes from purported videos of the Ukrainian far right. Sometimes it is on the news, sometimes in a documentary, sometimes in a TV drama. By my third or fourth swastika of the day, I start to believe that when the symbol is shown this often, it is not done so entirely with disparagement, but with a subconscious appeal to authoritarian power and to the state&#39;s own fascism.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/putin-caught-in-his-own-trap/674524/">Read: Putin is caught in his own trap</a><br><br> A lot of time on all three networks is given over to flashy “newsroom” sets populated by older men in blazers who scream about the West. <i>Kto Protiv</i> (“Who Is Against”), on Rossiya 1, is one such program. The subject matter is often akin to what one sees on far-right television in the US, the exemplar of which is Fox News. But Russian state television is several degrees to the right of Fox, or even of its more lunatic competitor, Newsmax, although Tucker Carlson, the onetime king of televised white supremacy, is frequently shown on Russian TV as well—or, at least, he was back in April. On tonight&#39;s <i>Kto Protiv</i> , Sweden and Finland are presented as having been coerced into joining NATO. A panelist mispronounces the term <i>LGBTQ+</i> to general laughter. (“Is it plus or minus?” another panelist asks.) Afterward, an “economic expert” tells the audience that transgender bodies have begun to fall apart. No evidence is cited for any of this; it&#39;s merely people talking or, as some like to say, “asking questions.”<br><br> On NTV, another staple of Russian television appears: the dysfunctional-family showcase. “They beat me, tied up my hands, starved me,” a woman from Volgograd cries. “My grandmother beat my face with a metal stick.” The beaten woman, now in late-middle age, is the daughter of a mother of five, who rejected all or most of her children after giving birth to them. The elderly mother who abandoned her children is presented. A woman with a piece of jewelry around her neck resembling a thick chain screams from the audience: “Why did you give birth to so many children if you didn&#39;t have a husband or money? So that they would be orphans?”<br><br> Meanwhile, on Channel 1, a black-and-white documentary shows Khrushchev greeting a group of cosmonauts. The glories of the Soviet past on one screen are contrasted with the realities of the present on another. You may ask why a government obsessed with propaganda would be showing programs about broken families. One reason is that audiences of all nations enjoy watching their fellow citizens in pain. Another is to remind the people that life in the lower depths is a time-honored tradition. The show is presented by two dapper male hosts who are part of a well-trod Russian-TV theme: Provincials in distress are interviewed by stylish urban hosts, as if they are Chekhovian peasants being judged before the district court in czarist times. Subconsciously, shows like these teach poorer and older Russians (the kind of people who regularly watch state television) that they should be ashamed before their betters and that they cannot expect much from life or their immediate families.<br><br> “My husband drank,” the elderly negligent mother explains on NTV. She was a tram driver. Her husband worked in a factory. “He went to prison for three years for stealing a coat. Then he divorced me.” Whereas the manned space flight on Channel 1 was a great accomplishment, NTV is presenting the eternal Russia, which will remain when the glories of the past are left to the history books.<br><br> The old woman crawls on the floor. “Forgive me! Forgive me!” she cries to her children. Now we have left the pages of Chekhov and arrived in Dostoyevsky Land. Some of the audience is in tears. “My fate has been so difficult!” the old mother cries out to them, and to her many abandoned children.<br><br> On Rossiya 1, the topics of Finland and American transgender people are not yet exhausted. On one screen, men are screaming about geopolitics, while on another women are screaming about their destroyed personal lives.<br><br> The show about the dysfunctional family cuts to a commercial for a fast-food chain that has replaced McDonald&#39;s after the sanctions for the Russian invasion of Ukraine were imposed. The copycat McDonald&#39;s is offering an unconvincing-looking “beeeeg speshal roast beef,” as an announcer describes it.<br><br> On Rossiya 1, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is giving one of his usual bombastic speeches: “They want to cancel our country, as they like to say. They&#39;re trying to cancel our country for pursuing its own politics. The West has long groomed Ukraine … Just like Germany invaded Russia.” The television shows another Nazi parade, a long sea of swastikas and chanting in German.<br><br> Later on the channel, we see images of Russian President Vladimir Putin striding through gilded Kremlin halls, while US President Joe Biden is shown tripping on the stairs of Air Force One. It&#39;s an advertisement for a show titled <i>Moscow. Kremlin. Putin.</i><br><br> It&#39;s only 9 pm, but I am exhausted. I have drained two glasses of pisco sour and eaten my ceviche from the hotel&#39;s restaurant, and am blindly watching a movie called <i>Razplata</i> (“Payback”), which seems to be about a drunken man who beats his wife. My vision is getting hazy and my eyes can barely see what&#39;s happening on the three monitors, but I can sense that it is a triptych of a nation that has no idea what it is supposed to be.<br><br>第二天<br><br>“Not my King!” The day&#39;s news begins with anti-monarchist demonstrations in the UK “At least no one is throwing eggs at him like last time,” the NTV announcer intones as King Charles III is booed. In addition to the constant footage of anti-war and pro-Russian demonstrations in Germany, Russian TV is obsessed with the perfidy of the “Anglo-Saxons.” Here the Royal Family is criticized for a variety of sins, such as colonialism in Africa and the 3 million pounds King Charles supposedly received from a Qatari sheikh. Although Russian propaganda normally skews far right, its producers are able to pivot quickly from feigning horror at transgendered people to promoting a kind of Soviet-flavored anti-colonialism. Surely something will appeal to Misha from Murmansk or Vanya from Vladivostok, or any of the more than 100 million viewers who spend an average of almost four hours a day digesting this spicy gruel.<br><br> After the booing of King Charles, the national weather forecast features temperatures in Donetsk and Melitopol in addition to Yalta, all cities stolen from Ukraine. I note that the city of Kherson, liberated by the Ukrainian army, does not make an appearance.<br><br> It&#39;s the weekend, and Channel 1 is showing an endless run of old Soviet movies and army choirs singing about glory. But NTV is skewing younger with a show about women being stalked by ex-lovers. “He&#39;s a professional boxer and he punched me several times,” a woman says of her former boyfriend. “He has a very aggressive nature.” A model is being blackmailed over sex videos by her ex. “Smartphones have made stalking easy,” the announcer intones. “He threatened to knock my teeth out,” another woman says, and we are treated to an array of horrifying bruises. The program notes that stalking of exes by spurned lovers is a problem in the US and Germany as well.<br><br> This may be true, but after watching Russian television for less than 24 hours, I am starting to see a through line here, which is the consistent presence of violence in Russian shows, usually committed against women and children. The verb meaning “to hit” comes up constantly, which makes sense in a country where men encounter horrific hazing in the military as well as a cruel and violent penal system. In 2017 the Duma even passed a law decriminalizing domestic abuse that does not result in the victim being treated in a hospital.<br><br> There&#39;s an ad break for a male anti-impotence drug called “the Emperor&#39;s Secret,” supposedly made in China out of various fungi. “The Emperor&#39;s Secret can be mixed with alcohol,” the announcer helpfully advises the Russian male.<br><br> Next up, NTV introduces an American named John McIntyre who fought with the Ukrainians but then fled to Russia. He has been described as mentally unstable by fellow soldiers and commanders and was allegedly pushed out of the Ukrainian army for incompetence, but in Russia he is a prized asset, proudly wearing his Che Guevara baseball cap and T-shirt. The program intimates that it was a right-wing Ukrainian battalion that caused the well-known massacres in Bucha and Irpin, and not the Russian soldiers whose campaign of rape, execution, and terror was well documented.<br><br> “Are there people like you in the States?” the interviewer asks McIntyre. “There are many pro-Russian Americans,” the young man replies. “American intelligence, they own the media machines. Most people watch CNN, but Fox has the most objective positions.”<br><br> “Their voices are getting louder!” an announcer on a Rossiya 1 newscast booms as older Germans are shown marching in a pro-Russia demonstration. “NATO out of Ukraine!” they chant. “US and CIA out of Ukraine!” Afterward, an attractive young female correspondent brings cakes to Russian soldiers at the front. The war may be brutal, but, for Misha from Murmansk, it can also be sexy and exciting.<br><br>第三天<br><br>Channel 1 is stepping up its game in the propaganda Olympics with a “documentary” series called <i>The Age of the USSR</i> , which blends animation and old footage. The Russian language, the announcer tells us, has no word for “loser,” but instead has <i>neudachnik</i> , literally “unlucky person.” “The loser is guilty for what he hasn&#39;t achieved,” the announcer explains. “The <i>neudachnik</i> is not guilty of a lack of achievement, just a lack of fortune, and he deserves sympathy.” Hence, Russia, a country of poor roads, decaying houses, and abysmal life expectancy, is not a nation of losers who lack achievement, but simply those upon whom fortune has not smiled. In other words: Don&#39;t blame Putin for the mess we live in.<br><br> The program then pivots to Ukraine. “The history of Ukraine begins with the Slavs,” the announcer says. “The territory of Ukraine passed between Catholic and Orthodox hands. &#39;Ukraina&#39; means &#39;the edge of.&#39; The word first appears in the 12th century.” The program takes the view, per Putin&#39;s own “academic work” on the subject, that Ukraine has no history of its own, only the common history of the Slavs. “Their national character is Russian, only in the south [meaning Ukraine] it comes with increased aggression … ability for betrayal, and infantilism.”<br><br> And then the genocidal rhetoric is amped up with an animation showing a half-naked drunk Ukrainian in a pigsty (the actual pig is snorting nearby). The Ukrainian is shown with a haircut featuring a long lock of hair. This hair symbolism refers to the <i>khokhol</i> , a slur that Russians use against Ukrainians. It is equivalent to the worst kind of anti-Semitic and racist slurs. The image of the drunken Ukrainian with his <i>khokhol</i> haircut is no less eliminationist than the “hook-nosed Jew controlling the world” imagery of the Third Reich.<br><br> Meanwhile on NTV, more German grannies are chanting “for peace” in a pro-Russia march, participating, whether they realize it or not, in what amounts to their own Nuremberg rally.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/ukraine-victory-russia-defeat/674112/">Read: It&#39;s not enough for Ukraine to win. Russia has to lose.</a><br><br> As the day continues, NTV presents a documentary entitled <i>I Was Zelensky&#39;s Filth</i> . A young imprisoned woman is accused of trying to bomb Mariupol&#39;s city hall, after the battered city held a sham election in favor of joining Russia. “Mariupol is a place of glory for Russian forces and shame for the Kiev führer,” the announcer declares. That führer, of course, is none other than Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky himself, a Jew whose relatives perished in the Holocaust. The show visits the apartment of the supposed terrorist, which is hilariously staged with an American flag and Nazi memorabilia. Can Sasha from Samara possibly believe this nonsense?<br><br> The program breaks for a commercial for Prostricum 100, another erectile-dysfunction supplement. The bottle seems to feature the drawing of a prostate. Meanwhile, on Rossiya 1 news, we learn that German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz has “fully committed himself to America. Germany can&#39;t deal with the rising price of energy. The Greens are to blame. Germany will be turned into Kenya soon.”<br><br> Geopolitics takes up an inordinate amount of airtime on Russian TV. Russian viewers are probably subjected to more images of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen than their American or European counterparts. The anger at the West is palpable and, as with everything in Russia, deeply misogynist. An NTV host calls Von der Leyen “Macron&#39;s girlfriend” and notes that she has dry skin.<br><br> Meanwhile, Russia&#39;s new Best Friend Forever is Xi Jinping of China. He is presented as a virile and well-armed world leader. Many programs feature Chinese jets seemingly headed for Taiwan. Perhaps to make up for Russia&#39;s increasing vassal status in relation to China, the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko is presented as Russia&#39;s own pet vassal and Putin&#39;s funny sidekick. “Belarus comes to us so many times,” a presenter jokes, “they painted a red carpet on the airport tarmac instead of rolling one out.” (Since June, Lukashenko has gotten a spring back in his step after supposedly mediating the end to Yevgeny Prigozhin&#39;s attempted putsch.)<br><br> Rossiya 1 is broadcasting <i>Moscow. Kremlin. Putin.</i> In today&#39;s episode, Putin visits a train factory! The workers at the factory are shown losing their ability to speak in front of their leader, quaking before the “boss,” as the presenters call him. “Don&#39;t hurry,” Putin says kindly to a worker who looks like he has soiled his pants. “We&#39;re just talking.”<br><br>第 4 天<br><br>There is a sadness to watching this much Russian television. I have started drinking earlier and have switched from pisco sours to vodka martinis. A part of me wants to die.<br><br> But not before I catch Maria Butina&#39;s new show on Channel 1. Butina is famous for being arrested and jailed as an unregistered Russian foreign agent in the United States. Once she was deported from the US, she became a member of Russia&#39;s parliament and, of course, the host of her own TV program. (“Today&#39;s program is brought to you by Erecton Activ. Every woman wants to be near a strong man, strong in every way. Only 2,999 rubles.”)<br><br> Today, the redheaded Butina, wearing an equally red blouse and suit pants, decides to talk about Hillary Clinton.等等，什么？ Who still cares about Hillary Clinton? Apparently, Butina and Tanya from Taganrog still do.<br><br> Tense music begins. According to the program, Clinton laughed “hysterically” when she was shown pictures of the death of Muammar Qaddafi. “What kind of monster responds to a person&#39;s death like that?” Butina asks. A “psychiatrist” appears and says, “Yes, she&#39;s a monster. But it&#39;s because she has had to compete with men.”<br><br> Donald Trump, whom Russian television adores, is shown calling her “unstable.” “What an awful woman,” the former US president says.<br><br> “Hillary Clinton,” the chyron reads. “A shark floating belly up?”<br><br> A so-called expert on America is produced to diagnose Hillary&#39;s early years: “She wore big glasses, she had terrible teeth, and then she threw herself at Bill Clinton.” But Hillary is just the appetizer to the entrée of evil that really controls the strings of world government. That man is of course George Soros. “He helped the Gestapo arrest his own co-religionists and then take away their own possessions,” an announcer says to chilling background music. “George Soros. The spider.”<br><br> Of course, the image of Jew as vermin or as a spider holding the world in its web is typical and, frankly, not even very imaginative anti-Semitic propaganda. But as I watch Butina&#39;s show, I remember that my own grandfather was a Jew born in Ukraine who died fighting Germany&#39;s fascist armies during the siege of Leningrad. A decade after his death, another fascist named Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born in the city my grandfather died defending. Watching Butina and her garden-variety anti-Semitism feels like a terrible desecration of his memory.<br><br> Meanwhile, on NTV&#39;s news program, Elon Musk declares in a clip, “All news is propaganda. People have to decide for themselves.” Russian state television could not have said it better.<br><br> Day 5<br><br> I can almost taste my freedom. The weather is improving, spring is finally here, and all of New York seems to be beckoning me to escape my luxurious prison cell. But I also feel overwhelming disgust, as if there&#39;s a thick layer of dirt behind my shirt collar.<br><br> I watch a show called <i>For Men / For Women</i> , in which a woman is attacked on the street by her ex-husband, who, with the aid of his relatives, also kidnaps her little son. “I fell on the asphalt, and he is holding me down and beating me,” the woman says. “I lost my breast milk. I went to the police. The police didn&#39;t do anything.”<br><br> “Nikolai drank a lot and still drinks a lot,” the woman continues. “He gets aggressive and he takes it out on people. I was his victim and had to obey him.”<br><br> The poor woman&#39;s lament reminds me of the show I watched a few days prior (it now seems like a lifetime ago) about women being stalked and beaten by their ex-lovers. “He has a very aggressive nature,” a woman said of her former lover, the professional boxer. As does Russia in 2023. So many of the shows I&#39;ve watched during the past five days were obsessed with the West, with our Clintons and Soroses and Von der Leyens. Russia is the spurned lover with the “very aggressive nature” taking out his inhumanity on the innocent neighbor next door. Despite all the posturing and doublespeak, Russian television announces as much to the world. Whether on the airwaves or, perhaps someday, at the Hague, the evidence has been clearly presented.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 11:10:44 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/russian-state-tv-putin-propaganda/674755/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/russian-state-tv-putin-propaganda/674755/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Being Anxious or Sad Does Not Make You Mentally Ill]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> We easily pathologize bad feelings, but they&#39;re a normal, even healthy part of human experience. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/tkeNBgph_QyHBm8t_TTrTi1I77E=/0x0:3000x1688/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/HowToBuildALife146/original.jpg" alt="一个人看着自己在水中的倒影" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Jan Buchczik</figcaption></figure> <i data-stringify-type="italic">Want to stay current with Arthur&#39;s writing? <a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/how-to-build-a-life/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/how-to-build-a-life/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up</a> to get an email every time a new column comes out.</i><br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">f you have</span> recently been told that you have a mental-health malady such as depression or anxiety, you are far from alone. The rates at which these diagnoses are being made have exploded over the past few years. A 2021 literature review in <i>The Lancet</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02143-7/fulltext">measured</a> a 26 percent increase in anxiety disorder worldwide during the first year of the pandemic, and a 28 percent increase in depressive disorder. Such symptoms are much higher among some groups, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefire.org/news/blogs/eternally-radical-idea/coddling-afterword-part-1-gen-zs-mental-health-continues">according</a> to the 2021 publication of an extended afterword to the 2018 book <i>The Coddling of the American Mind</i> , by the psychologist Jonathan Haidt and journalist Greg Lukianoff. For example, among politically progressive white women in their 20s, more than half said in early 2020 that they&#39;d been told that they had a mental-health condition.<br><br> The coronavirus outbreak and its associated lockdowns isolated people, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/02/mental-health-and-the-pandemic-what-u-s-surveys-have-found/">causing</a> widespread increases in feelings of loneliness and distress, which still persist. But <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560321000438">some studies</a> have shown that the phenomenon began before the pandemic, so other reasons for it must exist as well. One commonly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.verywellmind.com/social-media-and-depression-5085354">identified</a> factor is excessive social-media use, which can substitute for in-person relationships, intensify social comparison, and elevate loneliness. Still another reason (which I have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/activism-depression-happiness-volunteering/674002/">written</a> about previously) is the increase in political polarization, which can lead people to hate one another—feelings of depression and anxiety are elevated in those who direct hatred toward out-groups.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/social-media-teen-mental-health-crisis-research-limitations/674371/">Read: No one knows exactly what social media is doing to teens</a><br><br> But one other explanation is emerging for the huge increase in population-wide estimates of mental-health diagnoses: the tendency to see stress and sadness as evidence that something is <i>broken</i> inside you. For many who have them, of course, anxiety and depression are medical problems that absolutely require treatment. But other cases exist for which we may have inadvertently pathologized perfectly healthy emotions—leading many people to believe they are ill simply because they&#39;re reacting normally to the challenges in their lives.<br><br> W <span class="smallcaps">hen physical disease</span> is concerned, most of us make two basic assumptions. First, feeling <i>bad</i> is evidence of pathology. You never go to a doctor and say, “I&#39;ve been feeling weirdly good these past few weeks, so I figured I&#39;d better come to get it checked out.” Yet we all know that feeling pain or discomfort is not necessarily a good indicator of what might be ailing you. Often, such sensations are an indication that your body is protecting you—for example, you tweaked your back and it wants you to baby it for a few days. You probably have even experienced some beneficial stress—because, for instance, you worked out harder than normal, and now you have sore muscles.<br><br> The second assumption we make is that ailments are purely binary: You either have them or you don&#39;t. So you might say, “I have prediabetes,” and although that sounds very specific and clear, suggesting that a reliable treatment must exist, what it really means is that you have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355284">a glycated hemoglobin level from 5.7 percent to 6.4 percent</a> . Meeting that diagnostic criterion leads doctors to think that, without some changes to your diet and lifestyle, your level might rise more and create significant health problems for you. But as a condition, it&#39;s not in itself an ailment in any straightforward sense.<br><br> As with many health issues, this is a case of a “dial,” not a “switch.” We treat the condition as if it were an on-off switch because we organize diagnostic medicine neatly around the classification of diseases, or <i>nosology</i> , to use the technical term.<br><br> These assumptions have become embedded in mental-health treatment in ways that muddle reality even more. Positive mental health is defined by professionals and laypeople alike in no small part by “feeling good,” which means not experiencing too many negative emotions such as anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. But as one social psychologist, responding to normative assumptions about the value of psychological health, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.christweedt.com/BoorseDiseaseIllness.pdf">asked</a> in a philosophy paper back in the 1950s, “Good for what? Good in terms of middle class ethics? Good for democracy? For the continuation of the social <i>status quo</i> ? For the individual&#39;s happiness? For mankind?”<br><br> The nosological binary is even more problematic in diagnosing mental disorders. According to the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders">World Health Organization</a> , “In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder.” In other words, seven in eight people aren&#39;t living with a mental disorder. But how would you find out whether you are the one or among the seven? Take any online test for depressive symptoms and you will almost certainly have a positive score, suggesting some degree of depression. But is that level a “disorder” as such? The answer is ultimately subjective: It depends on whom you consult, and whether the symptoms are judged to be interfering with your life “too much.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/depression-screening-primary-care/462933/">Read: Why depression screenings should be part of routine checkups</a><br><br> More and more researchers are pointing out the high costs of such assumptions. To begin with, high levels of stress and sadness are completely normal, even beneficial. They are a natural reaction to ordinary events in life, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/susceptibility-to-mental-illness-may-have-helped-humans-adapt-over-the-millennia/">a response that evolved</a> to help us behave in useful, functional ways. Again, these emotions can be too active, but everyone will have good reasons to feel stress, which helps us react to an event with focus and energy when needed, just as we respond with appropriate sadness when we experience a loss or disappointment.<br><br> In fact, people routinely don&#39;t want to “feel good,” and respond to failure or threat by regulating their emotions downward (in a “negative” direction). For example, in one <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56f5c928356fb063f3e181fb/t/56f5e8db20c64796d519e1e7/1458956508103/Tamir_Ford_2012_landlord.pdf">experiment</a> where participants negotiated with a stranger, researchers confirmed that many of them wanted to feel some degree of anger to be more effective in doing so.<br><br> The dial-versus-switch problem has led some health scholars such as Allan V. Horwitz and Jerome C. Wakefield to assert that the current epidemic of depression is at least in part the result of “diagnostic inflation.” In their 2007 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-loss-of-sadness-how-psychiatry-transformed-normal-sorrow-into-depressive-disorder-allan-v-horwitz/9780199921577?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Loss of Sadness: How Psychiatry Transformed Normal Sorrow Into Depressive Disorder</i></a> , they argue that by assuming that feeling bad <i>is</i> bad, we conflate normal sadness with clinical depression.<br><br> Some researchers go so far as to claim that the whole system of psychiatric diagnosis should be scrapped. Writing in the <i>International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology</i> ,<i> </i>这<i> </i>British psychiatrist Sami Timimi <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S169726001400009X">argued</a> that a label such as “depressive disorder” or “generalized anxiety disorder” “does not aid treatment decisions, is associated with worsening long-term prognosis for mental health problems, and imposes Western beliefs about mental distress on other cultures.”<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C. Brooks? Join him and a selection of today&#39;s best writers and boldest voices at The Atlantic Festival on September 28 and 29.

As my Harvard colleague, the psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, reminded me, a problem of underdiagnosis applies as much as one of overdiagnosis, because millions of people—in the US and around the world—lack access to basic mental-health care. Even those of us who do not have a disorder can benefit from help with emotional management, just as physically healthy people can benefit from learning ways to stay fit and take care of their body.<br><br> The point is that feeling discomfort and seeking help should not necessarily mean that you are <i>ill</i> . You might instead be emotionally healthy but coping with unusual pressures, a period of change, or just, well, life on Earth.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">f you are</span> concerned about your mental health, you should of course seek medical help. As Waldinger put it to me, “Never suffer alone.” You may benefit from any of a variety of treatments, including talking cures and prescription drugs. But here are three things to remember, especially in your lower moments.<br><br> <b>1. We are all anxious and sad.</b><br> Decades ago, the researcher Christopher Boorse uncovered a seemingly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.christweedt.com/BoorseDiseaseIllness.pdf">strange fact</a> : By the ordinary criteria for mental disorders, the population at large is no less disturbed than the population of clinical patients. In truth, this isn&#39;t so strange when we recall that distress is a dial, not a switch, and no one&#39;s dial is at zero. The first Noble Truth of Buddhism is, after all, <i>dukkha</i> —that everyone suffers and suffering is part of the world. But forgetting this is easy when you&#39;re told that you have a specific mental condition, and when you feel isolated and alone in your pain.<br><br> You are <i>not</i> defective simply for feeling distress.<br><br> <b>2. The goal is not to eradicate suffering.</b><br> It is normal and healthy to want relief from your suffering, but futile and dangerous to try to eradicate all of your pain. Think of it this way: When you have a headache, you want a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/08/mental-emotional-pain-tylenol-acetaminophen-relief/671226/">Tylenol</a> to take the edge off, but not narcotics strong enough to numb you completely. Emotional self-management—through meditation or prayer, or with the help of therapy—is like Tylenol, so that you can regain a bit more comfort and control.<br><br> <b>3. Your happiness requires unhappiness.</b><br> The 20th-century self-improvement writer Norman Vincent Peale wrote a wildly best-selling book called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking-10-traits-for-maximum-results-norman-vincent-peale/9780743234801?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i></a> , in which he exhorted readers to start each day by reciting Psalm 118:24: “This is the day the Lord has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.” As a young man, I sometimes did this and gave thanks for the positive, happy things in my life as I did so. Today, I realize this was too narrow a reading of that verse. The psalmist is not saying “Be grateful for the fun stuff” but rather “Be grateful for <i>all</i> of it.” That means both the fun parts I want and the hard parts I need, so that I stay alert, mourn loss, learn, and grow.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/05/dog-anxiety-meds-treatment-antidepressants/674050/">Read: Treat your anxious dog like an anxious person</a><br><br> Some days, giving thanks for the bad feelings is just too hard. But we can at least remember that they exist for a reason; they are normal, <i>we</i> are normal, and we&#39;re all right for feeling them.<br><br> Stress and sadness are <i>not</i> automatic evidence that you have a disorder. They are evidence that you are a living, breathing human being living in a complicated world.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/anxiety-depression-mental-health-happiness/674728/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/anxiety-depression-mental-health-happiness/674728/</item></channel></rss>
