href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/musk-zuckerberg-cage-fight-social-media-supremacy/674503/">在“笼子比赛”中战斗的荒谬前提的同谋。</a>如果您是第一次听到这一切，我深表歉意。<br><br>我驾驭现代生活的总体框架是尝试想象最愚蠢的可能结果，然后确保永远不要对赌。感谢我们的科技亿万富翁，现在比以往任何时候都更难弄清楚这可能意味着什么。马斯克和扎克伯格在伊特鲁里亚废墟中汗流浃背地在付费观看的废墟中互相摸索，是否会构成硅谷男性脆弱自尊长廊中最愚蠢的结果？当然，看到失去平衡的马斯克将他的小脚趾脱臼，撞到给我们“戳”按钮的人的股骨，将构成社交媒体时代的目的论终点。你一定会想！但创新者<em>不断创新</em>。<br><br>无论如何，通过马斯克分享的一些屏幕截图，我们知道两人最近一直在发短信。 “我不想继续炒作永远不会发生的事情，”看似沮丧的扎克伯格对马斯克说。与此同时，马斯克似乎没有注意到，并继续怂恿扎克伯格。有一次，由于一系列莫名其妙的神经元放电，马斯克不仅成功地打字，还发送了以下两句音调诗：“周一我将在帕洛阿尔托。让我们在你的八角笼里战斗吧。”<br><br>从句子层面来看，这些词按这样的顺序串在一起，看似毫无讽刺意味，却很搞笑。从人类的角度来看，马斯克和扎克的笼子比赛是一种令人反感的浪费时间的行为——这是媒体系统崩溃的结果，媒体系统允许那些有影响力和无耻的人随意夺取我们的集体注意力。马斯克和扎克伯格制造了一个伪事件，以增强他们自己的相关性。与此同时，你和我呢？我们是被困在马克·扎克伯格后院八边形里的人质。<br><br>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/28/business/starlink.html">统治外逸层的</a>。从逻辑上讲，它表明人们对这些人在业余时间做什么，以及他们在公共和私人生活中的行为方式感兴趣。亿万富翁的古怪行为具有新闻价值。正确的？<br><br>事情没那么简单。这一集显示了<em>新闻价值</em>的局限性，正如我<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/opinion/facebook-trump-iran.html">之前</a>所写的，这是一种伪装成不可避免的选择。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/trump-twitter-account-special-counsel-search-warrant/674969/">注意力劫持者</a>很久以前就知道，只要他们继续做令人发指的事情，新闻价值就可以让他们有机会留在聚光灯下。这种策略已经变得如此普遍，以至于让人感觉不起眼，但它从根本上打破了媒体现在极其过时的假设，即他们报道的人做事<em>除了</em>简单地吸引注意力和参与之外还有其他原因。薛定谔的笼子比赛是纯粹的注意力奇观的典型例子。这对扎克伯格来说是一次很好的公关，他上新闻的目的不仅仅是通过 Facebook 煽动地缘政治动荡。对于马斯克这个像黑洞吸食星际气体和尘埃一样吸引注意力的人来说，每次提到他的名字——毫无疑问包括在这篇文章中——都比沉默要好。<br><br> <a

的一位高管私下给我发消息说，这样的语言证明我是一个有偏见的作家，对公正地审查该公司不感兴趣。今年夏天我一直在思考这个信息：如果不是男孩子们寻求关注的宣言，谁会如何解释争吵和赤裸上身的口渴陷阱？当科技行业的一些知名人士通过扮演杰克·保罗来分散我们的注意力时，我们如何才能将我们的注意力集中到科技行业的项目上呢？多年来，我与无数硅谷企业家和投资者交谈过，他们抱怨“科技抵制”，即媒体对科技行业及其经营者抱有本能的悲观态度，从而阻碍了合法的技术进步。这些批评意味着我们应该少关注建筑人员的个性和政治，而更多地关注工作本身。<br><br>马斯克和扎克伯格要求我们认真对待他们，将他们视为工业巨头和重要人物。他们要求我们对他们的想法和成就表示钦佩和关注，就像他们的平台要求我们参与一样。但在以这种独特的乏味、愤世嫉俗的方式寻求我们的关注时，他们却在其他人身上失去了关注。不管出于什么原因，这些都是严肃的人，他们似乎太急于向我们表明他们不是严肃的人。有些事情需要改变。我们（而且，我应该指出，我在这里也在自言自语）必须在我们的头脑中持有两个相互矛盾的想法。这些人很重要，因为他们的商业决策必须受到审查并承担责任。但他们的每一句话、每一个眼球表情，都不值得我们关注。这些人可能很重要，但他们并不总是值得我们花时间。<br><br></div>

10,000 美元。但随着时间的推移，许多汽车不再符合资格，使得电动汽车的前期购买成本变得更加昂贵。去年八月的法律解决了这个问题，为新电动汽车和二手电动汽车提供新的、更慷慨的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml#requirements">税收抵免</a>。如果电动汽车似乎突然变得无处不在，这是一个很大的原因。尽管推出这些激励措施的规则需要时间，但电动汽车的购买速度却迅速<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://insideevs.com/news/657660/us-electric-car-sales-january2023/">加快</a>；在加利福尼亚州，每售出四辆新车就有一辆是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-03/newsom-electric-car-sales-in-california-reached-an-all-time-market-share-last-quarter">电动汽车</a>。<br><br>美国终于意识到这些汽车有多么伟大。正如许多其他电动汽车车主了解到的那样，这些汽车的充电成本比汽油汽车的加油成本更低，而且需要的维护也更少。除了更换轮胎之外，我想我总共花费了 150 美元。最好的还在后面：从明年开始，买家将能够在经销商处获得电动汽车退款，而不必在报税时申请抵免。<br><br> IRA 增强了我的电气化之旅。这类房屋装修可能很昂贵，但在该法律的许多条款于一月份生效后，它们变得便宜得多。从一开始，我就知道我想用太阳能电池板覆盖我的屋顶。这样，我就可以为我的房子和汽车产生清洁能源。我还得到了一个插入太阳能电池板的电池，这样我就可以在夜间和停电期间获得备用能源。爱尔兰共和军延长了已有数十年历史的太阳能电池板<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics">折扣</a>，并将其也应用于电池成本。这实际上使整个系统的成本降低了 30%。<br><br>一次又一次，我收到了折扣。我的愿望清单中最重要的是热泵。这些机器就像魔法一样：它们从室外空气中吸收热量（即使在冬天！）来加热水，或加热和冷却家里的空气，而不直接使用任何化石燃料。一月份，我安装了两台热泵——一台用于水，一台用于空气——明年我将收回 2,000 美元的税款。去年，热泵的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/22/climate/heat-pumps-extreme-cold.html">销量超过了</a>燃气炉，爱尔兰共和军无疑将大幅提高这一利润率。<br><br>房子里装满了太阳能电池板和热泵，我的目标终于在眼前了。我做出的最后也是最重要的决定之一是将燃气灶更换为电磁炉和电烤箱。从碳污染的角度来看，这并不是最大的项目。但为了我家人的健康，这是至关重要的。几个月前，我买了一台小型空气质量<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-monitors">监测仪</a>，开始亲眼观察<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/17/climate/gas-stoves-benzene-cigarettes.html">科学家</a>告诉我们的：用煤气灶做饭，从某些方面来说，与二手烟相当。没有人会“拿走燃气灶”，但如果你有的话，你可能会考虑更换它。你的肺会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gas-stoves-emit-more-of-the-carcinogen-benzene-than-expected/">感谢你的</a>。有了电磁炉，我的家更健康了。我有没有提到它煮水的速度更快？难怪许多<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/01/gas-stove-asthma-danger-ban-debate/672725/">厨师</a>都喜欢它们。他们更好。<br><br>上个月，当我收到 SoCalGas 的退款支票时，我知道我终于做到了。我已经切断了与公司的最后联系。多亏了爱尔兰共和军，让我的家完全通电比我想象的要容易：当我明年报税时，我将节省数千美元。但我的家只是这个国家的一个。如果我们想实现我们的气候目标，我们将需要更多的人以更快的速度实现全电动化。据我担任高级顾问的电气化非营利组织 Rewiring America 称，未来三年，我们需要联邦法律刺激额外<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/pace">1400 万辆</a>清洁能源的购买：热泵、太阳能电池板、电动汽车等。未来选择家庭清洁能源尤为重要。随着气候变化的加速，我们的家园正成为更加重要的避难所。临近 7 月底，近<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/news-wrap-nearly-200-million-americans-face-extreme-heat-severe-weather">2 亿</a>美国人收到了高温或极端天气警告；一个月前， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/27/us/canada-wildfire-smoke-great-lakes/index.html">1.2亿</a>人笼罩在浓烟之中。<br><br>即使有了爱尔兰共和军，像我这样的电气化之旅也可能充满挑战。弄清楚要购买哪些机器、寻找承包商以及支付新设备的前期成本<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/my-home">可能是一个沉重的负担。</a>就我而言，暖通空调技术人员非常难以确定，导致我的热泵安装延迟了数周。这是一种常见的经历，因为技术工人<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dept-of-energy/the-great-electrician-shortage">短缺</a>。其他房主<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/02/28/how-to-get-heat-pump-home/">发现</a>，一些不熟悉现代技术的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2022/10/8/23387530/home-electrification-heat-pumps-gas-furnace-contractors">承包商</a>不断推荐煤气炉，即使客户说他们不需要煤气炉。显然，我们有办法继续建设电气化劳动力队伍，但不幸的是，这并不是 IRA 资金的重点。<br><br>尽管 IRA 有帮助，但更换所有这些电机的成本很高。我们不能只为富裕家庭提供电力，而让弱势社区依赖化石天然气，而随着越来越多的人退出该系统，其<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fordschool.umich.edu/news/2021/poor-urban-rural-areas-could-bear-financial-burden-move-natural-gas-electricity-energy">成本</a>只会增加。该法律延续了严重依赖税收抵免来支持清洁技术（包括电动汽车和太阳能电池板）的模式。对于许多家庭来说，等待一年多才能拿回钱是一个艰难的提议，甚至在你考虑报税有多么复杂之前也是如此。因此，大多数太阳能的采用都发生在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://electrek.co/2022/11/04/us-rooftop-solar-adoption-income/">较富裕的</a>家庭中。<br><br>随着时间的推移，这种技术应该会变得更便宜。 IRA 包括为低收入和弱势社区提供约 500 亿美元的资金。大多数家庭很快还将能够获得超过 10,000 美元的资金来安装气候友好型设施，包括隔热材料和电磁炉。此外，还有额外 70 亿美元用于希望安装<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-launches-7-billion-solar-all-grant-competition-fund#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(June%2028%2C%202023),millions%20of%20low%2Dincome%20households.">太阳能</a>电池板的低收入家庭。 IRA 的出色之处在于，该法律旨在在美国建立清洁制造，这将刺激创新并降低成本。<br><br>一年后，爱尔兰共和军就像一个刚学步的婴儿：现在判断它会如何成长还为时过早，但到目前为止的迹象是有希望的。我们可以从数字中看到，现在有更多的电动汽车和更多的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-solar-power-installations-soar-q1-easing-panel-import-gridlock-2023-06-08/">太阳能电池板</a>，是的，还有更多的热泵。但法律的意义远大于消费者对清洁机器的激励措施。它还正在重塑<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://climatepower.us/clean-energy-boom/">经济</a>，创造超过 170,000 个新就业机会，并为电池制造、风力涡轮机工厂和太阳能制造工厂带来 2780 亿美元的新投资。再过十年，爱尔兰共和军虽然并不完美，但可能会成为美国与化石燃料关系的转折点。由于这项法律，数百万人的家庭将实现电气化，而我们与天然气公司的旧关系将成为遥远的、糟糕的记忆。当我们回顾过去时，我们会想：<em>为什么我们要忍受他们这么久？</em><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 19:57:00

Seen]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>为极限运动员重新设计了一款经典玩具。它也能吸引普通人吗？ <br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>本·弗兰克摄</figcaption></figure>2022 年 6 月的最后一个星期五，匹兹堡市中心酷热难耐，来自田纳西州的道尔顿·史密斯 (Dalton Smith) 25 岁，站在集市广场约 100 人的人群中间，将头盔带扣到位。 ，然后爬到他的弹簧单高跷上。他紧紧抓住两个车把，运动鞋搁在固定在铝制圆筒底部的两个钉子上。然后他开始弹跳。他小小一跳，然后一大跳，他的身体腾空而起。就在这时，史密斯把运动鞋从钉子上脱下来，像飞机螺旋桨一样在他面前顺时针旋转棍子，同时越过了位于空中 12 英尺的单杠。<br><br>当史密斯成功降落在另一边时，他创造了单高跷上最高跳跃的吉尼斯世界纪录。他在 Vurtego 上做到了这一点，这也许是世界上有史以来最伟大的单高跷。 “正是魔杖让魔法成为可能，”现年 26 岁的史密斯今年夏天告诉我。<br><br>我们许多人都熟悉的弹簧装置在第一次世界大战后不久就在美国推出。近 100 年来，这种简单的弹簧单高跷并没有发生太大变化。但是，当两个从小一起冲浪、滑板和单板滑雪长大的高中好友在聚会上看到一个朋友摆弄他的旧弹簧单高跷时，他们开始思考：<em>有没有办法为极限运动世界重新设计一个童年玩具？</em>于是，Vurtego 弹簧单高跷诞生了，它以加利福尼亚州 Mission Viejo 的公司命名，该公司自 2005 年起开始生产弹簧单高跷。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/07/how-to-take-smart-risks/661487/">阅读：一点危险的魔力</a><br><br>与弹簧支撑杆不同，Vurtego 的设备由空气提供动力，其轴可以从空心金属管中泵入和泵出。 Vurtego 操纵杆内的气压很容易达到标准汽车轮胎 PSI 的两倍，这意味着单次弹跳即可将骑手抛向超过 8 英尺的空中。这项创新催生了trick pogo，这是一项以名为 Pogopalooza 的年度比赛为中心的小众极限运动。但它也让Vurtego陷入了一个充满挑战的境地：它必须把这款产品卖给那些不想在令人窒息的海拔高度移动的人。<br><br>作为一项业务当务之急，这是 Vurtego 必须解决的一个难题，当它在 9 月份开始销售 Slingshot 时，它将尝试解决这个难题。弹弓是一种更短、更轻、更容易控制的弹簧单高跷，但它仍然由空气提供动力。如果说 Vurtego 是一辆跑车，那么 Slingshot 就是任何人都可以驾驶的轿车。 Vurtego 表示，其目标是吸引更广泛的受众：那些想要比弹簧杆所能提供的更多刺激的孩子，但也包括任何愿意尝试新事物的人。然而，商业动机掩盖了一个更根本的问题：为什么要跳上弹簧单高跷？<br><br>对于史密斯来说，弹簧单高跷唤起了童年的纯真，那时你唯一需要担心的是你能跳多高（以及如果弹簧开始横向移动如何有效地跳出）。 “当你跳上弹簧单高跷时，你无法不感觉自己像个孩子，”他告诉我。 “我感觉自己充满活力、年轻、快乐。它让你的整个身体都兴奋起来，享受身体上的快乐。”<br><br>老式的弹簧棍通常只能弹到空中几英尺。 Vurtego 联合创始人 Ian Britt 参与制造的第一根弹簧支撑杆可以让骑手达到五英尺高。这种不优雅的设计——他和一个伙伴将两个旧汽车减震器焊接在一起并卡在金属管内——产生了一个笨重的 60 磅重的装置，但它仍然能够实现更高的弹跳。共同的朋友将 Britt 与 Vurtego 的另一位联合创始人 Brian Spencer 联系起来，Brian Spencer 的叔叔是一位前航空航天工程师，他做出了关键贡献：用空气代替了弹簧。为了使弹簧棒达到世界纪录的高度，您需要具有较厚规格的金属，这会减轻弹簧棒的重量。压缩空气更轻，可以使用自行车打气筒即时调节。这就是允许疯狂高度的原因：更大的气压等于更高的高度。<br><br> Pogopalooza 的大多数运动员使用的 Vurtego 球杆是 V4，它是该公司的特技 pogo 设备系列中的最新产品。尽管像史密斯这样的特技演员的表演令人叹为观止——你<em>见过</em>有人<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/ajzaleski/status/1564945715029237761">在弹簧单高跷上做三个后空翻</a>吗？——V4 本身对大众来说是难以接触到的。气缸为铝制，轴为重型不锈钢，pogo 从轴到车把高超过四英尺，价格为 499 美元。<br><br>相比之下，Slingshot 的售价为 149 美元或 159 美元，具体取决于型号尺寸：超小号或小号。 Vurtego 在过去几年才能够获得的材料使设计得以实现。该棒中的圆柱体由六层压延铝制成。轴是铝制的。这些钉子是热塑性塑料和尼龙的特殊混合物，并插入玻璃纤维以增加强度。 pogo 本身更短。与史密斯描述的“超级有力和罂粟花”的 V4 不同，据尝试过 Slingshot 的人说，Slingshot 的弹跳缓慢且有缓冲。<br><br>总部位于匹兹堡的管理机构 Xpogo 的首席执行官兼联合创始人威尔·韦纳 (Will Weiner) 表示：“从弹弓之类的东西开始就不那么令人生畏了，看起来你不会自动折断骨头。”举办一年一度的高空飞行比赛的特技波戈机构。 “我真的认为这是我们一直在寻找的缺失环节。”<br><br>让人们接受 pogo 作为一种休闲活动似乎不太可能。如果说有什么不同的话，那就是弹弓似乎更适合那些喜欢玩技巧棒的人，即还没有准备好接受更大的弹簧单高跷的震动的年轻一代。<br><br>这是有道理的。为什么要给一个 10 岁的孩子一根弹簧单高跷，因为让他们脸朝下摔到人行道上就会错误地弹起呢？布里特告诉我，Slingshot 只是 Vurtego 计划推出的两款新弹簧单高跷中的第一个。明年春天，该公司将发布 V5，这是 Pogopalooza 套装的最新款球杆，它将融合弹弓的更柔和、蹦床般的弹力。事实上，V5 的早期测试模型是史密斯一年前用来达到跳高目标的模型。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/06/extreme-heat-events-summer-vacation-kids/674401/">阅读：暑假搬到室内</a><br><br>但是，使弹弓成为可能更容易的弹簧单高跷的原因，与它不仅仅是一组为有抱负的后空翻运动员准备的垂直训练轮的原因相同：任何人都可以在上面跳跃。这使它成为通向无组织、怀旧乐趣的大门，摆脱日常生活中沉重的沉思压力。<br><br> “如果你去滑雪，大多数人都会去兔子坡。在地形公园里飞行的人并不多，”布里特说。 “大多数人只是想上山，喝几杯啤酒，放松一下，玩得开心。这是我们的版本。”<br><br>一根新的弹簧单高跷之所以重要，是因为它总体上<em>微不足道</em>：在沉重的世界中只有一点点浮力。就在我观察匹兹堡的场景之前不久，我发现自己患有一种特殊类型的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.gq.com/story/muscular-dystrophy-wellness">肌肉萎缩</a>症，这是一种导致我的身体逐渐崩溃的退行性疾病。我永远不会在 Vurtego 或 Slingshot 或任何其他东西上弹跳，但我可以欣赏它们所代表的意义。亲眼目睹 pogo 特技让我对轻浮有了新的认识。<br><br>史密斯将他在弹簧单高跷上的时光视为通往想象力的桥梁。他记得当他第一次开始观看其他人在弹簧单高跷上表演特技的 YouTube 视频时，然后尝试模仿他所看到的。他说，这个行为就像扮演一个角色。 “这在某种程度上很荒谬，但又很有趣，”他说。 “这就是怀旧、年轻和天真的感觉的根源。”<br><br>今年夏天，他在佛罗里达州的乐高乐园度过了几个月，参加了一场有剧本的体育表演。他带着他的 Vurtego 在舞台上跳跃，扮演“迈克”，一名手提钻操作员。当然，弹簧单高跷就是手提钻。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 18:57:24

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>伊芙琳霍克斯坦/路透社</figcaption></figure>在爱荷华州博览会上，我附近的人们都很疯狂。 “你看到他了吗？”他们气喘吁吁。 “你认为他会到人群中讲话吗？”当特勤局官员明确表示前总统唐纳德·特朗普将出现在大广场的 Steer &#39;N Stein 餐厅时，展会上的人们排起了长队，队伍的尽头在视线之外。<br><br>并不是所有的人都能挤进餐厅，所以他们挤满了外面的街道，一大群热切、满头大汗的爱荷华人。当这位前总统终于出现时，人群拥挤不堪，从餐厅的空旷一侧几乎看不清他的轮廓。 “你知道，其他候选人也来到了这里，他们大约有六个人，”特朗普令人眼花缭乱的声音通过我们上方的扬声器说道。观众报以热烈的掌声和欢呼声。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/trump-indictment-unsealed-2024-presidential-campaign/674359/">大卫·阿克塞尔罗德：起诉书令人震惊。特朗普的支持者会关心吗？</a><br><br>美国政治中为数不多的能够经受住过去动荡岁月的怪异的规则之一是，任何想成为美国总统的人都必须忍受爱荷华州博览会的众多辉煌和同样多的仪式性羞辱。这是一次重要的试镜，至少对共和党来说是这样。 （民主党最近重新调整了初选顺序，将爱荷华州党团会议的全国第一地位降级。）<br><br>如果一位浑身是汗、塞满了炸黄油的共和党候选人能够激起爱荷华州挑剔选民的兴趣，那么这位候选人就在预选会议上有真正的机会，也许还有入主白宫的机会。有时，一个前景渺茫的局外人可以吸引人群并获得意想不到的优势，就像里克·桑托勒姆 (Rick Santorum) 在 2012 年和泰德·克鲁兹 (Ted Cruz) 在 2016 年所做的那样。<br><br>因此，博览会是一个让人着迷和被迷住的地方。周末早些时候，它似乎发挥了魔力。<br><br> “他真的非常有魅力，”来自得梅因的雪莉·伯吉斯这样评价迈克·彭斯。 “我认为他亲自传达的信息比我在电视上从他那里得到的信息要清晰得多。”这位前副总统刚刚<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kcci.com/article/mike-pence-joins-governor-kim-reynolds-for-iowa-state-fair-side-chat/44794244">结束了</a>共和党州长金雷诺兹主持的几场“公平谈判”之一。这是博览会上的一个新特色，州长会向候选人提出一些尖锐的问题，例如“你最喜欢的罢工歌曲是什么？”<br><br>前一天晚上，彭斯被一名男子质问，“在塔克·卡尔森毁了你的职业生涯之后”，他过得怎么样。另一个人说：“我很高兴他们没有绞死你！”<br><br>但周五早上，彭斯在 JR 的南猪牧场与雷诺兹的谈话吸引了一群尊敬的人群。与会者向他提出了礼貌的问题，六人亲自感谢他在特朗普试图推翻 2020 年大选结果时的“正直”。<br><br>不过，彭斯也有同伴。佛罗里达州州长 Ron DeSantis、前联合国大使 Nikki Haley 和企业家 Vivek Ramaswamy 也在猪肉牧场和<i>得梅因纪事报</i>的 Soapbox 场地吸引了人群。大多数出席的尚未做出决定的爱荷华州人告诉我，他们在 2016 年和 2020 年都支持特朗普。他们说，这些选民赞赏他的服务，但经过八年在社交媒体上的愚蠢咆哮、毫无根据但无情的选举舞弊断言和面对一连串的刑事起诉，他们渴望一些新的活力。他们告诉我，你知道，一个没有那么多包袱的领导者；有人更……优雅。<br><br> “从他嘴里说出来的一切就像是，‘闭嘴，唐纳德’”来自爱荷华州约翰斯顿的两次特朗普选民查尔斯·邓拉普 (Charles Dunlap) 告诉我。他渴望听到拉马斯瓦米和黑利的意见，他相信他们会“制定与特朗普类似的政策”——只是没有戏剧性。<br><br>但周六下午 1 点左右，当这位前总统抵达时，博览会的亲密魅力——深思熟虑、慎重考虑的承诺——消失了。很快我就清楚了，那天早上我遇到的那些对特朗普精疲力尽、思想发生改变的爱荷华州人只是少数。大多数人？他们仍然爱特朗普。<br><br>这位前总统跳过了肥皂盒和雷诺兹的可能演讲时段（因为他与州长的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-feuds-iowa-gov-kim-reynolds-rcna93470">奇怪冲突</a>），但出现与他的人民打成一片。他们挤进了总统可能发表讲话的每一个公平场所。由于他的活动没有任何官方时间表，所以每个人都在猜测。游乐场的部分区域陷入瘫痪。那些只想喝柠檬水、欣赏获奖小公牛的人们感到很恼火。 “为什么我们一定要在所有政客都来的那天来？”一个推着婴儿车穿过人群的男人问他的妻子。 （根据记录，几乎每个爱荷华州人都曾经说过这句话。）<br><br>鉴于他在共和党初选民意调查中遥遥领先，特朗普的出现会引发如此热烈的情绪也就不足为奇了。但看到它，感受到它，却是不同的。相比之下，聚集在一起支持其他共和党候选人的人群似乎一点也不令人印象深刻。突然之间，整个共和党初选都让人感到痛苦的徒劳，甚至可悲。<i>他们为什么要这样做？</i>对于落选者来说——基本上是竞选中的其他人——在竞选过程中遭受的虐待是否值得被任命为特朗普的竞选搭档，即使是最好的情况？<br><br>周六，当彭斯站在阳光下翻转猪肉汉堡时，人群中的人们窃窃私语着他。 “看看他的汗水，”我身后有人说。 “他是个笨蛋，德桑蒂斯也是，”来自锡达拉皮兹的一位名叫雅各布（拒绝透露姓氏）的年轻人告诉我。 “你只是想拿走他们的午餐钱。这是本能。”拉马斯瓦米的个性吸引了许多共和党人，他在接受州长采访后显然觉得有必要表现<i>得不那么呆板</i>，并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5081268/vivek-ramaswamy-raps-eminems-lose-yourself">自信地</a>唱着埃米纳姆的歌曲“Lose Yourself”。一大群银发围观者发现自己被困在舞台前面，不得不笨拙地向前移动。<br><br>德桑蒂斯在展会上遭受的损失比其他任何人都大。当他与雷诺兹交谈时，一架飞机在头顶盘旋，上面挂着一个长长的标语，上面写着<span class="smallcaps">“讨人喜欢，罗恩！”</span>德桑蒂斯假装没有注意到。当佛罗里达州州长在猪肉帐篷里轮到他时，特朗普的支持者聚集在他的拍照区后面，戴着特朗普竞选团队分发的绿黄相间的卡车司机帽。当德桑蒂斯和他的妻子翻转汉堡时，他们高喊口号并大声辱骂。<br><br>当特朗普最终于周六下午抵达时，他带来了一群在德桑蒂斯问题上支持他的佛罗里达州议员。 （众议员马特·盖兹（Matt Gaetz）表示，他在猪肉帐篷里烤的汉堡做得很好，但“你能做到的最好的是罗恩·德桑蒂斯”，这让人群热情高涨。）这种羞辱最终会得到回报吗？德桑蒂斯的竞选团队必须希望如此。至少在爱荷华州，佛罗里达州州长<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/us/politics/trump-iowa-poll.html">的竞选比在全国范围内更接近特朗普</a>。<br><br>当天早些时候，我采访了马特·威尔斯（Matt Wells），他是德桑蒂斯的支持者，也是来自爱荷华州华盛顿的县主席，他整个上午都在集市上跟踪这位候选人。特朗普的人民“并不真正知道自己在做什么；他们不知道自己在做什么”。 “这都是情感上的事情，”他告诉我。威尔斯曾在 2016 年为特德·克鲁兹的竞选团队工作过。他说，当时他们的地面比赛表现出色，就像德桑蒂斯现在所做的那样。 “特朗普，”威尔斯补充道，“这里没有任何地面游戏。”<br><br><a

In the 1990s, sweet drinks were all the rage. Soda sales were on what seemed like a limitless upward trajectory. Quaker bought the then-ascendant Snapple brand for $1.7 billion in cash, a sum that made me actually snort when I read it in the harsh light of 2023. Gimmicky drinks such as Surge, Orbitz, and SoBe “elixirs” crowded grocery-store shelves. As a middle schooler in the late &#39;90s, my consumption patterns were practically a case study in the era&#39;s marketing magic. I&#39;m not sure a single drop of plain water ever touched my lips outside of soccer practice.<br><br> Toward the end of that decade, the first evidence of the coming reversal was already visible. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/upshot/soda-industry-struggles-as-consumer-tastes-change.html">Skepticism</a> (most of it warranted, though some of it not) toward sugar and artificial sweeteners steadily grew. The soda giants, reading the room, began marketing their own bottled-water brands to compete with the more fashionable likes of Evian and Perrier. Dasani and Aquafina came right on time: As soda sales faltered, bottled-water sales took off. In 2016, the Beverage Marketing Corporation estimated that, for the first time, Americans<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.beveragemarketing.com/news-detail.asp?id=438">consumed more bottled water</a> —almost 40 gallons per capita on average—than carbonated beverages. Tap water, too, has found a new home in an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/the-resiliency-is-terrific-why-water-bottle-sales-are-on-fire/">ever-increasing number</a> of reusable water bottles. New <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/style/stanley-tumbler.html">Stanley cup</a> , anyone?<br><br> Americans, in short, got sold on hydration. As my colleague Katherine J. Wu <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/drinking-water-hydration-amount-importance/674926/">recently wrote</a> , how much water any particular person needs to drink to maintain a healthy baseline is still the subject of significant disagreement among experts. But in the absence of clear guidance—and with plenty of encouragement from the health-and-wellness industry—many people seem to have simply decided that more is more, and they shoot for as much as a gallon a day.<br><br> That isn&#39;t to say that everyone <em>likes</em> drinking all this water. As the nation has disciplined itself to refill its glasses, Americans have been forced to confront the inconvenient reality that drinking plain water day in and day out can be kind of a chore. To choke it all down, they&#39;ve returned to powders and concentrated syrups designed to make water more palatable, more healthful, or both. Sweet drinks are back again, albeit in a different form. Enter the <em>water enhancer</em> .<br><br> Today, products meant to gussy up your water are everywhere at grocery and convenience stores. They come in little brightly colored squeeze bottles or single-serving packets. The sales pitch is pretty simple: Throw one in your purse or laptop bag, and instead of buying a packaged beverage, you squirt a couple of drops of syrup or mix a tablespoon or two of powder into regular water. Voilà. Now water is better. This is not exactly a <em>new</em> type of product: Powdered mixes from Crystal Light and Gatorade were around in the 1980s. But unlike the water enhancers of yore, today&#39;s mixes are mostly portioned for single servings instead of big batches.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/drinking-water-hydration-amount-importance/674926/">Read: You&#39;re probably drinking enough water</a><br><br> According to Phil Lempert, a grocery-industry expert and the founder of the website Supermarket Guru, water enhancers split into roughly two categories: low-calorie flavorings, such as Kraft Heinz&#39;s highly concentrated MiO drops, and hydrating sports (or hangover) drinks, such as powdered electrolyte packets from Liquid IV Both MiO and Liquid IV debuted in the early 2010s. Within a few years, competitors including LMNT, Cure, and Buoy entered the market, along with the new entrants from old brands, Crystal Light and Gatorade among them. Most of these brands boast about their products&#39; low sugar content; even some of the enhancers flavored to taste like Skittles, Starburst, or other candy rely on artificial or alternative sweeteners and have few calories. Other ingredients have been incorporated into new products: Companies such as Cure now make caffeinated concentrates. Liquid IV has a powder that includes melatonin for sleep. Lots of other products now contain additional vitamins, minerals, or electrolytes. Many water enhancers have become, in essence, drinkable supplements.<br><br> Water enhancers&#39; rise can easily be charted in sales numbers. Darren Seifer, the food-and-beverage-industry analyst at the consumer-data firm Circana, told me that although the products are still a small part of the overall beverage market, they&#39;ve seen consistent growth. In 2022, sales volume of sports-drinks mixes—the category in which the firm places most water enhancers—was up 15 percent over the previous year. According to Seifer, the growth has been much larger for some brands. A spokesperson for Liquid IV, which was bought by Unilever in 2020, told me that the brand&#39;s sales have nearly doubled in each of the past four years.<br><br> Like so many cultural phenomena, water enhancers also have become the subject of a viral trend. WaterTok, a subset of TikTok where users mix and match different powders and syrups into recipes inside giant insulated water bottles, flooded the internet earlier this year with tips on how to make tap water taste like, among other things, birthday cake. (Like most TikTok trends, it&#39;s a little extreme, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be especially indicative of how regular people end up using the products. TikTok Franken-water sounds sort of terrifying, and some health experts <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/watertok-tiktok-water-experts-concerned-1234714010/">have expressed concern</a> over its potential misuse as a weight-loss aid.)<br><br> The whole concept of water enhancement can be pretty easy to mock: Why, exactly, can some people not find it within themselves to drink regular water? Why do they need it to taste like Skittles? Why do some people think a random wellness company might actually be able to improve on <em>water</em> , of all things? Once you&#39;ve got the water in your glass, just stop there! Drink that! And yes, drinking Jolly Rancher aspartame water does strike me as more ludicrous than just having a Diet Coke. But if you let go of your immediate revulsion at the occasional licensed candy branding and consider water enhancers as a concept on its merits, you&#39;ll find that even the worst of the bunch isn&#39;t functionally much different than a sugar-free sports drink or low-calorie lemonade. In most cases, they&#39;re arguably better if your goal is to stay hydrated, have a little treat, and have some say in how much sugar or sweetener you consume in the process.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/artificial-sweetener-aspartame-diet-coke-cancer-link-who/674586/">Read: Being alive is bad for your health</a><br><br> There&#39;s little reason to believe that the people who use water enhancers are doing so at the expense of the plain water that they&#39;d be drinking otherwise. Americans&#39; consumption of plain water remains, by all indications, robust. It&#39;s mostly sales of soda and juice that are generally sluggish, which at least hints that, for a lot of the people who like those types of drinks, the trade-off that&#39;s actually being made is between water enhancers and some kind of heavily sweetened beverage. In a lot of cases, that trade-off seems positive, on balance, especially because the enhancers allow people to control how much sweetness actually goes into a drink. This does not <em>guarantee</em> that people consume lower concentrations of flavorings, but it at least allows them to do so if they want.<br><br> To fully understand why people are suddenly so enthusiastic about water enhancers, you also have to look outside of the beverage market and to the kinds of vessels that are so often used to consume them: reusable water bottles and high-capacity insulated cups. According to Circana&#39;s data, the Hydro Flasks and Yetis and Stanleys of the world are still selling like hotcakes, and they present a significant shift in the physical reality of how a lot of Americans get their daily fluids—and, potentially, how much of those fluids they intend to be drinking. If you&#39;ve already got 30 or 40 ounces of water on your desk at work, buying a Gatorade or coconut water or other premixed beverage to lug around with it makes less sense than it otherwise would, and having a couple of packets of sweetened electrolyte powder in your laptop bag is comparatively easy.<br><br> At the core of all of this is a fundamental anxiety. Americans want to do what they can for their health, but for so many people, the most meaningful changes—easier, more affordable access to nutritious foods; taking time for exercise; less stress—are difficult to achieve or outside of their control. Swapping out sugary drinks for plausibly healthier options might not be life-altering, but at least it feels like <em>something</em> . “It&#39;s a low-hanging fruit, in terms of healthy behaviors,” Caleb Bryant, a food-and-beverage analyst at the consumer-data firm Mintel, told me. The same anxiety exists for people who buy bottled water regularly, which Circana&#39;s Seifer points out is still a huge group whose numbers have not yet shown any decline. If you&#39;re selling water enhancers, you don&#39;t need to convert bottled-water drinkers away from a product they already like, as you would with a bottled drink—you just have to convince them that they might occasionally like adding something to it.<br><br> The enhancers have their limits. The freedom they confer can easily mislead consumers about how much better self-mixed drinks actually are: The experts I spoke with all agreed that at least some people seem to assume that no matter how much or what kind of water enhancer they use, their beverage will end up inherently healthier than something prepackaged, just because they get to see the water first before they add anything to it. In that way, the brands behind water enhancers are still very much profiting off of the confusing hydration hype that&#39;s been separating people from their money in dubiously healthful ways for years.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/soda-lemon-lime-starry-sprite-pop/674857/">Read: All soda is lemon-lime soda</a><br><br> On balance, though, water enhancers do seem to offer something desirable to people who want their water to be a little bit more palatable and the companies who want to sell to them. They are, on some level, a rare win-win: Water enhancers&#39; smaller, lighter proportions have significant upsides for the companies marketing them, according to Supermarket Guru&#39;s Lempert. The beverage business as a whole is already a more profitable, less cost-intensive category in which to operate than many other sectors of the grocery industry, he told me, which likely helps account for all the upstarts flocking to the water-enhancer category—they&#39;re inexpensive to produce and don&#39;t spoil quickly. When you take away the necessity of buying plastic bottles and packing, shipping, and stocking heavy liquids, the beverage math gets even better. Consumers find some advantages in those differences too: They create less plastic waste (as long as you&#39;re not always buying bottled water to use with them), take up less room in the pantry, and are sometimes less expensive per serving than a bottled alternative.<br><br> Ultimately, the biggest driver behind water enhancers&#39; popularity is probably just the nature of water itself. It&#39;s great, but drinking a ton of it every day can become drudgery. These additive products play to a tendency to tinker with water in pursuit of health, stimulation, or pleasure that humans have had for thousands of years. Teas, coffee, beer, wine, and sweetened, fruity drinks such as aguas frescas were all developed because, on some level, water—humble and utilitarian as it is—just wasn&#39;t satisfying all of the needs and desires that our forebears had. Now that lots of people believe they need to be downing liters of water every day for their health, they&#39;ve rediscovered an age-old problem. Yes, water is great. But maybe it could be better, or at least more fun?<br><br> You <em>do</em> need to drink water; any downsides of erring on the side of overhydration don&#39;t really kick in until the volume gets extreme. But forgoing a little fun or flavor in pursuit of perfect physical health is something that humans have never been particularly good at doing. One <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.medievalists.net/2023/05/drink-water-middle-ages/">medieval religious text</a> even cited drinking nothing but plain water as a just punishment for swearing against God. With that in mind, it might have been foolish to expect that in the 21st century, with so many alternatives available, copious amounts of plain water would be the widespread drink of choice for long.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 15:24:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

50 年前关于平权行动合宪性的论证为随后有关该问题的所有法律辩论奠定了基础。<br><br>在我作为记者的五十年里，我有幸与马歇尔和托马斯谈论他们的法律哲学以及法律应如何解决种族不平等问题，我写的传记《 <a data-event-element="inline link"

个年头了。我听到马歇尔的声音在今年夏天的平权行动决定中的两种不同意见中回响，一个来自杰克逊，另一个来自最高法院唯一的拉丁裔法官索尼娅·索托马约尔。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/court-ketanji-brown-jackson-knew/627096/">琳达·格林豪斯：科坦吉·布朗·杰克逊知道的宫廷</a><br><br>杰克逊和索托马约尔在马歇尔的立场上建立了自己的观点——平权行动是一项引人注目的国家利益，对于培育一个成功的、种族多元化的社会是必要的。马歇尔<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/438/265/#F4/1">认为</a>，对少数族裔的种族优惠在法律上是允许的，因为宪法此前给予了占多数的白人优惠，同时让被奴役的黑人“被剥夺了所有合法权利”。<br><br>索托马约尔和杰克逊以 6-3 落败；最高法院的五名白人保守派人士也加入了托马斯的行列。然而，在有色人种法官中，托马斯是唯一的佼佼者，索托马约尔和杰克逊都反对他——还有马歇尔，如果他的持久存在可以投票的话。<br><br> 1978 年，在<span class="smallcaps">考虑</span>第一个平权行动案件<em>“加州大学董事会诉巴克</em>案”时，马歇尔给他的全白人同事写了一份备忘录，告诉他们不要再争论黑人取得的成就是否意味着黑人已经“到来”。 ”他引用<em>《美国新闻与世界报道》</em>列出的 83 名美国领导人的名单说，这种争论是浪费时间。他指出，“即使是潜在的亚军，也没有一个黑人”出现在名单上。<br><br>当我有一次问他关于平权行动应该帮助所有弱势学生（包括贫穷的白人）的想法时，马歇尔告诉我，“这个国家没有一个白人可以说，‘我从未因身为白人而受益。’”<br><br>马歇尔未能让他的法官同事们允许为具有学术资格的少数族裔学生保留戴维斯医学院的 16 个席位。白人多数裁定，这样做相当于种族配额，并且违宪。但马歇尔让他们同意，为了创建一个更加多元化的校园，考虑申请人的种族是合法的。<br><br>在随后对平权行动的所有挑战中，高等法院都必须与马歇尔的前提进行斗争。大法官们必须面对这样一个事实：之前允许奴隶制的宪法也根据第十四修正案的平等保护条款，为弥补最初伤害的法律措施留出了空间。<br><br>他的论点具有足够的说服力，直到今年才得以成立，当时托马斯的观点——平权行动从来不需要来修复过去的种族错误——获得了胜利。<br><br>杰克逊对托马斯反对平权行动的论点的拒绝显然激怒了这位高级黑人法官。 The depth of emotion involved for Thomas was evident in his decision to read his concurring opinion aloud in front of his fellow justices for the first time in his three decades on the bench. “根据肤色区别对待任何人都是压迫，”托马斯说。在他看来，他继续以个人的方式面对杰克逊， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_l6gn.pdf">写道</a>：“在她看来，我们都无情地陷入了一个根本上的种族主义社会，奴隶制的原罪和美国黑人的历史压迫仍然决定着我们的生活。”今天。”他后来补充道，“杰克逊法官利用她对种族之间统计关系的广泛观察以及对健康、财富和福祉的选择衡量标准，将所有黑人标记为受害者。她这样做的愿望对我来说是难以理解的。”<br><br>正如纽约大学法学教授梅丽莎·穆雷 (Melissa Murray) 对<em>《纽约时报》</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/us/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson.html">所说</a>，托马斯听起来就像“一位黑人长辈在斥责和惩罚一位犯错的青年土耳其党人，而他……未能表现出足够的尊重。就好像他期待杰克逊的种族团结一样。<br><br>托马斯似乎在让杰克逊远离马歇尔方面投入了感情。长期以来，他一直认为平权行动在学校和职业生活中使黑人蒙上了耻辱。他认为，由于平权行动，白人认为他们的黑人同龄人资质较差，甚至智力较低。<br><br> “如果我……[从事与种族相关的工作]，我的职业生涯将被无可挽回地毁掉，”托马斯在 1980 年<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/02/a-question-of-fairness/306370/">告诉我</a>，讽刺的是，他在担任平等就业机会委员会领导人之前说道。 “猴子会骑在我背上，证明我没有这份工作，因为我是黑人。第一次见到我的人会自然而然地认为我的想法是二流的。”<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/02/a-question-of-fairness/306370/">摘自1987年2月号：公平问题</a><br><br>他认为白人的屈尊俯就是对所有黑人的终生侮辱。他希望杰克逊和他一起谴责平权行动，将其视为侮辱的一部分，因为在他看来，平权行动本质上否定了黑人的平等智力和纪律。<br><br>托马斯论点最尖锐的一点是，白人对黑人的唯一义务是遵守“法律”——正如他所认为的——并确保宪法对平等权利的保护现在到位。他从未谈到过几代人在教育、就业、社会资本和增加家庭财富的机会方面的损失。他在长达 58 页的同意书中用大部分内容驳斥了这些因素，认为这些因素没有法律依据。<br><br>几年前，在接受<em>《大西洋月刊》</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/02/a-question-of-fairness/306370/">采访时</a>，托马斯向我讲述了他童年时期的一个故事，讲述了一场二十一点游戏，其中一名玩家被发现是作弊者。他说，到那时，弄清楚谁被骗了、谁合法损失了钱就毫无道理了。游戏继续进行的唯一方法是每个人都同意停止作弊——这将使其成为一个公平的竞争环境。<br><br>托马斯的论点植根于他心目中的英雄布克·T·华盛顿、马库斯·加维和马尔科姆·X 的挑衅黑人民族主义传统。在他著名的“亚特兰大妥协”演讲中，华盛顿支持黑人和白人保持社会隔离的想法，“像手指一样分开”，这样他们就可以继续做生意。当一位白人自由主义者问马尔科姆·艾克斯她能做些什么来帮助黑人进步时，他的著名回答是：“什么也做不了。”<br><br>托马斯同样认为，只有白人不妨碍黑人并停止推行平权行动等计划，黑人才能展示自己的能力。然而，托马斯和大多数黑人民族主义者之间的巨大区别在于，他向白人保证，他们对奴隶制的历史和持续的偏见不承担任何责任。<br><br>托马斯直接表达了对杰克逊的蔑视，谴责她引用黑人和白人统计上不同的结果作为“将所有黑人贴上受害者标签”的企图。他认为，她会将黑人置于“看似永久的劣等种姓”。<br><br>杰克逊并不买账。她在脚注中回应了她的异议，称是托马斯，而不是她，“表现出了对种族意识的痴迷，远远超出了我的[论点]……种族可能是影响申请人独特生活经历的一个因素。”<br><br>根据马歇尔大法官的想法，她写道，托马斯本质上被锁在种族扭曲的镜像大厅里。她说，他要求美国人不要把目光从“房间里的大象——与种族相关的差异上移开，这种差异继续阻碍我们国家充分发挥潜力”。杰克逊认为，允许大学考虑申请者的种族对于促进平等具有“普遍好处”。<br><br>至于托马斯声称平权行动导致所有黑人都被贴上受害者的标签，杰克逊表示，这种逻辑失败了，因为它“以数不胜数的方式<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/opinion/ketanji-brown-jackson-blink.html">忽视了</a>历史和现实……我们的国家从来都不是色盲的。”<br><br>索托马约尔法官与杰克逊一样，在法官席上表示托马斯的论点是错误的。 “忽视种族不会使种族不平等的社会变得平等，”她说。 “无论是 1860 年代还是 1954 年，今天都是如此：平等需要承认不平等。”<br><br>这与马歇尔多年来的论点相符。已故法官对<em>Bakke 案</em>中多数意见的部分持不同意见，即拒绝接受更广泛的平权行动观点，这将允许配额：“必须记住，在过去 200 年的大部分时间里，宪法被解释为该法院的裁决并没有禁止对黑人最巧妙和最普遍形式的歧视。现在，当国家采取行动补救歧视遗留的影响时，我无法相信同一部宪法会成为障碍。”尽管如此，马歇尔的逻辑仍然允许考虑种族因素——直到今年的决定。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">早在来到最高法院之前</span>，托马斯就主张不应将平等与融合混为一谈。<br><br>托马斯在 1987 年<em>《霍华德法律杂志》</em>上的一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/howlj30&amp;div=69&amp;id=&amp;page=">文章</a>中指出，在 1954 年<em>布朗诉教育委员会</em>一致宣布学校种族隔离为非法的判决中，法院根据课堂种族隔离所造成的社会学主张做出的裁决是错误的，正如该<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/brown-v-board-of-education#:~:text=Separate%20educational%20facilities%20are%20inherently,guaranteed%20by%20the%20Fourteenth%20Amendment.">判决</a>所指出的那样。 ，黑人学生中存在一种“自卑感”，因此“本质上是不平等的”。相反，他说，<em>布朗</em>应该转向“自由和平等的首要原则”，正如约翰·马歇尔·哈伦法官对 1896 年<em>普莱西诉弗格森</em>案判决中的异议所体现的那样。他说，对学校融合的关注导致国家陷入了数十年的“关于‘配额’、‘平权行动’以及针对社会弊病的种族意识补救措施的琐碎争论。”<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/rbc/lcrbmrp/t0e02/t0e02.pdf">写道</a>，白人“在看到我们在所有活动和成就、文化和道德宏伟方面与他们完全平等时，将被迫忘记所有种族事实和理论。”同样，伊斯兰国家领导人伊利亚·穆罕默德也曾批评马歇尔对种族融合的法律诉求是对黑人的侮辱。<br><br>当马歇尔作为一名律师在法庭上赢得了具有里程碑意义的<em>布朗</em>判决时，穆罕默德谴责他“寻求奴隶与其主人之间更密切的关系，这将导致明智的老奴隶主的孩子们对黑人的彻底毁灭” ……瑟古德·马歇尔并不关心他的同类或黑人民族的认可。他爱上了白人。他讨厌宣扬黑人民族的进步，除非得到白人的认可。”<br><br>未来的法官托马斯使用与伊斯兰国家领导人相同的逻辑，认为以马歇尔为倡导者的全国有色人种协进会应该要求法院为所有儿童提供优质教育，而不是融合。<br><br>我曾经向马歇尔大法官本人提出过托马斯的论点。我刚刚完成了<em>《华盛顿邮报》</em><em>杂志</em>对马歇尔的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1990/01/07/marshalls-law/eea56d1a-2dd6-48e3-b6de-2493e66d25d2/">简介</a>，并回访了他在法院的房间。那是 1990 年，在<em>布朗大学</em>毕业 30 多年后，大城市的学校基本上仍然是种族隔离的——这是贫困黑人学生在白人逃往郊区学校后的堡垒。<br><br>尽管如此，马歇尔告诉我托马斯错了。<br><br>马歇尔<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2004-05-16-0405140032-story.html">表示，</a>他主张学校实行种族融合，以迫使白人学校董事会、白人市长和白人州长为所有学校提供平等的服务，因为白人儿童可以在所有学校就读。他说，他并不是为了拍摄一张教室里黑人和白人孩子微笑的照片。但在他看来，让黑人孩子和白人孩子在同一间教室是确保他们拥有相同教育机会的唯一途径。<br><br>两位黑人法官从未面对面辩论过这个问题。但托马斯从未停止想要在球场上战胜他取代的那个人。在最近这场关于这个问题的争论中，在我看来，他特别想赢得杰克逊对他在辩论中的支持，向世界，特别是黑人世界表明，他是对的。他似乎渴望得到黑人的肯定，他认为白人自由主义批评者将黑人与他分开。 He once <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/499401-juan-williams-justice-thomas-seizes-his-moment-in-the-trump-era/">told</a> me that when he met with a Black student group and outlined his conservative positions to lift up Black America, the meeting ended with a young Black man telling him, “Man, they lied on you.” Thomas told me that story to show that when Black people see him for themselves, they give him the love and racial solidarity he so desperately seeks.<br><br> Not just Justice Jackson, but close to half of Black America agrees with Marshall&#39;s view that affirmative action&#39;s consideration of race was a legitimate tool for university admissions. According to a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/16/americans-and-affirmative-action-how-the-public-sees-the-consideration-of-race-in-college-admissions-hiring/">Pew Research Center poll</a> done this year, 47 percent of Black people supported the idea, 29 percent did not, and 24 percent were undecided.<br><br> Recently, Keith Ellison, Minnesota&#39;s attorney general, a Black man, suggested that Thomas was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4102079-minnesota-ag-compares-clarence-thomas-to-house-slave-in-django-unchained/">comparable</a> to a character in the 2012 movie <em>Django Unchained</em> . Samuel L. Jackson plays a house slave who remains loyal to an enslaver despite witnessing his brutal cruelty against Black people. “Clarence Thomas has decided that his best personal interest is siding with the powerful … regardless of who they are going to hurt,” Ellison said. Similarly, when the Georgia Senate voted last year to build a monument to Thomas, the state&#39;s native son, the measure was opposed by Black state senators. “It&#39;s not that we have a problem that he is a conservative or a Republican,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/hypocrite-traitor-georgia-black-lawmakers-133000692.html">said</a> State Senator Nikki Merritt, who is Black. “We think he&#39;s a hypocrite and a traitor. It seems like white America keeps wanting to promote Justice Thomas, but we see more evidence where time and time again he subverts the struggles of Black Americans.”<br><br> Thomas, who set out to defeat Marshall, has not succeeded. The power of Marshall&#39;s voice on the current Court, in the form of Jackson&#39;s and Sotomayor&#39;s dissent, showed that Thomas&#39;s views did not carry the day with Black Americans.<br><br> Though Thomas spoke from the bench, it is Marshall&#39;s voice that still resonates.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/thurgood-marshall-clarence-thomas-black-justice-scotus/674975/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/thurgood-marshall-clarence-thomas-black-justice-scotus/674975/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Problem With ‘Centering Blackness’ in Everyday Conversations]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> On good and bad color-blindness <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Qp4jKZOJ76oF_x9lo5nx8Y0DP3I=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/blackness_language_horz/original.jpg" alt="两个语音气泡，一个人在重叠空间中的轮廓" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> The hotel was soulless, like all conference hotels. I had arrived a few hours before check-in, hoping to drop off my bags before I met a friend for lunch. The employees were clearly frazzled, overwhelmed by the sudden influx of several hundred impatient academics. When I asked where I could put my luggage, the guy at the front desk simply pointed to a nearby hallway. “Wait over there with her; he&#39;s coming back.”<br><br> Who “he” was remained unclear, but I saw the woman he was referring to. She was white and about my age. She had a conference badge and a large suitcase that she was rolling back and forth in obvious exasperation. “Been waiting long?” I asked, taking up a position on the other side of the narrow hallway. “ <i>Very</i> ,” she replied. For a while, we stood in silence, minding our phones. Eventually, we began chatting.<br><br> The conversation was wide-ranging: the papers we were presenting, the bad A/V at the hotel, our favorite things to do in the city. At some point, we began talking about our jobs. She told me that— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/upshot/academic-job-crisis-phd.html">like so many academics</a> —she was juggling a temporary teaching gig while also looking for a tenure-track position.<br><br> “It&#39;s hard,” she said, “too many classes, too many students, too many papers to grade. No time for your own work. Barely any time to apply to <i>real</i> jobs.”<br><br> When I nodded sympathetically, she asked about my job and whether it was tenure-track. I admitted, a little sheepishly, that it was.<br><br> “I&#39;d love to teach at a small college like that,” she said. “I feel like none of my students wants to learn. It&#39;s exhausting.”<br><br> Then, out of nowhere, she said something that caught me completely off guard: “But I shouldn&#39;t be complaining to you about this. I know <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/10/21/scholars-talk-about-being-black-campus-2020">how hard</a> BIPOC faculty have it. You&#39;re the last person I should be whining to.”<br><br> I was taken aback, but I shouldn&#39;t have been. It was the kind of awkward comment I&#39;ve grown used to over the past few years, as “anti-racism” has become the reigning ideology of progressive political culture. Until recently, calling attention to a stranger&#39;s race in such a way would have been considered a social faux pas. That she made the remark without thinking twice—a remark, it should be noted, that assumes being a Black tenure-track professor is <i>worse</i> than being a marginally employed white one—shows how profoundly interracial social etiquette has changed since 2020&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/16/902179773/summer-of-racial-reckoning-the-match-lit">“summer of racial reckoning.”</a> That&#39;s when anti-racism—focused on combating “color-blindness” in both policy and personal conduct—grabbed ahold of the liberal mainstream.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/tyre-nichols-death-memphis-george-floyd-police-reform/672986/">Wesley Lowery: Why there was no racial reckoning</a><br><br> Though this “reckoning” brought increased public attention to the deep embeddedness of racism in supposedly color-blind American institutions, it also made instant celebrities of a number of race experts and “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) consultants who believe that being anti-racist means undergoing a<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gsb-sites.stanford.edu/anti-racism-and-allyship/">“journey”</a> of radical personal transformation. In their righteous crusade against the bad color-blindness of policies such as race-neutral college admissions, these contemporary anti-racists have also jettisoned the kind of <i>good</i> color-blindness that holds that we are more than our race, and that we should conduct our social life according to that idealized principle. Rather than balance a critique of color-blind law and policy with a continuing embrace of interpersonal color-blindness as a social etiquette, contemporary anti-racists throw the baby out with the bathwater. In place of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/actually-color-blindness-isnt-racist">the old color-blind ideal</a> , they have foisted upon well-meaning white liberals a successor social etiquette predicated on the necessity of foregrounding racial difference rather than minimizing it.<br><br> As a Black guy who grew up in a politically purple area—where being a good person meant adhering to the kind of civil-rights-era color-blindness that is now passé—I find this emergent anti-racist culture jarring. Many of my liberal friends and acquaintances now seem to believe that being a good person means constantly reminding Black people that you are aware of their Blackness. Difference, no longer to be politely ignored, is insisted upon at all times under the guise of acknowledging “positionality.” Though I am rarely made to feel excessively aware of my race when hanging out with more conservative friends or visiting my hometown, in the more liberal social circles in which I typically travel, my race is constantly invoked—“acknowledged” and “centered”—by well-intentioned anti-racist “allies.”<br><br> This “acknowledgement” tends to take one of two forms. The first is the song and dance in which white people not-so-subtly let <i>you</i> know that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/opinion/not-a-racist.html"><i>they</i> know that race and racism exist</a> . This includes finding ways to interject discussion of some (bad) news item about race or racism into casual conversation, apologizing for having problems while white (“You&#39;re the last person I should be whining to”), or inversely, offering “support” by attributing any normal human problem <i>you</i> have to racism.<br><br> The second way good white liberals often “center” racial difference in everyday interactions with minorities is by trying, always clumsily, to ensure that their “marginalized” friends and familiars are “culturally” comfortable. My favorite personal experiences of this include an acquaintance who invariably steers dinner or lunch meetups to Black-owned restaurants, and the time that a friend of a friend invited me over to go swimming in their pool before apologizing for assuming that I know how to swim (“I know that&#39;s a culturally specific thing”). It is a peculiar quirk of the 2020s&#39; racial discourse that this kind of “acknowledgement” and “centering” is viewed as progress.<br><br> My point is not that conservatives have better racial politics— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/08/07/opinion/florida-board-education-slavery-nazism/">they do not</a> —but rather that something about current progressive racial discourse has become warped and distorted. The anti-racist culture that is ascendant seems to me to have little to do with combatting structural racism or cultivating better relationships between white and Black Americans. And its rejection of color-blindness as a social ethos is not a new frontier of radical political action.<br><br> No, at the core of today&#39;s anti-racism is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/15/black-lives-matter-george-floyd-protests-policy-change/">little more than a vibe shift</a> —a soft matrix of conciliatory gestures and hip phraseology that give adherents the <i>feeling</i> that there has been a cultural change, when in fact we have merely put carpet over the rotting floorboards. Although this push to center rather than sidestep racial difference in our interpersonal relationships comes from a good place, it tends to rest on a troubling, even racist subtext: that white and Black Americans are so radically different that interracial relationships require careful management, constant eggshell-walking, and even expert guidance from professional anti-racists. Rather than producing racial harmony, this new ethos frequently has the opposite effect, making white-Black interactions stressful, unpleasant, or, perhaps most often, simply weird.<br><br> Since the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, progressive anti-racism has centered on two concepts that helped Americans make sense of his senseless death: “structural racism” and “implicit bias.” The first of these is a sociopolitical concept that highlights how certain institutions— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/12/upshot/child-maternal-mortality-rich-poor.html">maternity wards</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/16/us/minneapolis-police-george-floyd">police barracks</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/08/25/the-secret-bias-hidden-in-mortgage-approval-algorithms">lending companies</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-settlement-race-discrimination-lawsuit-against-public-housing">housing authorities</a> , etc.—produce and replicate racial inequalities, such as the disproportionate killing of Black men by the cops. The second is a psychological<i> </i>concept that describes the way that all individuals—from bleeding-heart liberals to murderers such as Derek Chauvin—harbor varying degrees of subconscious racial prejudice.<br><br> Though “structural racism” and “implicit bias” target different scales of the social order—institutions on the one hand, individuals on the other—underlying both of these ideas is a critique of so-called color-blind ideology, or what the sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva calls “color-blind racism”: the idea that policies, interactions, and rhetoric can be explicitly race-neutral but implicitly racist. As concepts, both “structural racism” and “implicit bias” rest on the presupposition that racism is an enduring feature of institutional and social life, and that so-called race neutrality is a covertly racist myth that perpetuates inequality. Some anti-racist scholars such as Uma Mazyck Jayakumar and Ibram X. Kendi have put this even more bluntly: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/supreme-court-affirmative-action-race-neutral-admissions/674565/">“&#39;Race neutral&#39; is the new “separate but equal.&#39;”</a> Yet, although anti-racist academics and activists are <i>right</i> to argue that race-neutral policies can&#39;t solve racial inequities—that supposedly color-blind laws and policies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/colorblind-constitution/602221/">are often anything but</a> —over the past few years, this line of criticism has also been bizarrely extended to color-blindness as a <i>personal</i> ethos governing behavior at the individual level.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/colorblind-constitution/602221/">Theodore R. Johnson: How conservatives turned the &#39;color-blind constitution&#39; against racial progress</a><br><br> The most famous proponent of dismantling color-blindness in everyday interactions is Robin DiAngelo, who has made an entire (very <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/dehumanizing-condescension-white-fragility/614146/">condescending</a> ) career out of asserting that if white people are not uncomfortable, anti-racism is not happening. “White comfort maintains the racial status quo, so discomfort is necessary and important,” the corporate anti-racist guru <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/white-fragility-why-it-s-so-hard-for-white-people-to-talk-about-racism-robin-diangelo/9780807047415?affiliate_id=atl-347">advises</a> . Over the past three years, this kind of anti-color-blind, pro-discomfort rhetoric has become the norm in anti-racist discourse.

The problem with color-blindness, Joseph counsels, is it allows “white people to continue to be comfortable.” The NFL analyst Emmanuel Acho wrote an entire book, simply called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/uncomfortable-conversations-with-a-black-man-emmanuel-acho/9781250800473?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man</i></a> , that admonishes readers to “stop celebrating color-blindness.” And, of course, there are endless <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/real-friends-talk-about-race-yseult-p-mukantabanahannah-summerhill?variant=40582692667426"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/real-friends-talk-about-race-bridging-the-gaps-through-uncomfortable-conversations-yseult-p-mukantabana/9780778387053?affiliate_id=atl-347">how-to guides</a> for having these “uncomfortable conversations” with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://katiecouric.com/lifestyle/relationships/how-to-talk-about-racism/">your Black friends</a> .<br><br> Once the dominant progressive ideology, professing “I don&#39;t see color” is now viewed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danabrownlee/2022/06/19/dear-white-people-when-you-say-you-dont-see-color-this-is-what-we-really-hear/?sh=b4c50c726d60">as a kind of dog whistle</a> that papers over implicit bias. Instead, current anti-racist wisdom holds that we must acknowledge racial difference in our interactions with others, rather than assume that race needn&#39;t be at the center of every interracial conversation or encounter. Coming to grips with the transition we have undergone over the past decade—color-blind etiquette&#39;s swing from de rigueur to racist—requires a longer view of an American cultural transition. Civil-rights-era color-blindness was replaced with an individualistic, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/how-to-build-an-anti-racist-company">corporatized anti-racism</a> , one focused on the purification of white psyches through racial discomfort, guilt, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/07/protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-wokeness/">“doing the work”</a> as a road to self-improvement.<br><br> Writing in 1959, the social critic Philip Rieff argued that postwar America was transforming from a religious and economic culture—one oriented around common institutions such as the church and the market—to a <i>psychological</i> culture, one oriented around the self and its emotional fulfillment. By the 1960s, Rieff had given this shift a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Therapeutic-Background-Essential-Conservative/dp/1932236805">name</a> : “the triumph of the therapeutic,” which he defined as an emergent worldview according to which the “self, improved, is the ultimate concern of modern culture.” Yet, even as he diagnosed our culture with self-obsession, Rieff also noticed something peculiar and even paradoxical. Therapeutic culture demanded that we reflect our self-actualization <i>outward</i> . Sharing our innermost selves with the world—good, bad, and ugly—became a new social mandate under the guise that authenticity and open self-expression are necessary for social cohesion.<br><br> Recent anti-racist mantras like “White silence is violence” reflect this same sentiment: exhibitionist displays of “racist” guilt are viewed as a necessary precursor to racial healing and community building. In this way, today&#39;s attacks on interpersonal color-blindness—and progressives&#39; growing fixation on implicit bias, public confession, and race-conscious social etiquette—are only the most recent manifestations of the cultural shift Rieff described. Indeed, the seeds of the current backlash against color-blindness began decades ago, with the application of a New Age, therapeutic outlook to race relations: so-called racial-sensitivity training, the forefather of today&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/antiracism-training-white-fragility-robin-diangelo-ibram-kendi.html">equally spurious</a> DEI programming.<br><br> In her 2001 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/race-experts-how-racial-etiquette-sensitivity-training-and-new-age-therapy-hijacked-the-civil-rights-revolution-elisabeth-lasch-quinn/9780742527591?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Race Experts</i></a> , the historian Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn painstakingly details how racial-sensitivity training emerged from the 1960s&#39; human-potential movement and its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/encounter-movement-a-fad-last-decade-finds-new-shape-tried-by.html">infamous “encounter groups.”</a> As she explains, what began as a more or less countercultural phenomenon was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-radical-history-of-corporate-sensitivity-training#:~:text=It%2520was%2520born%2520amid%2520the,fears%252C%2520biases%252C%2520and%2520emotions.">later corporatized</a> in the form of the anemic, pointless workshops <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/comedy-central-caves-cancel-culture-removes-episode-office-line-1623873">controversially lampooned on <i>The Office</i></a> .

Racial-awareness raising is a dynamic no longer quarantined to formalized, compulsory settings like the boardroom or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2963111">freshman orientation</a> . Instead, every interracial interaction is a potential scene of (one-way) racial edification and supplication, encounters in which good white liberals are expected to be transparent about their “positionality,” confront their “whiteness,” and—if the situation calls for it—confess their “implicit bias.”<br><br> In a vacuum, many of the prescriptions advocated by the anti-color-blind crowd are reasonable: We <i>should</i> all think more about our privileges and our place in the world. An uncomfortable conversation or an honest look in the mirror <i>can be</i> precursors to personal growth. We <i>all</i> carry around harmful, implicit biases and we <i>do</i> need to examine the subconscious assumptions and prejudices that underlie the actions we take and the things we say. My objection is not to these ideas themselves, which are sensible enough. No, my objection is that anti-racism offers little more than a Marie Kondo–ism for the white soul, promising to declutter racial baggage and clear a way to white fulfillment without doing anything meaningful to combat structural racism. As Lasch-Quinn correctly foresaw, “Casting interracial problems as issues of etiquette [puts] a premium on superficial symbols of good intentions and good motivations as well as on style and appearance rather than on the substance of change.”<br><br> Yet the problem with the therapeutics of contemporary anti-racism is not just that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Antiracism.html">they are politically sterile</a> . When anti-color-blindness and its ideology of insistent “race consciousness” are translated into the sphere of private life—to the domain of friendships, block parties, and backyard barbecues—they assault the very idea of a multiracial society, producing new forms of racism in the process. The fact that our media environment is inundated with an endless stream of books, articles, and social-media tutorials that promise to teach white people how to simply <i>interact</i> with the Black people in their life is not a sign of anti-racist progress, but of profound regression.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/dei-training-initiatives-consultants-companies-skepticism/674237/">Conor Friedersdorf: The DEI industry needs to check its privilege</a><br><br> The subtext that undergirds this new anti-racist discourse—that Black-white relationships are inherently fraught and must be navigated with the help of professionals and technical experts—testifies to the impoverishment of our interracial imagination, not to its enrichment. More gravely, anti-color-blind etiquette treats Black Americans as exotic others, permanent strangers whose racial difference is so chasmic that it must be continually managed, whose mode of humanness is so foreign that it requires white people to adopt a special set of manners and “race conscious” ritualistic practices to even have a simple conversation.<br><br> If we are going to find a way out of the racial discord that has defined American life post-Trump and post-Charlottesville and post-Floyd, we have to begin with a more sophisticated understanding of color-blindness, one that rejects the bad color-blindness on offer from the Republican Party and its partisans, as well as the <i>anti</i> -color-blindness of the anti-racist consultants. Instead, we should embrace the good color-blindness of not too long ago. At the heart of <i>that</i> color-blindness was a radical claim, one imperfectly realized but perfect as an ideal: that despite the weight of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88478467">a racist past that isn&#39;t even past</a> , we can imagine a world, or at least an interaction between two people, where racial difference doesn&#39;t make a difference.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/anti-racist-color-blindness-dei-programs/674996/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/anti-racist-color-blindness-dei-programs/674996/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Greatest Act of Greenwashing in American History]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A new chronicle of redwood logging exposes how a cadre of wealthy industrialists reaped a fortune in the name of environmentalism. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/PWfwW2bU-OoNP9ZHmqDfQDMeQVo=/0x0:2160x2700/648x810/media/img/2023/08/11/redwood/original.jpg" alt="红杉" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Delaney Allen</figcaption></figure> I <span class="smallcaps">n 1934, an industrialist</span> and obsessive book collector named A. Edward Newton <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1934/01/a-tourist-in-san-francisco/651802/">wrote an article</a> for <i>The Atlantic</i> recounting a trip he had recently taken to see the ancient redwoods of Northern California. He had traveled by night train to the timber town of Scotia, then by motor car up into the quiet, fog-draped forest. When he finally arrived, Newton did what most writers do when faced with some of the tallest trees on Earth: He experienced a wave of awe, his brain short-circuited, and then he resorted to cliché. In the article, he likens the massive trees to “stone columns in a cathedral.” Then he quotes a line of verse from William Cullen Bryant (who was cribbing, in turn, from Pliny the Elder): “The groves were God&#39;s first temples.” Very large and very old trees tend to have this effect on us—they deepen our souls but impoverish our wits. We can&#39;t quite make sense of them.<br><br> The owner of that ancient forest, the Pacific Lumber Company, had recently battled with conservationists over the right to cut down a nearby swath of old-growth redwoods called Bull Creek Flat. Newton, briefly outlining this conflict in the article, seems torn between his newfound love of the redwoods, which he now regarded as “personal friends,” and his “friends of the Pacific Lumber Company,” who had “a duty toward their stockholders.” Naturally, he was relieved that a compromise had recently been struck: A cadre of wealthy individuals, most notably John D. Rockefeller Jr., had donated millions of dollars to purchase 9,000 acres of old-growth land and fold it into an existing state park. “It was a long pull and a strong pull and a pull all together, but the thing after ten years was done,” Newton writes. “The redwoods were saved and the world is the richer therefor.”<br><br> The author was, it probably goes without saying, wrong: The old-growth redwoods were not saved, at least not in the sense that most people today would interpret that phrase. Yes, some exemplary antique redwoods were protected in museumlike groves, but elsewhere, the majority of the old-growth-redwood ecosystem was rapidly vanishing. More worrying still, it turned out that the trees were not truly protected even in “protected” areas. This fact came thundering home in the winter of 1955, when a flood washed away a clear-cut hillside above Bull Creek Flat—the very forest Newton had deemed “saved”—killing hundreds of giant trees. The notion that we could preserve a few old redwoods without also safeguarding their ecosystem was revealed to be a cruel fantasy.<br><br> As Greg King demonstrates in his groundbreaking new book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-ghost-forest-racists-radicals-and-real-estate-in-the-california-redwoods-greg-king/9781541768673?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Ghost Forest: Racists, Radicals, and Real Estate in the California Redwoods</i></a> ,<i> </i>the history of redwood conservation—and, perhaps, the history of environmentalism itself—is a never-ending series of tempting illusions and hard-won revelations. For more than a century, as loggers continued to raze entire groves that predated the birth of Christopher Columbus (and some that predated the birth of Christ), the public was continually reassured that the trees were in the process of being, or <i>had already been,</i> “saved.”<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n the mid-1980s,</span> while working as a young newspaper reporter, King stumbled across timber companies&#39; plans to cut down the nation&#39;s largest unprotected stands of old-growth redwoods. (One of those forests just happened to be a short walk from his house.) After talking with state regulators—who struck him as apathetic and ecologically misinformed—and visiting the horror show of fresh clear-cuts, he decided to quit his job, hop across the thin inky line between journalism and activism, and join the fight to save the redwoods. In the five years that followed, King climbed high into the branches of trees that were slated to be felled; he organized rallies where he was repeatedly attacked by loggers (King hit back); and, once, he was arrested for scaling the Golden Gate Bridge in order to hang a banner reading <span class="smallcaps">SAVE THIS PLANET</span> . (His friends faced even graver risks: One of his fellow organizers, Judi Bari, was the victim of both a bombing and an attempt by the FBI <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/12/duncancampbell.oliverburkeman">to frame her</a> <i>for transporting that very bomb</i> .)<br><br> If handled poorly, a history of the so-called Redwood Wars—especially when told by one of the aging activists who took part in it—could seem a bit narrow, almost quaint. (Our most urgent environmental concerns these days tend to be planetary and structural, rather than local and sylvan.) King brilliantly avoids this pitfall by expanding the scope of his book. The real story he wants to tell is an epic tale of corruption and deception, perpetrated on a mass scale for nearly a century, of which his crusade constitutes only a few chapters.<br><br> The early history of industrial redwood logging is one of outright theft: Under lax laws such as the Timber and Stone Act, which was intended to encourage new small-scale logging and mining operations, large companies routinely purchased redwood forests at steep discounts by pretending they would be used by individual homesteaders. All told, millions of acres of valuable land were stolen in this fashion.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1901/09/hunting-big-redwoods/544044/">Read: Hunting big redwoods</a><br><br> However, King adds a crucial missing piece to this oft-told history; he explains <i>why</i> that land was so valuable. Before the widespread use of steel, redwood lumber was not just any old wood. It was the very bones of industrial capitalism, at the precise moment in the 19th century when the Golden State was undergoing a growth spurt. Redwood lumber was the principal building material for entire cities, including San Francisco; it provided the most durable ties for the nascent railroad industry; and, perhaps most importantly, it could be fashioned into rot-resistant pipelines and tanks to store and transport water and petroleum. Many of these applications (especially the pipelines) required a specific type of redwood timber—the kind that could be found only in the oldest trees. But strangely, King uncovers, many of the moguls who most needed that rare lumber were the same ones who were supposedly campaigning to “save” the redwoods.<br><br> The most startling section of King&#39;s book concerns his research into the history of the venerable Save the Redwoods League—a conservation group founded in 1918 by, and for a long time largely managed by, wealthy industrialists and prominent eugenicists (the “racists” of the book&#39;s subtitle). Digging through a newly accessible archive containing the league&#39;s private documents, King reports that throughout their history, rather than attempting to preserve large tracts of wild land, as they purported to do, its early members mainly focused on buying up “beauty strips” of old-growth redwoods alongside roadways and railways, which hid the sight of the other trees being liquidated. They repeatedly brokered deals that paid logging companies exorbitant amounts of money for their land—sometimes as much as four times above the estimated market value—and on at least one occasion arrived just in the nick of time to save a lumber company from bankruptcy. Meanwhile, they actively campaigned against other conservation groups who were pushing to protect larger, more intact pieces of wilderness. In doing so, King argues, the league gave industrialists exactly what they wanted: It mollified public outcry while simultaneously guaranteeing industry&#39;s access to nature&#39;s riches. Readers familiar with Eleanor Catton&#39;s new novel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/04/birnam-wood-eleanor-catton-book-review/673668/"><i>Birnam Wood</i></a> ;<i> </i>David O. Russell&#39;s film <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO6EKe8gVXk"><i>I Heart Huckabees</i></a> ;<i> </i>or, really, any oil-industry ad campaign already know how this feat of corporate sleight of hand works. What&#39;s astonishing, in the league&#39;s case, is its duration and success. King dubs its efforts to be “the first, the largest, and the longest-lasting example” of “greenwashing” in history.<br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">f course, as an activist-historian,</span> King has learned to deftly wield illusion to his own ends as well. He elides important shifts in paradigms, such as that from classic conservationism to biocentric preservation and ecological restoration (the difference, in other words, between saving redwoods for their lumber and beauty and saving them for their own sake). He is quick to brand the league with the neat stamp of corruption, when a murkier desire for what seemed like win-win compromises was likely often at play, and he undersells its biggest accomplishments, such as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/apr/22/the-three-telegrams-rohde/">truly Herculean effort</a> to save Bull Creek Flat. The book is also markedly light on self-examination; there is scant mention of any missteps by King and his fellow North Coast activists, nor any exploration of their (by most accounts, refreshingly labor-friendly and nuanced) environmental philosophy. For a more scholarly and evenhanded account of this same history, Darren Frederick Speece&#39;s book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://uwapress.uw.edu/book/9780295745732/defending-giants/"><i>Defending Giants: The Redwood Wars and the Transformation of American Environmental Politics</i></a> , is worth reading. However, I suspect that most readers will prefer King&#39;s rendition, which, though slanted, glints with a cold, sharp light.<br><br> Near its end, the tone of the book shifts to one of bittersweet ambivalence. In 1999, in a deal brokered in part by Save the Redwoods League, which was still wielding power nearly a century after its founding, the federal government paid almost half a billion dollars to the Pacific Lumber Company in exchange for just 3,000 acres of old-growth forest, which was set aside in the newly designated <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/headwaters-opens-up-the-public-will-soon-be-2942826.php">Headwaters Forest Reserve</a> , as well as an additional 4,000 acres of previously logged land to act as a buffer. Though nominally a victory for King and his allies, the deal was a mere fraction of the 60,000 acres they felt were needed to protect the ecosystem. The combination of new federal and state regulations, court rulings, and public pressure over the past two decades has made the clear-cutting of ancient redwoods (mostly) a thing of the past. But the great dream of preservationists—a complete, protected watershed of ancient redwood giants—was never achieved, anywhere, and now never will be.<br><br> Meanwhile, climate change has begun <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.savetheredwoods.org/what-we-do/our-work/study/understanding-climate-change/">threatening</a> the old-growth redwoods, which rely on now-inconsistent amounts of fog and rain. (Ironically enough, King writes, some of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.savetheredwoods.org/blog/new-research-illuminates-climate-vulnerability-and-resilience-of-worlds-tallest-trees/">the best research</a> into the effects of climate change on the redwoods in recent years has been funded by none other than Save the Redwoods League—a last-minute grace note for an organization that he has just finished carving apart at the joints.) In the end, after reading more than 400 pages of detailed history, fierce commentary, and taut storytelling, I came away from <i>The Ghost Forest</i> oddly, but—given the book&#39;s spectral title, fittingly—mystified. Are the redwoods safe at last? Or, I wondered, are they merely apparitions, remnants of the past, soon to vanish in the new, harsh light of tomorrow?<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/redwoods-protection-conservation-history/675003/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/redwoods-protection-conservation-history/675003/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How America Got Mean]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> In a culture devoid of moral education, generations are growing up in a morally inarticulate, self-referential world. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ErwHrDisYTvej8Qd9FpdaGlQsAI=/0x157:3000x1845/1440x810/media/img/2023/07/24/0923_WEL_Brooks_MoralCollapseOpener/original.jpg" alt="镜子碎片排列成美国的形状，倒映着一棵树和天空" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">, Monday through Friday.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small><br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">ver the past</span> eight years or so, I&#39;ve been obsessed with two questions. The first is: Why have Americans become so sad? The rising rates of depression have been well publicized, as have the rising deaths of despair from drugs, alcohol, and suicide. But other statistics are similarly troubling. The percentage of people who say they don&#39;t have close friends has increased fourfold since 1990. The share of Americans ages 25 to 54 who weren&#39;t married or living with a romantic partner went up to 38 percent in 2019, from 29 percent in 1990. A record-high 25 percent of 40-year-old Americans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/28/a-record-high-share-of-40-year-olds-in-the-us-have-never-been-married/">have never married</a> . More than half of all Americans say that no one knows them well. The percentage of high-school students who report “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness” shot up from 26 percent in 2009 to 44 percent in 2021.<br><br> My second, related question is: Why have Americans become so mean? I was recently talking with a restaurant owner who said that he has to eject a customer from his restaurant for rude or cruel behavior once a week—something that never used to happen. A head nurse at a hospital told me that many on her staff are leaving the profession because patients have become so abusive. At the far extreme of meanness, hate crimes rose in 2020 to their highest level in 12 years. Murder rates have been surging, at least until recently. Same with gun sales. Social trust is plummeting. In 2000, two-thirds of American households gave to charity; in 2018, fewer than half did. The words that define our age reek of menace: <i>conspiracy</i> , <i>polarization</i> , <i>mass shootings</i> , <i>trauma</i> , <i>safe spaces</i> .<br><br> We&#39;re enmeshed in some sort of emotional, relational, and spiritual crisis, and it undergirds our political dysfunction and the general crisis of our democracy.到底是怎么回事？<br><br> Over the past few years, different social observers have offered different stories to explain the rise of hatred, anxiety, and despair.<br><br> <i>The technology story:</i> Social media is driving us all crazy.<br><br> <i>The sociology story:</i> We&#39;ve stopped participating in community organizations and are more isolated.<br><br> <i>The demography story:</i> America, long a white-dominated nation, is becoming a much more diverse country, a change that has millions of white Americans in a panic.<br><br> <i>The economy story:</i> High levels of economic inequality and insecurity have left people afraid, alienated, and pessimistic.<br><br> I agree, to an extent, with all of these stories, but I don&#39;t think any of them is the deepest one. Sure, social media has bad effects, but it is everywhere around the globe—and the mental-health crisis is not. Also, the rise of despair and hatred has engulfed a lot of people who are not on social media. Economic inequality is real, but it doesn&#39;t fully explain this level of social and emotional breakdown. The sociologists are right that we&#39;re more isolated, but why? What values lead us to choose lifestyles that make us lonely and miserable?<br><br> The most important story about why Americans have become sad and alienated and rude, I believe, is also the simplest: We inhabit a society in which people are no longer trained in how to treat others with kindness and consideration. Our society has become one in which people feel licensed to give their selfishness free rein. The story I&#39;m going to tell is about morals. In a healthy society, a web of institutions—families, schools, religious groups, community organizations, and workplaces—helps form people into kind and responsible citizens, the sort of people who show up for one another. We live in a society that&#39;s terrible at moral formation.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/pandemic-american-shoppers-nightmare/619650/">Read: American shoppers are a nightmare</a><br><br> Moral formation, as I will use that stuffy-sounding term here, comprises three things. First, helping people learn to restrain their selfishness. How do we keep our evolutionarily conferred egotism under control? Second, teaching basic social and ethical skills. How do you welcome a neighbor into your community? How do you disagree with someone constructively? And third, helping people find a purpose in life. Morally formative institutions hold up a set of ideals. They provide practical pathways toward a meaningful existence: <i>Here&#39;s how you can dedicate your life to serving the poor, or protecting the nation, or loving your neighbor.</i><br><br> For a large part of its history, America was awash in morally formative institutions. Its Founding Fathers had a low view of human nature, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-51-60">designed the Constitution to mitigate it</a> (even while validating that low view of human nature by producing a document rife with racism and sexism). “Men I find to be a Sort of Beings very badly constructed,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-37-02-0277">Benjamin Franklin wrote</a> , “as they are generally more easily provok&#39;d than reconcil&#39;d, more dispos&#39;d to do Mischief to each other than to make Reparation, and much more easily deceiv&#39;d than undeceiv&#39;d.”<br><br> If such flawed, self-centered creatures were going to govern themselves and be decent neighbors to one another, they were going to need some training. For roughly 150 years after the founding, Americans were obsessed with moral education. In 1788, Noah Webster wrote, “The <i>virtues</i> of men are of more consequence to society than their <i>abilities</i> ; and for this reason, the <i>heart</i> should be cultivated with more assiduity than the <i>head</i> .” The progressive philosopher John Dewey wrote in 1909 that schools teach morality “every moment of the day, five days a week.” Hollis Frissell, the president of the Hampton Institute, an early school for African Americans, declared, “Character is the main object of education.” As late as 1951, a commission organized by the National Education Association, one of the main teachers&#39; unions, stated that “an unremitting concern for moral and spiritual values continues to be a top priority for education.”<br><br> The moral-education programs that stippled the cultural landscape during this long stretch of history came from all points on the political and religious spectrums. School textbooks such as <i>McGuffey&#39;s Eclectic Readers</i> not only taught students how to read and write; they taught etiquette, and featured stories designed to illustrate right and wrong behavior. In the 1920s, WEB Du Bois&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2022/08/w-e-b-dubois-and-the-brownies-book/">magazine for Black children</a> , <i>The Brownies&#39; Book</i> , had a regular column called “The Judge,” which provided guidance to young readers on morals and manners. There were thriving school organizations with morally earnest names that sound quaint today—the Courtesy Club, the Thrift Club, the Knighthood of Youth.<br><br> Beyond the classroom lay a host of other groups: the YMCA; the Sunday-school movement; the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts; the settlement-house movement, which brought rich and poor together to serve the marginalized; Aldo Leopold&#39;s land ethic, which extended our moral concerns to include proper care for the natural world; professional organizations, which enforced ethical codes; unions and workplace associations, which, in addition to enhancing worker protections and paychecks, held up certain standards of working-class respectability. And of course, by the late 19th century, many Americans were members of churches or other religious communities. Mere religious faith doesn&#39;t always make people morally good, but living in a community, orienting your heart toward some transcendent love, basing your value system on concern for the underserved—those things tend to.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/kindness-happiness-negative-feedback/673862/">Arthur C. Brooks: Make yourself happy—be kind</a><br><br> An educational approach with German roots that was adopted by Scandinavian societies in the mid-to-late 19th century had a wide influence on America. It was called <i>Bildung</i> , roughly meaning “spiritual formation.” As conceived by Wilhelm von Humboldt, the <i>Bildung</i> approach gave professors complete freedom to put moral development at the center of a university&#39;s mission. In schools across Scandinavia, students studied literature and folk cultures to identify their own emotions, wounds, and weaknesses, in order to become the complex human beings that modern society required. Schools in the <i>Bildung</i> tradition also aimed to clarify the individual&#39;s responsibilities to the wider world—family, friends, nation, humanity. Start with the soul and move outward.<br><br> The <i>Bildung</i> movement helped inspire the Great Books programs that popped up at places like Columbia and the University of Chicago. They were based on the conviction that reading the major works of world literature and thinking about them deeply would provide the keys to living a richer life. Meanwhile, discipline in the small proprieties of daily existence—dressing formally, even just to go shopping or to a ball game—was considered evidence of uprightness: proof that you were a person who could be counted on when the large challenges came.<br><br> Much of American moral education drew on an ethos expressed by the headmaster of the Stowe School, in England, who wrote in 1930 that the purpose of his institution was to turn out young men who were “acceptable at a dance and invaluable in a shipwreck.” America&#39;s National Institute for Moral Instruction was founded in 1911 and published a “Children&#39;s Morality Code,” with 10 rules for right living. At the turn of the 20th century, Mount Holyoke College, an all-women&#39;s institution, was an example of an intentionally thick moral community. When a young Frances Perkins was a student there, her Latin teacher detected a certain laziness in her. She forced Perkins to spend hours conjugating Latin verbs, to cultivate self-discipline. Perkins grew to appreciate this: “For the first time I became conscious of character.” The school also called upon women to follow morally ambitious paths. “Do what nobody else wants to do; go where nobody else wants to go,” the school&#39;s founder implored. Holyoke launched women into lives of service in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. Perkins, who would become the first woman to serve in a presidential Cabinet (Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s), was galvanized there.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/students-broken-moral-compasses/492866/">Read: Students&#39; broken moral compasses</a><br><br> These various approaches to moral formation shared two premises. The first was that training the heart and body is more important than training the reasoning brain. Some moral skills can be taught the way academic subjects are imparted, through books and lectures. But we learn most virtues the way we learn crafts, through the repetition of many small habits and practices, all within a coherent moral culture—a community of common values, whose members aspire to earn one another&#39;s respect.<br><br> The other guiding premise was that concepts like justice and right and wrong are not matters of personal taste: An objective moral order exists, and human beings are creatures who habitually sin against that order. This recognition was central, for example, to the way the civil-rights movement in the 1950s and early 1960s thought about character formation. “Instead of assured progress in wisdom and decency man faces the ever present possibility of swift relapse not merely to animalism but into such calculated cruelty as no other animal can practice,” Martin Luther King Jr. believed. Elsewhere, he wrote, “The force of sinfulness is so stubborn a characteristic of human nature that it can only be restrained when the social unit is armed with both moral and physical might.”<br><br> At their best, the civil-rights marchers in this prophetic tradition understood that they could become corrupted even while serving a noble cause. They could become self-righteous because their cause was just, hardened by hatred of their opponents, prideful as they asserted power. King&#39;s strategy of nonviolence was an effort simultaneously to expose the sins of their oppressors and to restrain the sinful tendencies inherent in themselves. “What gave such widely compelling force to King&#39;s leadership and oratory,” the historian George Marsden argues, “was his bedrock conviction that moral law was built into the universe.”<br><br> A couple of obvious things need to be said about this ethos of moral formation that dominated American life for so long. It prevailed alongside all sorts of hierarchies that we now rightly find abhorrent: whites superior to Blacks, men to women, Christians to Jews, straight people to gay people. And the emphasis on morality didn&#39;t produce perfect people. Moral formation doesn&#39;t succeed in making people angels—it tries to make them better than they otherwise might be.<br><br> Furthermore, we would never want to go back to the training methods that prevailed for so long, rooted in so many <i>thou shall not</i> s and so much shaming, and riddled with so much racism and sexism. Yet a wise accounting should acknowledge that emphasizing moral formation meant focusing on an important question—what is life for?—and teaching people how to bear up under inevitable difficulties. A culture invested in shaping character helped make people resilient by giving them ideals to cling to when times got hard. In some ways, the old approach to moral formation was, at least theoretically, egalitarian: If your status in the community was based on character and reputation, then a farmer could earn dignity as readily as a banker. This ethos came down hard on self-centeredness and narcissistic display. It offered practical guidance on how to be a good neighbor, a good friend.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">And then</span> it mostly went away.<br><br> The crucial pivot happened just after World War II, as people wrestled with the horrors of the 20th century. One group, personified by the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, argued that recent events had exposed the prevalence of human depravity and the dangers, in particular, of tribalism, nationalism, and collective pride. This group wanted to double down on moral formation, with a greater emphasis on humility.<br><br> Another group, personified by Carl Rogers, a founder of humanistic psychology, focused on the problem of authority. The trouble with the 20th century, the members of this group argued, was that the existence of rigid power hierarchies led to oppression in many spheres of life. We need to liberate individuals from these authority structures, many contended. People are naturally good and can be trusted to do their own self-actualization.<br><br> After decades without much in the way of moral formation, America became a place where 74 million people looked at Donald Trump&#39;s morality and saw presidential timber.<br><br> A cluster of phenomenally successful books appeared in the decade after World War II, making the case that, as Rabbi Joshua Loth Liebman wrote in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/peace-of-mind-insights-on-human-nature-that-can-change-your-life-joshua-l-liebman/9780806514963?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Peace of Mind</i></a> (1946), “thou shalt not be afraid of thy hidden impulses.” People can trust the goodness inside. His book topped the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list for 58 weeks. Dr. Spock&#39;s first child-rearing manual was published the same year. That was followed by books like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking-10-traits-for-maximum-results-norman-vincent-peale/9780743234801?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i></a> (1952). According to this ethos, morality is not something that we develop in communities. It&#39;s nurtured by connecting with our authentic self and finding our true inner voice. If people are naturally good, we don&#39;t need moral formation; we just need to let people get in touch with themselves. Organization after organization got out of the moral-formation business and into the self-awareness business. By the mid‑1970s, for example, the Girl Scouts&#39; founding ethos of service to others had shifted: “How can you get more in touch with <i>you</i> ? What are <i>you</i> thinking? What are <i>you</i> feeling?” one Girl Scout handbook asked.<br><br> Schools began to abandon moral formation in the 1940s and &#39;50s, as the education historian B. Edward McClellan chronicles in <i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/moral-education-in-america-schools-and-the-shaping-of-character-from-colonial-times-to-the-present-b-edward-mcclellan/9780807738207?affiliate_id=atl-347">Moral Education in America</a></i> : “By the 1960s deliberate moral education was in full-scale retreat” as educators “paid more attention to the SAT scores of their students, and middle-class parents scrambled to find schools that would give their children the best chances to qualify for elite colleges and universities.” The postwar period saw similar change at the college level, Anthony Kronman, a former dean of Yale Law School, has noted. The “research ideal” supplanted the earlier humanistic ideal of cultivating the whole student. As academics grew more specialized, Kronman has argued, the big questions—What is the meaning of life? How do you live a good life?—lost all purchase. Such questions became unprofessional for an academic to even ask.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/the-benefits-of-character-education/275585/">Read: The benefits of character education</a><br><br> In sphere after sphere, people decided that moral reasoning was not really relevant. Psychology&#39;s purview grew, especially in family and educational matters, its vocabulary framing “virtually all public discussion” of the moral life of children, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/storage/app/uploads/public/58e/1a4/f58/58e1a4f58adfb826575976.pdf">James Davison Hunter, a prominent American scholar on character education, noted in 2000</a> . “For decades now, contributions from philosophers and theologians have been muted or nonexistent.” Psychology is a wonderful profession, but its goal is mental health, not moral growth.<br><br> From the start, some worried about this privatizing of morality. “If what is good, what is right, what is true is only what the individual &#39;chooses&#39; to &#39;invent,&#39; ” Walter Lippmann wrote in his 1955 collection, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-public-philosophy-walter-lippmann/9780887387913?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Essays in the Public Philosophy</i></a> , “then we are outside the traditions of civility.” His book was hooted down by establishment figures such as the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.; the de-moralization of American culture was under way.<br><br> Over the course of the 20th century, words relating to morality appeared less and less frequently in the nation&#39;s books: According to a 2012 paper, usage of a cluster of words related to being virtuous also declined significantly. Among them were <i>bravery</i> (which dropped by 65 percent), <i>gratitude</i> (58 percent), and <i>humbleness</i> (55 percent). For decades, researchers have asked incoming college students about their goals in life. In 1967, about 85 percent said they were strongly motivated to develop “a meaningful philosophy of life”; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.heri.ucla.edu/PDFs/pubs/TFS/Norms/Monographs/TheAmericanFreshman2000.pdf">by 2000, only 42 percent said that</a> . Being financially well off became the leading life goal; by 2015, 82 percent of students said wealth was their aim.<br><br> In a culture devoid of moral education, generations grow up in a morally inarticulate, self-referential world. The Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith and a team of researchers asked young adults across the country in 2008 about their moral lives. One of their findings was that the interviewees had not given the subject of morality much thought. “I&#39;ve never had to make a decision about what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong,” one young adult told the researchers. “My teachers avoid controversies like that like the plague,” many teenagers said.<br><br> The moral instincts that Smith observed in his sample fell into the pattern that the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre called “emotivism”: <i>Whatever feels good to me is moral.</i> “I would probably do what would make me happy” in any given situation <b>,</b> one of the interviewees declared. “Because it&#39;s me in the long run.” As another put it, “If you&#39;re okay with it morally, as long as you&#39;re not getting caught, then it&#39;s not really against your morals, is it?” Smith and his colleagues emphasized that the interviewees were not bad people but, because they were living “in morally very thin or spotty worlds,” they had never been given a moral vocabulary or learned moral skills.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Most of us</span> who noticed the process of de-moralization as it was occurring thought a bland moral relativism and empty consumerism would be the result: <i>You do you and I&#39;ll do me.</i> That&#39;s not what happened.<br><br> “Moral communities are fragile things, hard to build and easy to destroy,” the psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-righteous-mind-why-good-people-are-divided-by-politics-and-religion-jonathan-haidt/9780307455772?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Righteous Mind</i></a> . When you are raised in a culture without ethical structure, you become internally fragile. You have no moral compass to give you direction, no permanent ideals to which you can swear ultimate allegiance. “He who has a <i>why</i> to live for can bear with almost any <i>how</i> ,” the psychiatrist (and Holocaust survivor) Viktor Frankl wrote, interpreting a famous Nietzsche saying. Those without a <i>why</i> fall apart when the storms hit. They begin to suffer from that feeling of moral emptiness that Émile Durkheim called “anomie.”<br><br> Expecting people to build a satisfying moral and spiritual life on their own by looking within themselves is asking too much. A culture that leaves people morally naked and alone leaves them without the skills to be decent to one another. Social trust falls partly because more people are untrustworthy. That creates crowds of what psychologists call “vulnerable narcissists.” We all know grandiose narcissists—people who revere themselves as the center of the universe. Vulnerable narcissists are the more common figures in our day—people who are also addicted to thinking about themselves, but who often feel anxious, insecure, avoidant. Intensely sensitive to rejection, they scan for hints of disrespect. Their self-esteem is wildly in flux. Their uncertainty about their inner worth triggers cycles of distrust, shame, and hostility.<br><br> “The breakdown of an enduring moral framework will always produce disconnection, alienation, and an estrangement from those around you,” Luke Bretherton, a theologian at Duke Divinity School, told me. The result is the kind of sadness I see in the people around me. Young adults I know are spiraling, leaving school, moving from one mental-health facility to another. After a talk I gave in Oklahoma, a woman asked me, “What do you do when you no longer want to be alive?” The very next night I had dinner with a woman who told me that her brother had died by suicide three months before. I mentioned these events to a group of friends on a Zoom call, and nearly half of them said they&#39;d had a brush with suicide in their family. Statistics paint the broader picture: Suicide rates have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/index.html">increased by more than 30 percent</a> since 2000, according to the CDC.<br><br> Sadness, loneliness, and self-harm turn into bitterness. Social pain is ultimately a response to a sense of rejection—of being invisible, unheard, disrespected, victimized. When people feel that their identity is unrecognized, the experience registers as an injustice—because it is. People who have been treated unjustly often lash out and seek ways to humiliate those who they believe have humiliated them.<br><br> Even as our public life has grown morally bare, people yearn to feel respected and worthy of respect, need to feel that their life has some moral purpose and meaning.<br><br> Lonely eras are not just sad eras; they are violent ones. In 19th-century America, when a lot of lonely young men were crossing the western frontier, one of the things they tended to do was shoot one another. As the saying goes, pain that is not transformed gets transmitted. People grow more callous, defensive, distrustful, and hostile. The pandemic made it worse, but antisocial behavior is still high even though the lockdowns are over. And now we are caught in a cycle, ill treatment leading to humiliation and humiliation leading to more meanness. Social life becomes more barbaric, online and off.<br><br> If you put people in a moral vacuum, they will seek to fill it with the closest thing at hand. Over the past several years, people have sought to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/collapsing-levels-trust-are-devastating-america/616581/">fill the moral vacuum</a> with politics and tribalism. American society has become hyper-politicized.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/collapsing-levels-trust-are-devastating-america/616581/">David Brooks: America is having a moral convulsion</a><br><br> According to research by Ryan Streeter, the director of domestic-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, lonely young people are seven times more likely to say they are active in politics than young people who aren&#39;t lonely. For people who feel disrespected, unseen, and alone, politics is a seductive form of social therapy. It offers them a comprehensible moral landscape: The line between good and evil runs not down the middle of every human heart, but between groups. Life is a struggle between us, the forces of good, and them, the forces of evil.<br><br> The Manichaean tribalism of politics appears to give people a sense of belonging. For many years, America seemed to be awash in a culture of hyper-individualism. But these days, people are quick to identify themselves by their group: Republican, Democrat, evangelical, person of color, LGBTQ, southerner, patriot, progressive, conservative. People who feel isolated and under threat flee to totalizing identities.<br><br> Politics appears to give people a sense of righteousness: A person&#39;s moral stature is based not on their conduct, but on their location on the political spectrum. You don&#39;t have to be good; you just have to be liberal—or you just have to be conservative. The stronger a group&#39;s claim to victim status, the more virtuous it is assumed to be, and the more secure its members can feel about their own innocence.<br><br> Politics also provides an easy way to feel a sense of purpose. You don&#39;t have to feed the hungry or sit with the widow to be moral; you just have to experience the right emotion. You delude yourself that you are participating in civic life by feeling properly enraged at the other side. That righteous fury rising in your gut lets you know that you are engaged in caring about this country. The culture war is a struggle that gives life meaning.<br><br> Politics overwhelms everything. Churches, universities, sports, pop culture, health care are swept up in a succession of battles that are really just one big war—red versus blue. Evangelicalism used to be a faith; today it&#39;s primarily a political identity. College humanities departments used to study literature and history to plumb the human heart and mind; now they sometimes seem exclusively preoccupied with politics, and with the oppressive systems built around race, class, and gender. Late-night comedy shows have become political pep rallies. Hundreds of thousands of Americans died unnecessarily during the pandemic because people saw a virus through the lens of a political struggle.<br><br> This is not politics as it is normally understood. In psychically healthy societies, people fight over the politics of distribution: How high should taxes be? How much money should go to social programs for the poor and the elderly? We&#39;ve shifted focus from the politics of redistribution to the politics of recognition. Political movements are fueled by resentment, by feelings that society does not respect or recognize me. Political and media personalities gin up dramas in which our side is emotionally validated and the other side is emotionally shamed. The person practicing the politics of recognition is not trying to get resources for himself or his constituency; he is trying to admire himself. He&#39;s trying to use politics to fill the hole in his soul. It doesn&#39;t work.<br><br> The politics of recognition doesn&#39;t give you community and connection, certainly not in a system like our current one, mired in structural dysfunction. People join partisan tribes in search of belonging—but they end up in a lonely mob of isolated belligerents who merely obey the same orthodoxy.<br><br> If you are asking politics to be the reigning source of meaning in your life, you are asking more of politics than it can bear. Seeking to escape sadness, loneliness, and anomie through politics serves only to drop you into a world marked by fear and rage, by a sadistic striving for domination. Sure, you&#39;ve left the moral vacuum—but you&#39;ve landed in the pulverizing destructiveness of moral war. The politics of recognition has not produced a happy society. When asked by the General Social Survey to rate their happiness level, 20 percent of Americans in 2022 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/trends?category=Gender%20%26%20Marriage&amp;measure=happy">rated it at the lowest level</a> —only 8 percent did the same in 1990.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/">Read: What the longest study on human happiness found is the key to a good life</a><br><br> America&#39;s Founding Fathers studied the history of democracies going back to ancient Greece. They drew the lesson that democracies can be quite fragile. When private virtue fails, the constitutional order crumbles. After decades without much in the way of moral formation, America became a place where more than 74 million people looked at Donald Trump&#39;s morality and saw presidential timber.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Even in dark times,</span> sparks of renewal appear. In 2018, a documentary about Mister Rogers called <i>Won&#39;t You Be My Neighbor?</i> was released. The film showed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/what-would-mister-rogers-do/600772/">Fred Rogers in all his simple goodness</a> —his small acts of generosity; his displays of vulnerability; his respect, even reverence, for each child he encountered. People cried openly while watching it in theaters. In an age of conflict and threat, the sight of radical goodness was so moving.<br><br> In the summer of 2020, the series <i>Ted Lasso</i> premiered. When Lasso describes his goals as a soccer coach, he could mention the championships he hopes to win or some other conventional metric of success, but he says, “For me, success is not about the wins and losses. It&#39;s about helping these young fellas be the best versions of themselves on and off the field.”<br><br> That is a two-sentence description of moral formation. <i>Ted Lasso</i> is about an earnest, cheerful, and transparently kind man who enters a world that has grown cynical, amoral, and manipulative, and, episode after episode, even through his own troubles, he offers the people around him opportunities to grow more gracious, to confront their vulnerabilities and fears, and to treat one another more gently and wisely. Amid lockdowns and political rancor, it became a cultural touchstone, and the most watched show on Apple TV+.<br><br> Even as our public life has grown morally bare, people, as part of their elemental nature, yearn to feel respected and worthy of respect, need to feel that their life has some moral purpose and meaning. People still want to build a society in which it is easier to be good. So the questions before us are pretty simple: How can we build morally formative institutions that are right for the 21st century? What do we need to do to build a culture that helps people become the best versions of themselves?<br><br> Healthy moral ecologies don&#39;t just happen. They have to be seeded and tended.<br><br> A few necessities come immediately to mind.<br><br> <i>A modern vision of how to build character.</i> The old-fashioned models of character-building were hopelessly gendered. Men were supposed to display iron willpower that would help them achieve self-mastery over their unruly passions. Women were to sequester themselves in a world of ladylike gentility in order to not be corrupted by bad influences and base desires. Those formulas are obsolete today.<br><br> The best modern approach to building character is described in Iris Murdoch&#39;s book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-sovereignty-of-good-iris-murdoch/9780415854733?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Sovereignty of Good</i></a> . Murdoch writes that “nothing in life is of any value except the attempt to be virtuous.” For her, moral life is not defined merely by great deeds of courage or sacrifice in epic moments. Instead, moral life is something that goes on continually—treating people considerately in the complex situations of daily existence. For her, the essential moral act is casting a “just and loving” attention on other people.<br><br> Normally, she argues, we go about our days with self-centered, self-serving eyes. We see and judge people in ways that satisfy our own ego. We diminish and stereotype and ignore, reducing other people to bit players in our own all-consuming personal drama. But we become morally better, she continues, as we learn to see others deeply, as we learn to envelop others in the kind of patient, caring regard that makes them feel seen, heard, and understood. This is the kind of attention that implicitly asks, “What are you going through?” and cares about the answer.<br><br> I become a better person as I become more curious about those around me, as I become more skilled in seeing from their point of view. As I learn to perceive you with a patient and loving regard, I will tend to treat you well. We can, Murdoch concluded, “grow by looking.”<br><br> <i>Mandatory social-skills courses.</i> Murdoch&#39;s character-building formula roots us in the simple act of paying attention: <i>Do I attend to you well?</i> It also emphasizes that character is formed and displayed as we treat others considerately. This requires not just a good heart, but good social skills: how to listen well. How to disagree with respect. How to ask for and offer forgiveness. How to patiently cultivate a friendship. How to sit with someone who is grieving or depressed. How to be a good conversationalist.<br><br> These are some of the most important skills a person can have. And yet somehow, we don&#39;t teach them. Our schools spend years prepping students with professional skills—but offer little guidance on how to be an upstanding person in everyday life. If we&#39;re going to build a decent society, elementary schools and high schools should require students to take courses that teach these specific social skills, and thus prepare them for life with one another. We could have courses in how to be a good listener or how to build a friendship. The late feminist philosopher Nel Noddings <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://stanfordmag.org/contents/she-brought-caring-to-education-research">developed a whole pedagogy</a> around how to effectively care for others.<br><br> <i>A new core curriculum.</i> More and more colleges and universities are offering courses in what you might call “How to Live.” Yale has one called “Life Worth Living.” Notre Dame has one called “God and the Good Life.” A first-year honors program in this vein at Valparaiso University, in Indiana, involves not just conducting formal debates on ideas gleaned from the Great Books, but putting on a musical production based on their themes. Many of these courses don&#39;t give students a ready-made formula, but they introduce students to some of the venerated moral traditions—Buddhism, Judeo-Christianity, and Enlightenment rationalism, among others. They introduce students to those thinkers who have thought hard on moral problems, from Aristotle to Desmond Tutu to Martha Nussbaum. They hold up diverse exemplars to serve as models of how to live well. They put the big questions of life firmly on the table: <i>What is the ruling passion of your soul? Whom are you responsible to? What are my moral obligations? What will it take for my life to be meaningful? What does it mean to be a good human in today&#39;s world? What are the central issues we need to engage with concerning new technology and human life?</i><br><br> These questions clash with the ethos of the modern university, which is built around specialization and passing on professional or technical knowledge. But they are the most important courses a college can offer. They shouldn&#39;t be on the margins of academic life. They should be part of the required core curriculum.<br><br> <i>Intergenerational service.</i> We spend most of our lives living by the logic of the meritocracy: Life is an individual climb upward toward success. It&#39;s about pursuing self-interest.<br><br> There should be at least two periods of life when people have a chance to take a sabbatical from the meritocracy and live by an alternative logic—the logic of service: You have to give to receive. You have to lose yourself in a common cause to find yourself. The deepest human relationships are gift relationships, based on mutual care. (An obvious model for at least some aspects of this is the culture of the US military, which similarly emphasizes honor, service, selflessness, and character in support of a purpose greater than oneself, throwing together Americans of different ages and backgrounds who forge strong social bonds.)<br><br> Those sabbaticals could happen at the end of the school years and at the end of the working years. National service programs could bring younger and older people together to work to address community needs.<br><br> These programs would allow people to experience other-centered ways of being and develop practical moral habits: how to cooperate with people unlike you. How to show up day after day when progress is slow. How to do work that is generous and hard.<br><br> <i>Moral organizations.</i> Most organizations serve two sets of goals—moral goals and instrumental goals. Hospitals heal the sick and also seek to make money. Newspapers and magazines inform the public and also try to generate clicks. Law firms defend clients and also try to maximize billable hours. Nonprofits aim to serve the public good and also raise money.<br><br> In our society, the commercial or utilitarian goals tend to eclipse the moral goals. Doctors are pressured by hospital administrators to rush through patients so they can charge more fees. Journalists are incentivized to write stories that confirm reader prejudices in order to climb the most-read lists. Whole companies slip into an optimization mindset, in which everything is done to increase output and efficiency.<br><br> Moral renewal won&#39;t come until we have leaders who are explicit, loud, and credible about both sets of goals. <i>Here&#39;s how we&#39;re growing financially</i> , but also <i>Here&#39;s how we&#39;re learning to treat one another with consideration and respect; here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to forgo some financial returns in order to better serve our higher mission</i> .<br><br> Early in my career, as a TV pundit at <i>PBS NewsHour</i> , I worked with its host, Jim Lehrer. Every day, with a series of small gestures, he signaled what kind of behavior was valued there and what kind of behavior was unacceptable. In this subtle way, he established a set of norms and practices that still lives on. He and others built a thick and coherent moral ecology, and its way of being was internalized by most of the people who have worked there.<br><br> <i>Politics as a moral enterprise.</i> An ancient brand of amoralism now haunts the world. Authoritarian-style leaders like Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Xi Jinping embody a kind of amoral realism. They evince a mindset that assumes that the world is a vicious, dog-eat-dog sort of place. Life is a competition to grab what you can. Force is what matters. Morality is a luxury we cannot afford, or merely a sham that elites use to mask their own lust for power. It&#39;s fine to elect people who lie, who are corrupt, as long as they are ruthless bastards for our side. The ends justify the means.<br><br> Those of us who oppose these authoritarians stand, by contrast, for a philosophy of moral realism. Yes, of course people are selfish and life can be harsh. But over the centuries, civilizations have established rules and codes to nurture cooperation, to build trust and sweeten our condition. These include personal moral codes so we know how to treat one another well, ethical codes to help prevent corruption on the job and in public life, and the rules of the liberal world order so that nations can live in peace, secure within their borders.<br><br> Moral realists are fighting to defend and modernize these rules and standards—these sinews of civilization. Moral realism is built on certain core principles. Character is destiny. We can either elect people who try to embody the highest standards of honesty, kindness, and integrity, or elect people who shred those standards. Statecraft is soulcraft. The laws we pass shape the kinds of people we become. We can structure our tax code to encourage people to be enterprising and to save more, or we can structure the code to encourage people to be conniving and profligate. Democracy is the system that best enhances human dignity. Democratic regimes entrust power to the people, and try to form people so they will be responsible with that trust. Authoritarian regimes seek to create a world in which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.<br><br> Look, I understand why people don&#39;t want to get all moralistic in public. Many of those who do are self-righteous prigs, or rank hypocrites. And all of this is only a start. But healthy moral ecologies don&#39;t just happen. They have to be seeded and tended by people who think and talk in moral terms, who try to model and inculcate moral behavior, who understand that we have to build moral communities because on our own, we are all selfish and flawed. Moral formation is best when it&#39;s humble. It means giving people the skills and habits that will help them be considerate to others in the complex situations of life. It means helping people behave in ways that make other people feel included, seen, and respected. That&#39;s very different from how we treat people now—in ways that make them feel sad and lonely, and that make them grow unkind.<br><br> <small><i>This article appears in the</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09"><i>September 2023</i></a> <i>print edition with the headline “How America Got Mean.” When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-special-election-issue-1-abortion/674957/">上周以压倒性多数投票反对共和党和反堕胎势力推动的投票倡议，该倡议</a>旨在将州宪法未来修正案的通过门槛提高到 60%。该提案被称为“问题 1”，旨在减少选民在 11 月投票中批准一项单独动议的机会，该动议旨在推翻俄亥俄州共和党人 2019 年批准的为期六周的堕胎禁令。<br><br>俄亥俄州最大的几个县对第一期的压倒性反对延续了一种响亮的模式。自最高法院 2022 年<i>多布斯</i>判决推翻了全国宪法规定的堕胎权以来，七个州举行了投票动议，允许选民就该程序是否应保持合法进行权衡：加利福尼亚州、佛蒙特州、蒙大拿州、密歇根州、堪萨斯州、肯塔基州和现在俄亥俄州。此外，威斯康星州选民<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-2024-races/673567/">在一场围绕堕胎是否应在该州合法化的问题主导的竞选中选出了一位新的州最高法院法官。</a><br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-special-election-issue-1-abortion/674957/">阅读：堕胎的强烈反对波及俄亥俄州</a><br><br>在这八场比赛中，堕胎权立场或候选人均获胜。在每种情况下，各州最大的人口中心的大多数选民都投票支持合法堕胎——通常是以一边倒的优势。<br><br>这些惊人一致的结果突显了堕胎冲突如何放大相互关联的地理、人口和经济重组，从而重新配置美国政治。 Particularly since Donald Trump emerged as the GOP&#39;s national leader, Republicans have solidified their hold on exurban, small-town, and rural communities, whose populations tend to be predominantly white and Christian and many of whose economies are reliant<b> </b>on the powerhouse industries of the 20th century: manufacturing, energy extraction, and agriculture.反过来，民主党正在全国几乎所有最大的都市区巩固自己的优势，这些都市区往往种族更加多元化，更加世俗化，并且更加融入不断扩张的 21 世纪信息时代经济。<br><br>无党派智<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/programs/brookings-metro/">库布鲁金斯</a>学会专门向<i>《大西洋</i>月刊》提供的新数据显示，事实上，投票反对拟议堕胎限制的县是推动本州经济增长最多的地方。根据我的要求，布鲁金斯都市报利用联邦经济分析局的数据计算了在最近的五场竞选中投票支持和反对堕胎权的县在州经济总产出中所占的份额。结果令人震惊：布鲁金斯学会发现，支持堕胎权的县占密歇根州国内生产总值的五分之四以上，堪萨斯州的四分之三以上，俄亥俄州的四分之三以上，以及密歇根州的五分之三以上。肯塔基州和威斯康星州。<br><br>布鲁金斯学会高级研究员罗伯特·马克西姆告诉我：“我们不仅关注两种不同的政治制度，而且关注同一州内的两种不同经济体。”<br><br>俄亥俄州的投票再次表明，堕胎正在扩大这些不同制度之间的断层线，并对选举产生明显的影响。由于担心共和党会试图禁止堕胎，民主党在 2022 年选举中在亚利桑那州、内华达州、佐治亚州、密歇根州、宾夕法尼亚州和威斯康星州等关键摇摆州，特别是在大城市周边教育程度较高的郊区，取得了出人意料的良好表现。尽管人们对经济和乔·拜登总统的工作表现普遍不满，但民主党赢得了这些州六场州长竞选中的四场和五场美国参议院竞选中的四场。即使到 2024 年选民在这两个方面仍然不满意，民主党战略家仍持谨慎乐观态度，认为对共和党试图实施全国堕胎禁令的恐惧仍将是拜登和党内其他候选人的强大资产。<br><br>当有机会直接参与这个问题时，各种规模社区的选民都表现出了对禁止堕胎的抵制。正如<i>《华盛顿邮报》</i>的菲利普·邦普 (Philip Bump) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/09/ohio-abortion-vote-analysis/">本周计算的</a>那样，自去年以来就堕胎问题进行投票的 510 个县中，有 500 个县中支持堕胎权的选民比例超过了拜登 (佛蒙特州除外，邦普并未将佛蒙特州包括在内)在他的分析中）。<br><br>但在这些州中，大多数较小的县仍然投票反对合法堕胎，包括上周在俄亥俄州的投票。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cleveland.com/politics/2023/08/ohios-issue-1-results-how-turnout-in-urban-counties-slippage-in-rurals-cost-republicans.html">克利夫兰<i>平原经销商</i>对结果的综合分析</a>发现，在俄亥俄州的农村县，超过五分之三的选民仍然支持第一个问题。<br><br>第一个问题的反对者在该州最大的城市和郊区县以巨大的优势克服了持续的阻力。本周投票最多的 17 个县中，有 14 个县的大多数选民拒绝了第一期，其中包括投票绝对最多的所有七个县（ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/08/us/elections/results-ohio-issue-1.html?name=styln-2023-elections&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;variant=undefined">根据<i>《纽约时报》</i>公布的排名</a>）。在其中几个县，选民以 2 比 1 甚至 3 比 1 的比例反对第一个问题。<br><br>同样引人注目的是主要城市周边郊区县的结果，几乎所有这些县通常都倾向于共和党。在特朗普于 2020 年赢得的几个郊区大县（包括特拉华州和洛兰县），绝大多数人反对第一个问题。即使在共和党支持率较高、特朗普获得超过 60% 选票的郊区县（巴特勒、沃伦和克莱蒙），第一个问题上的“赞成”派也仅以微弱优势获胜。那些大城市和郊区的投票率也很高。<br><br>长期驻俄亥俄州民主党顾问杰夫·鲁斯纳克 (Jeff Rusnak) 表示，郊区的表现可能标志着该党的重要转变。他认为，俄亥俄州比该地区其他州（尤其是密歇根州、宾夕法尼亚州和威斯康星州）更加坚定地支持共和党的原因之一是，在特朗普时代，俄亥俄州女性并没有像其他州的女性那样转向民主党。 。但是，他告诉我，如果独立女性甚至倾向共和党的女性没有显着改善，第一期的“反对”一方就不可能像在郊区大县那样表现得那么好。 “我认为，在俄亥俄州，那些不一定遵循五大湖州趋势的女性现在醒悟并意识到，<i>啊哈，我们最好采取行动</i>，”鲁斯纳克说。<br><br>俄亥俄州的结果遵循了自去年最高法院裁决以来其他州举行的选举直接影响堕胎权的明显模式。在堪萨斯州，堕胎权支持者赢得了投票最多的所有六个县。在肯塔基州和密歇根州的投票中，堕胎权支持者赢得了投票最多的 10 个县中的 8 个县，而在加利福尼亚州，他们赢得了投票总数最高的 14 个县。蒙大拿州没有像其他州那样多的城市中心，但其反堕胎投票措施因投票最多的三个县的多数反对而被否决。在今年春天的威斯康星州最高法院竞选中，民主党人珍妮特·普罗塔谢维奇 (Janet Protasiewicz <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-2024-races/673567/">) 的竞选核心是异常明确地承诺支持合法堕胎</a>，她赢得了 10 个投票率最高的县中的 7 个县。 （所有这些数据均来自<i>《纽约时报》</i>对各州县的排名。）对于希望在城市和郊区社区重新站稳脚跟的共和党人来说，堕胎已经成为“一个巨大的挑战，因为他们确实站在了错误的一边”。马凯特法学院民意调查主任查尔斯·富兰克林告诉我，“这些选民的问题” <b>。</b><br><br>这些堕胎投票的结果反映了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://qz.com/13018/the-class-inversion-how-american-politics-turned-upside-down">我所说的美国政治中的“阶级倒置”</a> 。这就是现代动态，民主党<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/house-of-representatives-equity-research-institute-usc-analysis/673422/">在大城市及其周边</a>经济最活跃的地方表现最好。与此同时，共和党人更多地依赖经济陷入困境的社区，这些社区普遍抵制和怨恨主要在大城市发生的文化和人口变化。<br><br>来自北弗吉尼亚州的前共和党代表、全国共和党国会委员会主席汤姆·戴维斯（Tom Davis）向我描述了这一过程，即共和党人用“乡村俱乐部换取国家”。在一些州，用大城市郊区的利润减少换取小城镇和农村地区扩大的优势，明显改善了共和党的地位。田纳西州、肯塔基州和阿肯色州以及德克萨斯州、爱荷华州、蒙大拿州以及北卡罗来纳州等州都是如此。俄亥俄州也完全属于这一类别，共和党在蓝领选民中的支持率上升，特别是在该州东部边境沿线的县，推动该州从典型的 20 世纪末摇摆州转变为目前共和党的堡垒。<br><br>但这种重新配置同样明显伤害了其他州的共和党人，例如本世纪初的科罗拉多州和弗吉尼亚州，以及最近的亚利桑那州和佐治亚州。最大社区的实力不断增强，甚至让民主党在特朗普于 2016 年从“蓝墙”中逐出的三个关键铁锈带州中重新获得了优势：密歇根州、宾夕法尼亚州和威斯康星州。<br><br> 2022 年，民主党横扫了所有三个州的州长职位，并赢得了宾夕法尼亚州的参议院竞选。对合法堕胎的支持是所有这些胜利的核心：根据爱迪生进行的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/exit-polls">出口民意调查，</a>每个州超过五分之三的选民表示堕胎在所有或大多数情况下都应该保持合法，其中绝大多数人支持民主党候选人媒体联盟的研究。亚利桑那州的数字几乎相同，略多于五分之三的选民也支持堕胎权，其中绝大多数支持获胜的民主党州长和美国参议员候选人。<br><br>这些竞选清楚地表明，对于堕胎大多仍然合法的偏蓝或紫色州的民主党人来说，保护堕胎权是 2022 年的一个重要问题。但是， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/abortion-midterm-voters-politics-democrats-republicans-fault-lines/index.html">正如我所写</a>，事实证明，这个问题在那些禁止堕胎的更加坚定的红色倾向州中影响力要小得多：通过严格堕胎禁令的共和党州长和立法者在德克萨斯州、佐治亚州和佛罗里达州等州赢得了连任。出口民意调查发现，在那些更可靠的共和党州，即使是极少数自称支持堕胎的选民也更加重视其他问题，其中包括犯罪和移民，并支持签署堕胎限制或禁令的共和党州长。<br><br>俄亥俄州与任何州一样有力地体现了这一趋势。尽管出口民调显示近五分之三的选民表示堕胎在所有或大多数情况下都应保持合法，但共和党州长迈克·德温在签署该州为期六周的堕胎禁令后以压倒性优势赢得连任。出口民意调查发现，支持全国堕胎禁令的共和党人万斯（JD Vance）去年在俄亥俄州参议院竞选中获胜，吸引了约三分之一自称选民的选票，这些选民表示他们支持堕胎权。<br><br>俄亥俄州民主党参议员谢罗德·布朗 (Sherrod Brown) 面临 2024 年连任，他的命运可能取决于他是否能像民主党去年在密歇根州、宾夕法尼亚州和亚利桑那州等州那样赢得更多支持堕胎权的选民。 。 （同样的情况也可能发生在倾向共和党的蒙大拿州，该州的民主党参议员乔恩·泰斯特去年否决了一项反堕胎投票倡议。）<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/abortion-rights-issue-2024-election/674504/">阅读：这是堕胎，笨蛋</a><br><br>布朗有一些乐观的理由。上周第一个问题失败后，11 月份恢复该州堕胎权的后续投票倡议将使该问题继续成为焦点。反对布朗的两位主要共和党候选人都是坚定的堕胎反对者。 Secretary of State Frank LaRose, the probable front-runner in the GOP race, was the chief public advocate for last week&#39;s failed initiative.最令布朗感到鼓舞的是，该州最大的郊区县对第一个问题投的“反对”票不仅远远超过了拜登 2020 年在同一地点的表现，也远远超过了布朗在 2018 年上一次连任时的表现。<br><br>对于布朗以及明年竞争激烈的全州竞选中的几乎每一位民主党人来说，胜利之路都取决于在如此大的城市和郊区县的强劲表现。鉴于对经济的不满情绪持续存在，对拜登来说，在极少数可能决定白宫控制权的州中，在支持堕胎权的郊区选民中获得巨大优势尤为重要。本周第一期的惨败再次表明，共和党人热衷于废除合法堕胎权，已经向拜登和其他民主党人提供了最有力的论据来感动这些选民。<br><br></div>

alt="飞行的丘比特向 iPhone 射箭，屏幕破裂" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊插图。资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure> <span class="smallcaps">Growing up in Maryland</span> , Radha Patel didn&#39;t see anyone in her area using a matchmaker. But she was aware that in India, where her parents had emigrated from, plenty of couples were fixed up—by relatives, respected elders, women in the community trusted to intuit good pairs. For some reason, the idea of it stuck in the back of her mind. It was still lingering there in 2018, when friends, frustrated with dating apps, started asking for help finding love. “I&#39;m not a tech person,” she thought. “What can I do?” Then she realized that <em>she</em> could play matchmaker.<br><br> She started setting people up, and that turned into a hobby, which later that year became a business, Single to Shaadi. She and many of the matchmakers she knows saw a wave of new clients in 2020, when the popular Netflix show <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/08/netflix-indian-matchmaking-and-the-shadow-of-caste/614863/">Indian Matchmaking</a></em> , which follows a professional cupid from Mumbai, came out. The coronavirus pandemic might have contributed to the surge; especially early on, plenty of people didn&#39;t want to go on more in-person dates than absolutely necessary. And perhaps they also realized that their time was too precious to waste by swiping fruitlessly on dating apps. According to Patel, Single to Shaadi doubled its number of active clients from 2019 to 2020, and again the next year.<br><br> The field still has momentum. New matchmaking companies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/04/tired-of-swiping-left-singles-turn-to-new-matchmaking-services-.html">have</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/style/what-its-like-to-work-with-a-matchmaker.html">launched</a> in the past few years, and the matchmakers I spoke with told me they&#39;ve had an uptick in interest recently. Some dating sites have tried to take advantage of the trend, too. In 2021, Match Group, the behemoth company that owns Tinder, Hinge, and several other dating apps, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/match-introduces-a-human-matchmaking-element-to-its-dating-app-11637269774">introduced</a> a feature on Match.com through which human coaches suggest two profiles a week for each member willing to pay $4.99 weekly. And earlier this year, a spinoff show hit Netflix: <em>Jewish Matchmaking</em> .<br><br> Something about this historical tradition appears to be meshing well with contemporary society. In a time when dating apps give users an incredible amount of control over their romantic life, for some people, letting someone else take the wheel seems more and more appealing.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In societies through time</span> and across the world, people have turned to a third party to find a partner. In Jewish communities, for thousands of years, trusted figures such as scholars and rabbis acted as <em>shadkhan</em> , or matchmakers. In Japan, a <em>nakōdo</em> (“middle person”) was traditionally enlisted to present romantic candidates. Korean families historically visited a <em>jung-me</em> to ask for a pairing, and in medieval Catholic society, the village priest sometimes played a role. In all of these customs and many others, the matchmaker typically worked for the parents of an eligible young person; the families, not just the individuals, were linked. Moira Weigel, the author of <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/labor-of-love-the-invention-of-dating-moira-weigel/9780374536954?affiliate_id=atl-347">Labor of Love: The Invention of Dating</a></em> , told me that until at least the Industrial Revolution, marriage in many cultures was commonly about agriculture: uniting families to share farm labor, and to ensure a next generation that would continue that work.<br><br> But starting around the 19th century, Weigel told me, industrialization made that kind of union less necessary for many families; love became a more common ideal. And while matchmaking has remained popular in plenty of cultures, in many others, the search for romance became a more individual pursuit. People still had some informal help; friends and family members might try, welcome or unwelcome, to set singles up. But then came dating apps—an especially solitary form of courtship.<br><br> Not only can online dating be lonely—it can be extremely time-consuming. Combing through the apps can feel like a part-time job. In 2016, Hinge <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2016/10/03/why-is-the-dating-app-hinge-bashing-swipe-apps/">reported</a> that only one in 500 swipes on the app had resulted in phone numbers being exchanged. When the company surveyed 300 of its users that same year, it discovered that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thedatingapocalypse.com/stats/">81 percent of them</a> had never found a long-term relationship on any swipe-based dating app. In 2018, when the dating company Badoo <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating-apps-millenials-10-hours-per-week-tinder-bumble-romance-love-a8174006.html">surveyed</a> 5,000 18-to-30-year-olds in the UK, it found that users spent an average of 10 hours a week on dating apps.<br><br> All of that work gives daters more agency over their love life than they had in earlier eras. They don&#39;t have to wait for a serendipitous encounter, or even leave the house. At any time, they can swipe, send messages, and ask people to meet up. But that sense of control, which for many people is a blessing, can also be a burden—especially if you&#39;re talking with several suitors at once, a common situation on apps. Patel calls it “DIY dating”: All of the analysis and overthinking involved—“ <em>What&#39;s not working? What&#39;s right?</em> … <em>Am I waiting too long in between messages? Is the dude on the other end real?</em> —you have to do it all yourself.”<br><br> No wonder, then, that matchmakers are having a moment. Many people who can afford to outsource dating labor are eager to do so. Matchmaking services can be very costly: While some companies might promise a few matches for a few hundred dollars, many charge thousands, even hundreds of thousands, for a six-to-12-month-long membership, or for a handful of guaranteed dates. But they advertise a meticulous process, in which experts methodically narrow down a large pool of candidates based on clients&#39; interests, values, and assessments of past relationships. And people don&#39;t tend to use matchmakers unless they&#39;re looking for long-term commitment, so clients can feel pretty confident that they&#39;re not wasting time on confusing situationships or misrepresented intentions.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/04/couples-dating-defining-the-relationship-status-uncertainty/673650/">Read: The scariest part of a relationship</a><br><br> A matchmaker can also act as a guide throughout the very vulnerable process of dating. It might be appealing to trade in an algorithm for an intermediary who is warm, comforting, and … human. Unlike the apps, many matchmakers give advice on what to look for in a partner, how to present oneself, when to give someone another shot, even where someone might be going wrong in relationships. I heard about this when the matchmaking company Selective Search put me in touch with their client Connie Weaver, the chief marketing officer for a life-insurance company. She told me she&#39;d been married for more than three decades before her husband died in 2020. When she started dating again, in her late 60s, she didn&#39;t know what she wanted or how to go about finding it. She was a successful executive and people person, skilled at carrying a conversation in any business meeting. “But that doesn&#39;t mean, after 35 years,” she told me, “that I was good at this.” At Selective Search, “I had someone take me by the hand and give me confidence,” she said.<br><br> Weaver&#39;s second match was someone she likely wouldn&#39;t have swiped right on, had he been on an app. She hadn&#39;t wanted to date anyone in medicine—his field. (She&#39;d had bad experiences.) But she decided to have faith in the process. “You have to trust that they&#39;re going to draw out of you <em>the real you</em> ,” she told me. Four months later, Weaver&#39;s still seeing him; it&#39;s new, but it feels special. “I can&#39;t be happier,” she told me. “Everybody says that I&#39;m glowing. And I haven&#39;t glowed for a long time.”<br><br> For people floundering in the dating world, the idea that experienced chemistry professionals could pick up on qualities hidden deep within you—and use them to lead you to someone you might have missed—could be very enticing. But in order for matchmakers to do that, they&#39;d probably need to read beyond what their clients tell them. Humans don&#39;t tend to be very good at deducing what we want for ourselves, Eli Finkel, a Northwestern University psychologist who studies romantic attraction, told me. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00466-005">some</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51251730_When_and_why_do_ideal_partner_preferences_affect_the_process_of_initiating_and_maintaining_close_relationships">studies</a> , researchers have asked participants what they look for in a partner—and found that their answers don&#39;t predict the type of people whom they really go for. And people tend to be drawn to the same qualities anyway; if you&#39;re searching for someone who&#39;s, say, attractive, nice, and funny, you&#39;re not exactly unique.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/helen-fisher-science-online-dating-apps-tinder/672419/">Read: The woman who made online dating into a “science”</a><br><br> Even if matchmakers try not to take clients at their word, Finkel thinks predicting compatibility in advance is inherently an uphill battle. “A whole lot of what makes us compatible with people is <em>emergent</em> ,” he told me. “That is, it starts to exist <em>after</em> we&#39;ve met.” Even then, chemistry is complex and mysterious, and based partly on luck. He spitballed an example: Maybe one person on a date says they&#39;re from Arkansas, and the other says, <em>Oh! I went to Arkansas on this road trip, and I went to Joseph&#39;s Mother&#39;s Deli. Have you been there?</em> How well the evening goes might depend, in part, on the answer to that question, because <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em> will spin the conversation off in different directions. Perhaps both people have been there, and they compare notes, and that leads to laughter, to an inside joke, which feels like a spark.<br><br> But love&#39;s enigma is part of matchmakers&#39; allure. If you don&#39;t have the answers yourself, you can at least hope that someone else does. Weaver told me she sees matchmaking as both “an art and a science.” On the one hand, it&#39;s comforting to think that there&#39;s a compatibility code that can be cracked. On the other, we don&#39;t want romance to be too clinical, deduced purely from a couple of interviews or a detailed questionnaire. Michal Naisteter, a Philadelphia-based matchmaker and co-host of the podcast <em>The Yentas</em> , told me that that&#39;s part of why people turn to her—and, generally, to humans rather than algorithms—for help. “Some of this process is miraculous,” she told me. “It&#39;s a little cosmic.”<br><br> This is the modern approach to romance: People want efficiency, but also humanity. They want to be independent, rather than relying on family, but they still want guidance; they want options, rather than just choosing from whatever handful of suitors are in the area, but they don&#39;t want to spend hours sifting through them. Contemporary matchmaking sits at the fulcrum of humans&#39; opposing impulses when it comes to love: It tries to balance modernity and tradition, to outsource labor, and to give people an ally in a lonely dating world, without removing their autonomy.<br><br> Patel is just one of the many matchmakers trying to show customers that they can have it all. She gave her company the tagline “Not your parents&#39; matchmaker,” and she&#39;s modernized her process: She doesn&#39;t match based on caste. She makes a point to work with people of various religions, as well as different sexual and gender orientations. Single to Shaadi doesn&#39;t work with clients&#39; parents (though Patel has another matchmaking company that&#39;s more family-oriented), and Patel tries to keep her services relatively affordable—starting at just over $100—so that younger singles can pay without involving their families. It looks a little different from the matchmaking she grew up hearing about, but it&#39;s not unrecognizable. She hasn&#39;t gotten rid of the essential perk: the gift of not needing to know exactly what you want, because you&#39;re not making decisions alone.<br><br> <em><small>When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
