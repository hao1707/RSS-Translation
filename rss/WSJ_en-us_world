However, one Ukrainian official, speaking privately, confirmed the attack was a Ukrainian operation while Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, said “drones are changing the rules of the game” in the Black Sea.</p><p> The attack appears to be a Ukrainian attempt to strike at the centers of Russian grain export in the Black Sea.

Ukrainian and Western officials say the attacks are part of a Russian attempt to use food as a weapon in the war while attacking the heart of Ukraine&#39;s economy.</p><p> Ukraine uses sea drones, unmanned boats often laden with explosives, to amplify the power of its naval forces in the Black Sea. Ukraine has used the vessels in a series of attacks on key Russian sites and infrastructure. Last month, Ukrainian sea drones disabled the bridge that links Russia to the occupied Crimean Peninsula. A separate attack last year hit the headquarters of the Russian Black Sea fleet, also in Crimea.</p><p> The drones have helped Ukraine&#39;s relatively smaller naval forces resist the considerable firepower of the Russian Black Sea fleet.

That could worsen inflation at a time when output cuts by Saudi Arabia and export restrictions by Russia have already tightened global oil supplies and boosted Brent by 12% over the past month. Across two main terminals, Novorossiysk is capable of exporting about 2.5% of the 100 million barrels of oil that the world consumes daily.</p><p> The biggest portion of the oil shipped from the port comes from Kazakhstan and is produced by companies including Chevron and Exxon Mobil. About 1.5 million barrels of Kazakh crude depart each day, according to data from S&amp;P Global Commodities at Sea. Most of it leaves from a distinct terminal fed by the CPC pipeline, which is owned by a consortium including the two US oil-and-gas giants and runs from fields near the Caspian Sea to Novorossiysk.</p><p> “It&#39;s more of a scare than an impact,” said Viktor Katona, senior crude analyst at ship-tracking firm Kpler, of the Ukrainian strike. “But that scare is quite significant, because if something happens to CPC: Boy, we&#39;re in trouble.”</p><p> Most of the Russian crude and products exported from Novorossiysk now travel to Asian refiners, after the European Union and the UK <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-defies-sanctions-by-selling-oil-above-price-cap-bae1c271?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">banned most petroleum imports from Russia</a> starting last December. The Kazakh crude, though, is a vital source for refiners in Europe, particularly in the Mediterranean.</p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps
          wrap
"></div><p> If it were cut off, those refiners would have to compete for alternative supplies of light, sweet crude—or oil that is low in density and in sulfur content—which could push up prices globally.</p><p> Russia&#39;s undoing of the grain deal has imposed a de facto blockade on Ukraine&#39;s largest Black Sea ports, which were responsible for some 95% of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/great-power-rivalry-looms-over-ukraine-grain-deal-3d2e0eb1?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Ukraine&#39;s agricultural exports</a> before the war, a key link in the global food supply chain. Ukraine supplied about 9% of the world&#39;s exported wheat and nearly half the world&#39;s sunflower oil before the Russian invasion.</p><p> A senior US official said Friday that Russia had withdrawn from the grain agreement to drive up the price of its own food and fertilizer exports, which reached record levels this year. The assaults on Ukrainian ports and grain infrastructure are part of a broader Russian attack on Ukraine&#39;s economy, said James O&#39;Brien, the head of the State Department&#39;s sanctions division.</p><p> “We&#39;re witnessing Russia attacking the global food security system,” he told reporters in an online briefing.</p><p> The escalating hostilities in the Black Sea are likely to pile economic pressure on Russia&#39;s most influential international partners, including China, which was the largest buyer of grain under the export agreement. Russia&#39;s withdrawal from the deal and subsequent attacks on Ukrainian ports have also strained relations with Turkey&#39;s president, who helped broker the agreement in the first place.</p><p> Russia struck a Ukrainian port on the Danube River early on Wednesday, targeting another route that Ukraine uses to export grain, while Moscow and Kyiv have traded threats to attack ships headed to each other&#39;s ports in recent weeks. The Russian Defense Ministry said it averted an attack on ships near the port of Sevastopol in Crimea earlier this week.</p><p> By imposing a blockade on Ukraine&#39;s ports and stepping up its own Black Sea exports of grain, oil and other commodities, Russia has effectively seized control of a larger share of the vital trade routes in the waterway. Novorossiysk accounts for 17% of Russia&#39;s maritime trade.</p><p> Russia also uses the port for transporting weapons using commercial cargo ships, the Journal previously reported. A US-sanctioned Russian cargo ship, Sparta IV, was pictured in the port carrying artillery weapons in satellite imagery in July.</p><p class="articleTagLine"> —Joe Wallace and Alan Cullison contributed to this article.</p><p> Write to Thomas Grove at <a href="mailto:thomas.grove@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">thomas.grove@wsj.com</a> and Jared Malsin at <a href="mailto:jared.malsin@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">jared.malsin@wsj.com</a></p></section></div></main></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 05 Aug 2023 01:05:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-naval-drones-attack-russian-black-sea-port-81b4f2e6</guid><link/> https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-naval-drones-attack-russian-black-sea-port-81b4f2e6<author><![CDATA[Thomas GroveAnastasiia MalenkoJared Malsin]]></author><category> gfx-contrib</category><category>乌克兰</category><category>Energy</category><category> Military Watercraft</category><category> Port/Harbor Operations</category><category> Aerospace/Defense</category><category> Defense Equipment/Products</category><category> Industrial Goods</category><category>水路运输/航运</category><category>运输/物流</category><category>Capacity/Facilities</category><category>企业/行业新闻</category><category>政治/一般新闻</category><category>National/Public Security</category><category> Armed Forces</category><category> Navy</category><category> Risk News</category><category> Military Action</category><category> Commodity Markets</category><category> Energy Markets</category><category> Commodity/Financial Market News</category><category>内容类型</category><category>法激活过滤器</category><category>C&amp;E 排除过滤器</category><category>乌克兰</category><category>SYND</category><category>华尔街日报-PRO-WSJ.com</category><category> capacity</category><category> facilities</category><category>公司的</category><category>行业新闻</category><category>政治的</category><category>一般新闻</category><category>national</category><category> public security</category><category> armed forces</category><category> navy</category><category> risk news</category><category> military action</category><category> commodity markets</category><category> energy markets</category><category> commodity</category><category> financial market news</category><category>内容类型</category><category>法蒂瓦过滤器</category><category>c&amp;e 排除过滤器</category><category>energy</category><category> military watercraft</category><category> port</category><category> harbor operations</category><category> aerospace</category><category> defense</category><category> defense equipment</category><category> products</category><category> industrial goods</category><category>水运</category><category>船运</category><category>运输</category><category>后勤</category></item><item><title><![CDATA[America’s Most Tech-Forward City Has Doubts About Self-Driving Cars]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Alphabet&#39;s Waymo and General Motors&#39; Cruise are struggling to win over San Francisco residents and officials, a major hurdle in their nationwide expansion. <figure><img src="https://www.wsj.com/articles/placeholder" alt="不明确的" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption><span></span></figcaption></figure><!-- data-module-name="article.app/lib/module/wsj/breadcrumbs" --><main id="main" role="main"><div class="wsj-article-headline-wrap crawler"></div><div class="articleLead" itemprop="articleLead" data-sbid="WP-WSJ-0001109813"></div><div class="articleBody" data-sbid="WP-WSJ-0001109813"><div class="clearfix bylineWrap"><div class="byline"> By <span class="author" itemprop="name"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/meghan-bobrowsky" itemprop="url" rel="author">Meghan Bobrowsky</a></span> and <span class="author" itemprop="name"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/miles-kruppa" itemprop="url" rel="author">Miles Kruppa</a></span> | Photographs by Poppy Lynch for The Wall Street Journal</div><time class="timestamp article__timestamp flexbox__flex--1"> Aug. 4, 2023 9:00 pm ET </time></div><div subscriptions-actions="" subscriptions-display="NOT data.noSharing"><div class="share-bar"><amp-social-share type="system" width="72" height="24" data-param-url="https://www.wsj.com/articles/americas-most-tech-forward-city-has-doubts-about-self-driving-cars-d6b098e0"></amp-social-share></div></div><section subscriptions-section="content"><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"></div><p> SAN FRANCISCO—This city&#39;s inhabitants embraced computers, the Internet and cellphones before the rest of the world caught on. They are not so sure about self-driving cars.</p><p> Suddenly, orange and white driverless Cruise and Waymo cars seem to be everywhere. Some first responders say they get in the way, and pedestrians fill social media with reports of the cars&#39; antics. They have collided with at least two pets. An anti-car activist group placed orange traffic cones on the hoods of the vehicles, freezing them in place while creating viral videos of the stunt.</p><p> San Francisco&#39;s reaction is a preview of the challenges Cruise, majority owned by GM, and Waymo, part of Google parent <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GOOG" class="">Alphabet</a> <span class="company-name-type">,</span> will face as they expand to cities across the US Both companies have invested billions in driverless cars, hoping they will become massive businesses, and they still need to win hearts and minds.</p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"></div><p> A city of about 800,000 people, San Francisco has already played host to thousands of self-driving car test miles, and some residents are regular users. Now the companies want to offer ride-hailing businesses that can compete with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/LYFT" class="company-name">Lyft</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/UBER" class="">Uber</a> <span class="company-name-type">.</span></p><p> If the companies get their wishes, San Francisco will become ground zero for one of the first big urban experiments in transportation using autonomous vehicles.

The vote has been delayed twice, and the agency will hold a hearing next week to hear responses from the companies to a list of safety concerns.</p><p> “We think that autonomous vehicles are amazing and we believe that someday they will be safer than human drivers,” said Jeffrey Tumlin, director of transportation for San Francisco&#39;s transit authority. “So far, the industry has not demonstrated that.”</p><p> Cruise and Waymo are fighting back.

Cruise has quintupled the number of cars it has on San Francisco roads since the beginning of the year, Vogt said. Most of its almost 400 vehicles nationwide are in the tech hub.</p><p> “Anything new, especially a technology that comes across as borderline magic, is going to have a lot of questions and create a lot of attention,” Vogt said. “Attention draws controversy.”</p><p> Waymo asked riders to write letters to state officials last month. The company might not be able to continue operating in San Francisco, it said, if the state voted “no.”</p><p> Cruise took out full-page ads in several newspapers stating, “Humans are terrible drivers,” citing nearly 43,000 crash fatalities from car accidents in the US last year.</p><p> For now, Cruise is offering paid rides at night in San Francisco. Waymo doesn&#39;t have the state&#39;s permission to offer paid rides yet, but people can ride in its cars free of charge. Both have waiting lists to get on the apps.</p><p> The group behind the traffic cones, Safe Street Rebel, coordinated the stunt as a weeklong protest of Cruise and Waymo&#39;s expansion ahead of the state commission vote. Members trolled the streets wearing gloves and facial coverings, searching for cars in areas where they are frequently spotted such as the streets around the Panhandle park. The cones confused the cars sensors, some of which are placed on their roofs, stopping them in place.</p><p> After the state commission moved back its vote, the activists claimed partial credit for the delay and applauded state officials for applying more scrutiny to the expansion plans.</p><p> Cruise and Waymo have burned through billions of dollars in their attempts to build on-demand taxi services, which they hope will eventually produce greater profits without the need for human drivers. So far, their businesses have produced minimal revenue. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Tumlin, the transportation director, said officials need more publicly available data from the self-driving car companies to draw conclusions about their safety, and the city is making progress toward that goal.</p><p> Cruise and Waymo both said their cars haven&#39;t caused any traffic fatalities. In their first million miles driven, Waymo said its self-driving vehicles in fully autonomous mode didn&#39;t cause any collisions with human drivers.</p><p> A Cruise spokesman said it just takes one ride to convert a skeptic to a believer. About 90% of people who have taken a ride are willing to ride in one a second time, he said, citing internal data.</p><p> Sebastian Thrun, who previously led the Google Self-Driving Car Project that is now known as Waymo, said people would start to see the benefits if the cars were allowed to operate more widely.

A Cruise spokesman declined to comment on the specific case.</p><p> Vogt criticized the city for promoting what he called misleading data. Cruise has spoken with city officials more than 50 times over the past year to hear their concerns and has made changes to the service based on the feedback, he said.</p><p> Waymo-Co-CEO Mawakana pushed back on the idea that residents are opposed to the vehicles, citing the 100,000-plus people who have signed up for the waiting list to access Waymo&#39;s taxi service.</p><p> “I have people pinging, emailing and complaining every day about how long they&#39;ve been waiting to get into the service,” Mawakana said.</p><p> Maya Waldman, who works in education, signed up to be an unpaid test rider for Waymo during an earlier stage in San Francisco and has ridden more than 5,000 miles in the cars.</p><p> Waldman, who said she didn&#39;t know much about self-driving cars before the program, now feels safer in them than in traditional ride-hailing services. Among other things, she&#39;s not at the mercy of a random assortment of human drivers.</p><p> “Every time I hail a Waymo, it&#39;s the same driver,” she said. “When I get into a Lyft or Uber, which I do still use sometimes, I never know what I&#39;m going to get.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

It has also extended the scope of its law on the protection of minors to include cyberspace, and has shut down or reprimanded thousands of apps and websites that officials said were found harmful to children.</p><p> In China, the internet penetration rate in people ages 6 to 18 was 97% in 2021, compared with 73% in all age groups, according to the state-backed China Internet Network Information Center.</p><p> Minors&#39; physical and mental health continue to be jeopardized by exposure to cyber scams, bullying, violence, pornography and advertising, as well as addiction to videogames, Niu Yibing, deputy director of the CAC, said in March while laying out the agency&#39;s priorities for the year.</p><p> “The big idea here is to give parents a very convenient one-button choice to turn on a child mode on their phones,” Tom Nunlist, a Shanghai-based associate director at Trivium China who specializes in tech policy, said of the CAC&#39;s draft guidance.</p><p> In addition to the time limits, the proposed regulation also spells out types of content recommended for children of different age groups, and details what content they should be actively shielded from. Children less than three years of age, for example, should mainly be limited to audio content, according to the draft, while apps should promote core socialist values and help minors develop good habits.</p><p> Apps shouldn&#39;t use algorithms to recommend content that could encourage children to imitate unsafe behaviors and induce them to become addicted to the internet, according to the draft.</p><p> Chinese video-sharing apps and social-media platforms have been required since 2019 to deploy anti-addiction systems for teenagers that restrict screen time and access to certain types of content. TikTok&#39;s Chinese sibling app, Douyin, automatically activates a “teenager mode” that limits daily usage to 40 minutes for users under the age of 14, though parents can give consent to turn it off.</p><p> Douyin rival Kuaishou said it has refined its moderation policies and added additional layers to filter content for younger users. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/TCEHY" class="company-name">Tencent Holdings</a> &#39; do-everything app WeChat restricts minors from accessing some features such as livestreaming, shopping and videogames.

At the same time, he aimed to weaken the group with military strikes. Military analysts say that strategy so hobbled the insurgency that it agreed to peace, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ceremony-marks-colombian-rebels-disarmament-1498600940?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">disarming thousands of fighters</a> and dismantling units steeped in trafficking cocaine to the US</p><p> Petro has broken with that policy by proposing to rebel groups and cocaine-smuggling groups, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-colombian-rebels-once-ruled-drug-gangs-now-fight-for-control-1531733400?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">such as the vicious Gulf Clan</a> , that it would roll back military operations in exchange for negotiations. His peace team has been feverishly working to get negotiations started with the goal of reaching accords as fast as possible, say government officials.</p><p> In past efforts “negotiations have always been limited to one armed group, with the other groups left at the sidelines,” said Danilo Rueda, the government&#39;s high commissioner for peace. “And that has led other groups to expand territorially.”</p><p> Rueda said the government wants to achieve peace in the three years left in Petro&#39;s term.</p><p> “That&#39;s the goal, to do it in this government, to show the country that talks, based on respect for life, will lead to the conditions for peace,” said Rueda. “These talks have as a starting point that you cannot torture, disappear people, or kill,” he said. The government&#39;s plans, though, have faced serious challenges.</p><p> Petro lifted the cease-fire with the Gulf Clan in March, after accusing the group of widespread violence. The army has now deployed thousands of troops against the group in northern Colombia, where it is centered. The group remains robust, Colombian government officials say, even though some of its top leaders have in recent years <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/suspected-colombian-drug-kingpin-extradited-to-u-s-11651787114?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">been killed or extradited to the US</a> in operations in which American intelligence was essential.</p><p> After the government accused another group made up of former FARC fighters, the so-called Central Staff, of killing four indigenous children, Petro ended the cease-fire in four provinces.

Efforts to advance peace talks in the past have failed, the latest in 2019 when the government accused the group of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/colombian-rebel-group-claims-responsibility-for-police-academy-attack-11548098014?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">detonating a bomb at a policy academy</a> , killing 22 cadets.</p><p> Even now, with the cease-fire, the group&#39;s leaders haven&#39;t agreed to end the activities that fund the ELN, including kidnapping, extortion and drug trafficking.</p><p> “The organization cannot debilitate itself strategically,” an ELN commander participating in negotiations, Víctor Orlando Cubides, told reporters Thursday. “The financial activities continue.”</p><p> Frank Pearl, a negotiator in talks with the FARC in the Santos government, said that by implementing a cease-fire now, the government is giving the ELN a chance to strengthen its forces even as it is in talks, since it won&#39;t be under military pressure.</p><p> And holding simultaneous talks with several armed groups is extremely challenging, Pearl said, because the two sides have to agree on complex issues that can normally take years. They include how to deliver justice to war-crime victims, how to disarm thousands of fighters, what economic benefits former rebels should receive, and what concessions should be made to guerrilla commanders to give up the fight.</p><p> “Doing it all at once makes it more complex,” Pearl said. “The advantage is if it works, you can achieve it and have peace quickly. The downside is if it doesn&#39;t, you can lead to some groups having grown stronger in some regions.”</p><p> The cease-fire was accompanied Thursday by a gathering at Bogotá&#39;s convention center of leaders from indigenous communities and farmers from rural areas where the ELN has operated. The rebel group and government have agreed to forums for ordinary Colombians—running parallel to the peace negotiations with the government—in which they can propose economic and political changes they want to see in Colombia. </p><div class="media-object scope-

To anxious French and American allies, he repeated assurances that the army would soon rescue him from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/niger-coup-embassy-evacuation-africa-33d18bc?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">an unfolding coup</a> .</p><p> Outside the ground floor safe room Mohamed Bazoum had recently renovated to protect himself from such an event, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/niger-general-declares-himself-leader-as-russian-mercenary-hails-coup-d47efa68?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">mutineers from his presidential guard</a> fanned out across the presidency compound, furious about a proposal to replace their longstanding commander, according to Nigerien, US and European officials. Hunkered over the phone beside his wife and son, Bazoum delicately encouraged advisers to send the army&#39;s regular units.</p><p> At around noon, his cellphone rang with a call from a former US ambassador, who was about to board a flight on his vacation. The ambassador was worried one of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/niger-coup-upends-u-s-security-plans-in-west-africa-handing-russia-an-opportunity-8dcf6679?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Washington&#39;s closest allies in Africa</a> could become the latest in a string of regional states to fall into the hands of coup leaders sympathetic to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/france-prepares-to-evacuate-european-citizens-from-coup-hit-niger-d46774af?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Russia</a> .</p><p> Everything is fine, the imprisoned president carefully intoned.</p><p> A week later, Bazoum is still imprisoned in his palace, junta leaders are seeking aid from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> &#39;s regional partners and America is on the verge of losing its most important ally in a crucial and unstable part of Africa. An obscure personnel dispute within Niger&#39;s presidential guard has now become what appears to be a geopolitical win for Russia and its Wagner Group paramilitary company in their bid to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-need-of-allies-putin-courts-african-leaders-in-st-petersburg-b6596a7b?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">flip Western allies</a> .</p><p> The situation could yet turn into open military conflict. Eleven West African countries, led by Nigeria, have threatened to use force to restore Bazoum to power if the coup isn&#39;t reversed by Sunday. In return, the pro-Russian leaders of Mali and Burkina Faso have vowed to defend Niger. Officials in the US and Europe are scrambling for ways to return Bazoum to power but concede the window is closing.</p><p> The Kremlin on Friday warned against any intervention. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Wagner&#39;s mercenaries have previously taken over former US and French outposts in Syria and Mali.</p><p> This outcome wasn&#39;t predestined. A week of missteps and communication breakdowns pushed the vast nation of Niger toward Russia. Nigerien, American, European and other West African security officials, as well as Nigerien soldiers, described a series of unexpected blunders that now threatens to turn West Africa into a theater for regional war.</p><p> Washington, caught without key personnel in its Africa posts, failed to anticipate what is now the seventh coup in the region since 2020—not including a failed attempt in Niger two years ago. While Bazoum sat in his safe room calling for help, America and its allies struggled to react as the conflict escalated into threats of war between Russian-backed countries and West Africa&#39;s biggest military, Nigeria. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Yet the country&#39;s special forces, trained for nearly every counterterrorism eventuality, had no answer for Sunday&#39;s coup—West Africa&#39;s most enduring security threat. The forces were left chatting over WhatsApp groups over whether to intervene.</p><p> The US and Europe have made Niger the centerpiece of their fight against the spread of Islamic State and al Qaeda in Africa&#39;s Sahel, a 3,000-mile semiarid territory on the southern shore of the Sahara that also includes Burkina Faso, Mali and Chad. They are some of the world&#39;s poorest and fastest-growing populations, in failing states. Nearly half of Niger&#39;s budget comes from foreign aid.</p><p> “This is your strong ally, your reliable ally, you have invested a lot and then there is a coup without any reason,” said Kiari Liman Tinguiri, Niger&#39;s ambassador to Washington, who was fired by the junta overnight. “It&#39;s very nice to be friends of the West, but it may not be helpful when hard times come.”</p><p> US State and White House officials have said they still think there&#39;s a narrow opportunity for a peaceful resolution that would retain Niger&#39;s democracy.</p><p> “While we are giving diplomacy a chance and have ongoing diplomatic engagements at the highest levels, we are continuing to review all options around our cooperation with the Nigerien government,” a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council said. “Our focus is to help the people of Niger preserve their hard-earned democracy.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

Humanitarian and food assistance will continue.</p><h3> Saharan citadel</h3><p> The coup began with an idea for a personnel change, mulled over months by Bazoum and his aides, to replace the leader of the presidential guard that held watch over the country&#39;s 63-year-old commander-in-chief.</p><p> US and French intelligence officers had long known about the president&#39;s plan to reshuffle his security detail and the risks it entailed. The presidential guard felt marginalized after vast sums of military assistance poured into the country&#39;s counterterrorism units, two people familiar with the situation said.</p><p> The French intelligence service DGSE warned Paris of the risk, but neither France nor the US took significant action to defend their ally in Niamey, according to French and West African intelligence officials.</p><p> Bazoum, elected in 2021 in Niger&#39;s first democratic transfer of power, had been feted in Washington as a reliable partner against the twin threats of jihadist attacks and Russia&#39;s growing influence. </p><div class="media-object scope-

He rattled off gender-inequality statistics at events hosted by the State Department and the Gates Foundation, and regaled audiences with his efforts to educate girls in a country whose birthrate is the world&#39;s highest, at seven children for every woman.</p><p> After coup leaders in neighboring Mali and Burkina Faso shifted toward Russia, Bazoum made clear he stood with America.</p><p> Niger registered just 114 attacks from jihadist groups last year, while Burkina Faso and Mali combined registered some 2,000, according to data collected by the nonprofit Armed Conflict Location &amp; Event Data Project and analyzed by the Pentagon-funded Africa Center for Strategic Studies.</p><p> “More bases? We don&#39;t need them,” he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal shortly after he was elected.</p><p> Some of Niger&#39;s military leaders saw him as an interloper with an Arab background. Niger&#39;s majority Hausa ethnic group predominates the military.</p><p> In April, Bazoum replaced the army chief of staff and the head of the national gendarmerie, hoping to place more trusted officers in their ranks, according to European and West African security officials. That stirred suspicion within his presidential guard. On July 24, Bazoum directed an aide to draft a decree to dismiss the guard&#39;s leader. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Omar Tchiani had protected Niger&#39;s leaders for 12 years, with a unit of some 700 elite soldiers backed by armored cars. Tchiani&#39;s unit had stopped a coup attempt against Bazoum days ahead of his inauguration. As Bazoum built up the country&#39;s counterterrorism forces, Tchiani&#39;s guard lost out on resources and stature. The president had been weighing for months whether to fire the 57-year-old general, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p> At 3 am on July 26, the general&#39;s men drove up to the presidential palace, a white stucco arabesque estate overlooking the Niger River. Inside, gazelles and goats slept in the manicured gardens, animals Bazoum and his wife brought with them when he took office.</p><p> Tchiani&#39;s men, carrying heavy weaponry, disarmed security officers equipped only with handguns and walked past the presidential garden to Bazoum&#39;s residence.</p><p> Bazoum fled into the safe room across the hall from his office and phoned aides to say he was confident that US-trained elements of his army would rally to his rescue.</p><p> In a twist, some of the best US-trained special forces among Niger&#39;s regular army units were on counterterrorism missions in the distant desert regions of a country twice the size of Texas, with few roads. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Rank-and-file soldiers said they debated over WhatsApp groups what to do. They received no formal instructions from their commanders, who appeared to be waiting to see which faction had the momentum. Bazoum, who still had full control of his communications in the safe room, phoned international allies and ambassadors in Niger&#39;s embassies in the West. He stressed over phone and video calls that the coup had no basis—it was a personnel dispute and could easily be reversed. His US envoy rushed to let the State Department know what was happening.</p><p> Though the US had spent hundreds of millions of dollars transforming Niger into its top military outpost in the Sahara, it didn&#39;t have an ambassador in the country.</p><p> The Biden administration didn&#39;t formally nominate one until eight months after the previous ambassador left, only to face opposition from Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.), who has put <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-woke-complaints-hold-up-bidens-ambassador-picks-b95e73e9?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">holds on State Department appointees</a> until the White House releases intelligence he believes could show Covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab.</p><p> Washington also has no ambassador at the African Union or in neighboring Nigeria—or anybody in a special envoy post that it had created to deal with the region&#39;s deterioration. The relevant Africa desk at the National Security Council was in flux, held by a short-term temporary post that was due to hand off to another temporary caretaker within days.</p><p> “This is extremely frustrating. This was not a widely supported coup—it was one unit that had its grievance for years and we should have done more to act,” said J. Peter Pham, former US special envoy to the Sahel under President Trump. In the early hours, he added, “his exfiltration could have been organized relatively easily…. The golden hour has passed.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

A decision would have to come from President Emmanuel Macron, who was traveling in the South Pacific, 12 time zones ahead. France&#39;s government declined to comment.</p><p> Junta leaders headed to a state TV station and stood around a table where a stone-faced spokesman said the military could no longer “witness the gradual and inevitable demise of our country.”</p><p> If Bazoum was going to be freed, it would have to come from outside.</p><h3> Guns of August</h3><p> Macron had just landed in the South Pacific island of New Caledonia when he spoke to his top defense and diplomatic officials, who laid out options to free Bazoum.</p><p> For years, the French president had been briefed on a growing protest movement against France in the cities of its former West African colonies.</p><p> Young men jam-packed into those cities had come to see France&#39;s military presence as an unwelcome imposition after years of al Qaeda attacks. Viral social-media posts and videos accused the French army of pursuing ulterior aims on Africa&#39;s natural resources.</p><p> In Mali, then Burkina Faso, coup leaders seized power and justified their takeovers as an act of liberation from France, before turning to Russia as their protector and benefactor.</p><p> The French president ruled out sending a unilateral force to usher a democratically elected president to power—as France did in 2011 in Ivory Coast. Instead, he wanted to assist Nigerien armed forces that remained loyal to Bazoum, an option that vanished as the country&#39;s military command acquiesced to the coup.</p><p> US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in the South Pacific as well, warning the people of the island country of Tonga that China was practicing economic coercion. By the time he and Bazoum connected, the coup was complete.</p><p> Russia was in an excellent position to step into the vacuum.</p><p> Vladimir Putin was already receiving African leaders invited to a Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg due to start the following day.</p><p> Bazoum had refused the invitation, but the Kremlin-backed leaders of Mali and Burkina Faso, Assimi Goita and Ibrahim Traore, gathered for meetings in the halls of the Constantine Palace.

But now, we have an opportunity to form new relations.”</p><p> The junta, which included recipients of US training and largess, hadn&#39;t shown particular interest in pivoting toward Russia. The military itself let US counterparts know they wanted to keep the American aid flowing, military officers said. But the Kremlin eyed an opportunity.</p><p> Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/putin-moves-to-seize-control-of-wagners-global-empire-26d49286?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Wagner mercenaries</a> are protecting the leaders of Mali and the Central African Republic, offered to help the putschists in Niger, hailing their overthrow of a pro-American government.</p><p> “What happened in Niger is nothing other than the struggle of the people of Niger with their colonizers,” he said in a voice-mail message posted in a Telegram account.</p><p> Protests, organized by an opposition movement, thronged France&#39;s embassy in Niger. Several in the crowd waved Russian flags. France sent military planes to evacuate its citizens. The US moved its 1,100 troops, sent there to fight Islamist insurgents, inside American-built drone and special-forces bases. The State Department held off on calling the upheaval a coup, a designation that could, under US law, sharply restrict America&#39;s ability to keep funding, training and equipping Niger&#39;s military. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Its leaders feared a domino of coups would topple more civilian governments.</p><p> On Sunday, July 30, Nigeria&#39;s new president, Bola Tinubu, gathered with presidents and foreign ministers from 11 West African states, along with a representative from Bazoum&#39;s government, in a glass-paneled building in the Nigerian capital of Abuja. Tinubu, who had risen to prominence campaigning against military rule in Nigeria, said that after coups in Mali and Burkina Faso—both supported by Russia—as well as in Guinea and Chad, the one in Niger was the last straw. If they accepted this coup, more would come.</p><p> After their meeting ended, the West African leaders issued an ultimatum: Tchiani had one week to return power to the democratically elected president or face the possible use of military force.</p><p> The State Department wasn&#39;t sure it backed the idea, senior US officials said. But Washington also wanted to show support for the West African governments. Blinken issued statements of general support for the Nigerian-led idea. A Nigerian government spokesperson declined to comment.</p><p> On Wednesday, Tchiani sent one of his junta leaders on a secret flight to Mali to meet the country&#39;s pro-Russian leader.</p><p> Defense chiefs from the West African states that oppose the coup met in Nigeria. Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer flew to Abuja to meet Tinubu, Nigeria&#39;s president, who said the coup should not stand.</p><p> The Biden administration favored diplomacy but worried the junta intended to force Nigeria to make good on its threat of military force, concerns that came up in the meeting. Few in Washington felt confident Nigeria&#39;s military had the capacity to pull off an intervention. But at this point, the US conceded, there were few options left. </p><div class="media-object scope-

"></div><p> Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this year that the Kremlin isn&#39;t paying attention to Navalny&#39;s case, and refrains from getting involved in matters of the court. When asked to comment on Navalny, Putin has typically avoided even voicing the critic&#39;s name.</p><p> Before his <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-returns-to-moscow-11610906483?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">arrest at a Moscow airport in 2021</a> , Navalny had developed a large online following for his exposure of corruption, including investigations into Putin&#39;s personal wealth. From prison, he has continued to lampoon government policies, condemn the war in Ukraine and urged Russians to speak out.</p><p> Navalny&#39;s aides say prison authorities have gone out of their way to make his life intolerable by regularly placing him in what is called a punishment cell where prisoners are denied food parcels or the opportunity to buy additional food, leaving them relying solely on food and water supplied by the prison. He has also complained of being forced to share a prison cell with unsanitary inmates who neglect personal hygiene.</p><p> In addition, concern has grown over Navalny&#39;s health, which had already been damaged by what medical experts in Germany, France and Sweden concluded was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-novichok-poisoning-of-alexei-navalny-some-see-a-kremlin-calling-card-11599157248?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">a poisoning attempt in 2020</a> . His aides say he has lost a lot of weight and has suffered from stomach pain and seizures, leading them to believe that he&#39;s being slowly poisoned in the Melekhovo prison near Moscow.</p><p> Prison authorities didn&#39;t respond to a request for comment on the poisoning claims or that he is being unjustly placed in solitary confinement.</p><p> The additional prison terms, human-rights activists say, are aimed at trying to break him.</p><p> So far, there is little sign of that working. Shown on video in the courtroom on Friday, Navalny appeared relaxed, shaking hands and chatting with his co-defendant Daniel Kholodny, a former technical director of Navalny&#39;s YouTube channel, who is accused of financing extremist activities using his official position and participation in an extremist community. Kholodny received an eight-year sentence, TASS reported. </p><div class="media-object scope-
