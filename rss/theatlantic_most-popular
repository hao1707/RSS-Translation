Cause]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>数百万人因文书工作而失去医疗补助。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/dw8U1D_lP295VdJL4tkqGi4IRYs=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/medicaid/original.jpg" alt="折断翅膀的阿斯克勒庇俄斯之杖" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>乔安妮·因佩里奥/《大西洋月刊》插图。资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure>目前，美国各地的父母都面临着一个可能的噩梦：带着生病的孩子去看医生，却在前台被告知他们的健康保险不再有效。原因是数以百万计的低收入美国家庭失去了医疗补助福利，因为他们必须跳过意想不到的行政障碍，从而导致一场缓慢燃烧的危机。<br><br>这个问题源于大流行时代要求各州为每个人维持持续医疗补助覆盖的规则的结束。医疗补助资格主要取决于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.medicaid.gov/medicaid/eligibility/index.html">收入</a>，通常需要定期验证。现在各州已停止提供连续覆盖。但这需要在短短 6 到 14 个月内重新确定<em>所有</em>参与者的资格，这意味着覆盖有时因住房不稳定而频繁流动的人口，并且自 2020 年以来无需处理验证流程。<br><br>结果已经是灾难性的。截至 8 月 3 日，跟踪可用州名册的凯撒家庭基金会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/medicaid-enrollment-and-unwinding-tracker/">显示，</a>近 400 万人失去了医疗补助覆盖范围。随着验证检查的进行，这一数字将继续上升；政府专家估计最终数字<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/03/us/politics/medicaid-enrollment-pandemic.html">可能高达1500万</a>。在目前按年龄分类的八个州中，失去医疗保健的人中有近三分之一是儿童。这<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ccf.georgetown.edu/2023/07/19/the-medicaid-unwinds-impact-on-children-are-they-moving-to-chip/">尤其令人担忧</a>，但也不足为奇：许多孩子都有资格通过父母的医疗补助或<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.medicaid.gov/chip/index.html">相关的儿童特定计划</a>获得资格。因此，大约一半的美国儿童受到其中一项计划的覆盖。<br><br>如果每个失去医疗补助的人实际上都不再符合资格——也许他们在连续承保开始后找到了一份高薪工作——这种退出现象就不那么引人注目了。然而，在报告数据的各州的所有退出者中，74% 的人因“程序原因”而被退出。凯撒家庭基金会将这些情况定义为人们根本没有完成医疗补助续签文件的情况，可能是因为该州没有他们当前的联系信息，或者他们错过了截止日期。<br><br>许多退出的人可能仍然有资格获得保险：凯撒家庭基金会最近对医疗补助受益人进行的一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/poll-finding/the-unwinding-of-medicaid-continuous-enrollment-knowledge-and-experiences-of-enrollees/">调查</a>发现，只有 10% 的人表示他们的变化使他们没有资格获得保险，但另外四分之一的人表示他们不确定。在某些情况下，尽管勾选了所有正确的行政方框，个人还是失去了保险： <em>《</em><em>德克萨斯论坛报》</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/28/texas-medicaid-children-disabled/">报道称</a>，德克萨斯州卫生与公众服务委员会的未具名员工写的一封信声称，近 80,000 名符合条件的德克萨斯人“错误地失去了保险”。 （德克萨斯州 HHSC 没有向<em>论坛报</em>确认这个数字。）由于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/08/01/medicaid-coverage-losses-arkansas/">IT 故障</a>或人为错误，其他地方也发生了同样的情况。<br><br>对人类造成的后果是严重的，而且可能会变得更糟。父母无力承担<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://missouriindependent.com/2023/07/27/kids-make-up-half-of-missourians-who-lost-medicaid-in-first-month-of-reviews/">子女所需的医疗费用</a>；癌症治疗、手术和其他手术有被<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wvxu.org/2023-05-22/many-people-that-were-on-medicaid-are-finding-themselves-uninsured">延误的</a>风险。这场溃败暴露了政府官僚主义最糟糕的一面。正如<em>《大西洋月刊</em>》的安妮·劳瑞 (Annie Lowrey) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/how-government-learned-waste-your-time-tax/619568/">所写</a>，“问题不在于现代生活会带来文书工作的麻烦。问题在于，美国的福利计划总体来说对于普通公民来说很难甚至有时是不可能的。”在这种情况下，许多资金<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/01/politics/medicaid-termination-states/index.html">不足的</a>县和州医疗补助办公室的<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/how-government-learned-waste-your-time-tax/619568/">阅读：时间税</a><br><br>大规模退出也反映了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/06/13/medicaid-insurance-coverage-arkansas-00101744">党派优先事项</a>或缺乏优先事项：共和党<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.penncapital-star.com/blog/citing-medicaid-costs-gop-governors-call-for-an-end-to-pandemic-public-health-emergency/">敦促匆忙结束连续覆盖</a>，而且多年来双方都系统性地缺乏医疗补助基础设施的资金。尽管社区团体<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/black-churches-work-to-blunt-the-impact-of-medicaid-unwinding-on-their-communities">正在尽最大努力</a>接触受影响的家庭，但政策制定者的反应却参差不齐。负责监督医疗补助的联邦卫生与公众服务部为各州提供了一些额外的灵活性，并要求十几个州暂时<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/politics/medicaid-disenrollments-pause-cms/index.html">暂停参保计划</a>以解决各种问题。除此之外，该部门没有<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://rollcall.com/2023/06/28/hhs-has-limited-options-as-millions-lose-medicaid/">采取任何行动</a>迫使各州大幅放慢或改变取消入学的进程，国会也没有提出任何实质性的立法修改。<br><br>这里的风险很高：简单地未能更新个人地址或电话号码，或者国家机构未能正确处理表格，就会导致数百万人失去可获得的医疗保健服务。可以说，当前对于低收入家庭及其子女的福祉来说，没有什么比这更紧迫的政策问题了。然而，这整个情况似乎是可以预见和避免的。<br><br></div>

将糖果变成了华盛顿特区市中心的一场活动。制造出来的奇思妙想：一切都在那里。一些路过的人注视着这一幕，脸上露出好奇、困惑和怜悯的表情。有些人耸耸肩，加入了队伍。<br><br>我是耸肩派中的一员。 （我偶然发现了一辆，嗯，芥末移动车——一辆经过改造的大众货车——我的好奇心战胜了我。）在我等待的过程中，队伍在我身后越来越长，绕着一个广阔的城市广场转了一圈，旁观者拍了照片和视频， “芥末彩虹糖！”的回复偶尔会打破市中心的喧嚣。<br><br>这次活动是一个经典的营销噱头，包括与调味糖果一起分发的品牌腰包和飞盘。但谁在活动中做广告——穿着黄色 T 恤、精力充沛的工作人员，还是排队的人？还有……为什么？彩虹糖是一长串伪零食中的最新产品，其中包括牧场酱味冰淇淋、Velveeta 味马提尼酒和几种法国特有的融合食品，其根源在于震撼价值就像性一样具有吸引力。它们是充当奇观的食品，而 TikTok 的趋势正在等待：在它们中，化学家的能力与影响者文化的需求发生了碰撞。它们是营销人员不断努力将付费媒体和免费媒体转变为同一事物所产生的可食用效果。作为食物，它们的味道一般来说是令人厌恶的。<br><br>不过，新彩虹糖最显着的事实并不是它们尝起来像芥末。事实上，它们根本不是为了被品尝的。通过它们，Skittles 品牌将“限量版”产品的吸引力推向了荒谬的新极端：生产出来的少量包装对于普通消费者来说几乎不可能获得。 （如果你不是住在华盛顿特区附近，或者纽约市或亚特兰大附近，其他两个地方都有芥末手机的访问，那么你获得包裹的唯一机会就是在在线抽奖中赢得一个。 ）<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/papa-johns-reviewed/544988/">阅读：棒约翰，评论</a><br><br>那么，看，薛定谔的糖果。新的彩虹糖是不适合食用的食物和不适合出售的产品。他们的营销方式完全是后现代的：叙事，一路向下。它们在会议室中构思并在实验室中炮制而成，它们的实际存在几乎与它们的真正目的背道而驰：成为社交媒体和广播节目的辩论；成为一个病毒式传播的想法；为Skittles这个品牌赋予了相关的光泽涂层。糖果的口味可能是新的；但在其他方面，它们都是平庸的。在它们的空虚中，它们象征着营销中以及消费者与被消费者之间的关系中正在发生的范式转变。<br><br>最早的广告都是实际事务，其中大多数都非常真诚，几乎所有广告都隐含着理性。他们通过证明其收益值得其成本来销售商品。然而，随着时间的推移，愿望的诱惑开始显现：营销不仅是满足消费者的欲望，而且是创造新的欲望。严格来说，芥末味的彩虹糖不参与这两种类型的努力。他们并不是试图推销自己（事实上，没有什么可买的），也不是试图激发潜在顾客对糖果的渴望。相反，他们正在做一些更符合社交媒体时代的事情：他们不再将消费者视为潜在客户，而是视为潜在的广告商。当线条足够长时，线条就会自我认可。当有那么多人在等待某样东西时，逻辑假设是，所讨论的东西一定是值得等待的——即使所讨论的东西是一袋有趣的芥末味糖果。这个过程在网上比在现场更加真实。在数字空间中，兴趣会产生兴趣。趋势催生趋势。很快，如果火星公司如愿的话，芥末彩虹糖将无处不在，尽管它们无处可去。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/08/the-rise-of-the-micro-holiday/375487/">阅读：微假期的兴起</a><br><br>站在吃喝玩乐的队伍里，我不确定自己是在听笑话还是在开玩笑，这让我想起了艾达·路易丝·赫克斯泰布尔<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/30/arts/living-with-the-fake-and-liking-it.html">1997 年发表的一篇文章</a>，内容是关于人工行为悄悄渗入美国公民空间的。这位建筑评论家特别考虑了拉斯维加斯：赫克斯特布尔认为，在这个地方，“真实与虚假之间不再存在或被认为没有必要进行区分”。在一个兜售无处可归的地方，世界奇观曾经——而且仍然——被净化成奇观。它们成为令人惊叹和谈论的事物。他们优先考虑制造的现实，而不是可以用感官体验的版本：也就是说，实际上是真实的版本。<br><br>我们的数字架构正在发生类似的转变，因为它们变得越来越脱离物理环境的事实。反过来，这种转变正在改变讽刺与真诚、粉丝与消费主义、广告世界与整个世界之间的假定交易。在成长的过程中，我习惯于以一种近乎怀疑的怀疑态度对待广告：广告是一种操纵，这个想法是这样的，精明的消费者也这样看待它们。然而，在社交媒体时代——这个把人当作品牌的时代，把现实让给那些将现实编成最引人入胜的故事的人——旧有的谨慎也正在消失。消费的定义正在发生变化。 （例如，参见<em>《芭比娃娃》</em>电影，它模糊了消费品的讽刺和消费品广告之间的界限，然后又被消除了。）<br><br>在这种背景下，芥末味彩虹糖的荒谬就完全有道理了。这些糖果是美国文化战争辩论中欢快、蜡笔色调的附属品：它们很容易谈论。它们会引起本能反应。您可能想知道彩虹糖的味道如何，并且：它们尝起来像芥末。与任何彩虹糖一样，口感先于味道，因为外壳让位于咀嚼。你会尝到一点辣根的味道，咸味而辛辣，接着是一阵熟悉的黄芥末味，接着是一阵令人腻味的甜味。具有讽刺意味的是，最终的效果让我想起了品味。<br><br>这并不是一种恭维：我不喜欢我的芥末彩虹糖体验的任何方面。但享受不是重点。甚至，实际上，体验本身也不是。吃零食可能会令人愉悦且充满活力。但从本质上讲，它是一种孤独的经历。吃东西——品尝它、消费它、用它作为食物——对于“克”来说是很难做到的。不过，谈论零食吗？将它们变成图像、视频、故事和标签？这样才能赢得点赞。这可以货币化。这可以服务于每个品牌。<br><br></div>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>马克电源/万能</figcaption></figure>1964年，<span class="smallcaps">当林登·B·约翰逊总统</span>宣布“向贫困无条件宣战”时，国家没有任何计算贫困人口的方法，甚至没有一个关于如何定义贫困的坚定概念。他的政府急忙想出一项衡量进展的措施。后来决定，该指标将是一个三口或三口以上的家庭维持餐桌上食物所需的最低收入乘以三（当时，食物占典型家庭预算的三分之一）。<br><br>收入是幸福感的重要指标之一，但它并不是唯一的指标：健康状况和社会流动性等因素也很重要。这就是为什么我们应该把关注点从贫困转向弱势。<i>劣势</i>是一个比<i>贫困</i>更有用的术语，因为我们不仅仅是在谈论收入，我们还试图捕捉一个人的生活机会受到多种环境阻碍的复杂性。<i>劣势</i>更准确，因为它意味着不公正。人们受到了不公平的阻碍。<br><br>劣势不能仅在个人或家庭层面上理解。得益于社会科学研究，我们现在知道，儿童的生活机会不仅受到他们的背景（不仅是收入和家庭环境，而且还受到他们的社区）的深刻影响，而不是他们的基因特征或他们所接受的医疗护理。<br><br>考虑到这一点，我们创建了所谓的深度弱势指数，它反映了两种传统的收入衡量标准（贫困率和“深度贫困率”，即收入低于贫困线一半的人），这是健康的两个标志（出生体重和预期寿命），以及在低收入家庭长大的儿童的社会流动率。我们使用该指数对美国大约 3,100 个县以及人口最多的 500 个城市进行了排名。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/06/how-to-end-extreme-child-poverty/618720/">摘自 2021 年 6 月号：消除极端贫困的简单方法</a><br><br>排名立即显示出明显的地理格局。第一个惊喜是，我们的指数中最弱势的地区主要是农村地区，尤其是对于那些一生研究城市贫困的教授来说。但它们并不符合美国乡村的刻板印象。尽管其中一些人以白人为主，但大多数人以黑人或西班牙裔为主。我们还可以看到，许多拥有大量美洲原住民人口的地方属于全国最弱势的地区。芝加哥、洛杉矶和纽约存在相当程度的贫困。但在我们的同类比较中，这些城市都没有跻身全国 600 个最贫困地区之列。该名单上唯一的城市是克利夫兰、底特律和罗切斯特等少数工业城市。<br><br>有人可能会说我们应该考虑到许多城市的高生活成本，但这比看起来更复杂。尽管在某些地方人们支付的住房费用更高，但他们也受益于良好的医疗保健系统、更慷慨的安全网、公共交通和更高质量的学校。生活在我们指数中 200 个最贫困地区的人们与生活在美国 500 个最大城市的人们一样，在支付住房费用方面可能遇到很大困难。<br><br>我们的指数确定的 200 个最弱势地区集中在三个地区：阿巴拉契亚、德克萨斯州南部和南部棉花带。 （除了那些拥有大量美洲原住民社区的县之外，没有一个西部县出现在名单上。）这些地方都有着密集的资源开采和人类剥削的历史，而这种程度在美国其他地方是不存在的。这种经济模式在每个地方都在 19 世纪末或 20 世纪初出现（或者说，就棉花带而言，完全繁荣）。在每个地方，都有一个行业主导经济，这种模式一直持续到 20 世纪 60 年代，当时棉花大王、烟草大王、煤炭大王和德克萨斯州南部的农业都屈服于自动化和全球竞争的双重力量。<br><br>如果我们非常迟钝或固执，就会忽略这样一个事实：这些地方类似于殖民地——美国境内的内部殖民地。使用<i>国家中的国家</i>或<i>殖民地</i>等术语来描述美国境内对有色人种社区的剥削美国在黑人学者和活动家中有着悠久的历史。在走访美国许多最贫困的地区时，我们开始通过历史研究、民族志观察和深入访谈来开展这项工作。<br><br>在阿巴拉契亚中部，我们开车穿过公司城镇的遗迹，许多城镇只有一两条街宽，还有山谷——在群山之间绵延数英里的狭窄山谷。我们来到肯塔基州克莱县，在内战之前这里是强大的盐业大亨和自给农场的所在地。内战后，大木材公司和大煤炭公司接手。如今，阿片类药物危机正在该地区肆虐。县城曼彻斯特的当地人哀叹电影院（现在是五旬节教堂）的衰落和保龄球馆的消失。众多的酒吧、咖啡馆和美容院；还有一个因高速公路建设项目而被铲平的公园。人们将阿片类药物使用的增加归咎于现在“除了毒品别无他法”。<br><br>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/skillsmap/">成人文盲率</a>仍然是全国最高的。<br><br>当我们到达典型的棉花带小镇的郊区时，田野被一排闪闪发光的白色战前房屋所取代，里面有大草坪、古老的树木和宏伟的入口，入口处有两三层楼高的柱子。这些地方表面上看起来很平静，但例如在密西西比州的勒弗洛尔县，黑人居民告诉我们，暴力是他们面临的第一个问题。那里的人际暴力死亡率几乎是全国平均水平的四倍，远高于芝加哥所在地伊利诺伊州库克县的死亡率。我们很快就会了解到，勒弗洛尔县及其所代表的更大地区——从卡罗莱纳州延伸到阿肯色州东部和路易斯安那州的广阔棉花带——确实是全国最危险的地区之一。<b> </b>这些地方有着悠久的暴力传统，并得到政府的接受和支持。几代人以来，它都是白人精英用来压迫美国黑人劳工的最有力工具。<br><br>在这些地区，我们看到相同的主题一次又一次出现——不平等的教育、社会基础设施的崩溃、暴力、根深蒂固的公共腐败以及政府计划中嵌入的结构性种族主义。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">探索深度劣势指数的另一</span>端——被确定为最大优势的地方——对我们的研究也至关重要。我们再一次对指数的走向感到惊讶。这里不是曼哈顿，也不是科技发达的西雅图。相反，该列表将我们指向中西部北部：明尼苏达州、达科他州、威斯康星州、内布拉斯加州和爱荷华州。总体而言，这些地方的贫困率非常低，婴儿出生时健康，人们活到耄耋之年，低收入儿童通常有与其他孩子相似的进入中产阶级的机会。<br><br>最具优势的县最初是拥有中等规模农场的农业社区，其中许多最初是通过

年《宅地法案》获得的，该法案使土地所有权广泛存在。其中许多地方通过对学校进行大量投资，建立了基础广泛的财富历史，这促成了几代人的高毕业率和大学入学率。利用现有的最佳数据，我们发现他们的暴力犯罪率、收入不平等和公共腐败率是全国最低的。这些县的社会资本异常丰富：居民通过志愿服务、公民组织成员资格以及参与其他社区活动相互联系。<br><br>这些地方并非没有挑战。年轻大学毕业生的当地就业机会有时有限。然而，这些社区在预防贫困、促进健康和确保儿童享有公平的竞争环境方面比大多数社区更加成功。<br><br>如果不考虑历史上（和持续的）对移民劳工（大部分来自美国边境地区）的剥削，人们就无法完全理解在美国最有利的地方所享受到的好处。更重要的是，许多最有利的地方都毗邻土著民族，而这些地方往往属于最不利的地方。这些地方的历史深深地、不可逆转地交织在一起。我们参观了南达科他州布法罗县的克罗溪保留地，该保留地在我们的指数中排名第四。 1863 年，血腥的美达科他战争结束后，这里的居民被驱逐出明尼苏达州西南部的富饶土地。美洲原住民也有数百人丧生，其中一些是在战争中丧生，但大多数人在被强行迁移到几乎不适合人类居住的土地上后死于饥饿。<br><br>中西部北部地区也以白人为主。当我们检查白种人与指数排名之间的关系时，我们发现较高比例的白人居民是一个地方排名的重要预测因素，当人们认为好学校和好工作长期存在时，这并不奇怪。白人被慷慨地授予，而西班牙裔和美国黑人则被拒绝。<br><br>但种族并不像不平等程度、失业率或教育程度那样具有预测性。此外，许多白人比例过高的地方，如俄亥俄州、缅因州、伊利诺伊州、印第安纳州、蒙大拿州、密歇根州和爱达荷州，甚至没有跻身美国优势地区的前一半之列。最有优势的社区的独特之处在于它们作为广泛财富所在地的历史。如果该国其他地区采取类似、公平的做法，情况会有何不同？<br><br>教训是，当不平等程度较低时，人们似乎会蓬勃发展——并不总是在高薪方面，而是在健康和生活机会方面；当土地所有权普遍存在时；当社会关系较高时；当腐败和暴力很少发生时。中西部北部社区的社会等级特征不仅仅是一种奇特的文化特征。它是社区福祉的基础。在这些地区的优点在全国范围内共享之前，贫困和劣势将继续困扰美国。<br><br><small><em>本文改编自即将出版的新书<a

Relationships]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>我是一名儿童心理医生。这就是芭比的正确做法。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/D61crg47aiTtg01SRVitvtcVDUk=/0x0:1920x1080/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/barbie-1/original.jpg" alt="芭比电影的剧照。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>华纳兄弟影业公司</figcaption></figure>当我还是个小女孩的时候，我玩芭比娃娃的最基本原因你可以想象：她太<i>漂亮</i>了。可爱的服装，闪亮的金发，以及她看起来像那样的所有乐趣。几年后，当我作为一个成年女性去看<i>芭比娃娃的</i>电影时，我毫不怀疑这部电影将解决与如何看待芭比娃娃相关的明显问题：她的性感身体在男性目光的注视下产生的影响。心里，曾对像我这样的一代又一代的女孩子着迷不已。但我并没有准备好这部电影将如何阐明一个不同的主题：母女之间的紧张关系，以及她们常常沮丧地需要看到对方并感觉被对方看到。<br><br>作为一名在纽约市工作的儿童精神科医生，我每天都要处理母女问题。我在电影中的少女角色萨莎中认识了我的许多病人，她有幸列举了芭比娃娃的缺点。在谈到玛格特·罗比的芭比娃娃时，她说道：“你让女权运动倒退了 50 年。你摧毁了女孩与生俱来的自我价值感。”对于一个如此清晰地看到芭比娃娃缺陷的人来说，萨莎在做出正义的击倒时出人意料地情绪激动。当然，她是一个拒绝童心和玩具的青少年。当然，她是在向朋友们炫耀。但这种咆哮如此激烈，因为愤怒是真实的——因为，据我们所知，这是针对个人的：这是关于她母亲的。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">阅读：理解芭比电影的令人惊讶的关键</a><br><br>萨莎的母亲格洛丽亚后来在电影的中心独白中说道，虽然这在某种程度上是可以预见的，但“成为女人实际上是不可能的”。但和许多现代母亲一样，格洛丽亚在克服她所哀叹的悖论方面做了令人印象深刻的工作。她善良、漂亮，但仍然是“姐妹情谊”的一部分。当她的丈夫坐在家里使用 Duolingo 时，她努力工作，但她优雅地接受了女儿的所有批评。拥有一位“完美妈妈”——一位渴望成为男爵的妈妈——是萨莎对芭比的愤怒的根源。<br><br>女孩通过认同生活中的成年人来培养自尊，对她们中的许多人来说，最重要的是认同她们的母亲。他们需要将母亲理想化为榜样，但他们也需要与她建立联系，在她身上认识到自己。当母亲过于完美时，她的女儿就会感到孤独，或者更糟糕的是，感到有缺陷。对于一个有这种感觉的女孩来说，像萨莎那样，倾向于“奇怪、黑暗和疯狂”的身份并不罕见，这就是我的很多病人来到我办公室的原因。<br><br>首先，我会见到一位美丽、成功的十几岁女孩的妈妈，她进来为我讲述她女儿的历史。妈妈似乎把这一切都放在一起，对女儿为什么挣扎，特别是为什么她看起来对她如此生气感到困惑。人们常常担心女儿如何向世界展示自己。 “为什么她需要穿着那件暴露的露脐上衣露出那么多肚子？”或者，相反：“她为什么不关心看起来漂亮呢？”<br><br>那我就去见见女儿吧。我见过十几岁的女孩把饼干藏在房间里，这样她们瘦小的妈妈就不会评判她们。我认识一些年轻女性，她们很感激 TikTok 曝光了“杏仁妈妈”，她会告诉你是否饿了，只需吃几颗杏仁即可。我听说过：“即使她什么也没说，我也知道她在评判我。”我见过一些妈妈对女儿的饮食习惯、身体和外貌公然批评。我也见过那些从不说什么的人，但他们的女儿仍然感到受到评判。 Whether the daughters are projecting or picking up on something real—spoken or unspoken, from the mom or from our culture—I&#39;ve found that it&#39;s hard for girls to escape adolescence without feeling like their mother is judging them in some way.<br><br> My mother always tells the same story about her mother, who prized beauty in all of its forms, whether an antique dresser or a garden tomato: “She&#39;d tell me, &#39;Take off your glasses! Put on your lipstick!&#39;” My mother hated it. She rebelled by “forgetting” to wear makeup, but her (effortless, infuriating) beauty was proof that she still got the message. When I was growing up, she may never have told me to wear mascara, but she never failed to remind me to not eat bread. Regardless of whether I rebelled—whether I ordered pizza or made myself a “girl dinner”—I, too, got the message. And so it is for many of us who harbor an inner teenager: A simple “You look great” from your mom implies the insult that there was perhaps another time when you didn&#39;t.<br><br> One young woman recently cried in my office, describing how her mother has grown less supportive and more resentful the more successful my patient becomes. It&#39;s difficult for her to take any pleasure in her own success, having been cast out of the incubator of mother&#39;s encouragement. Envy between mothers and daughters can permeate even the most loving relationships, and it cuts in both directions. Some psychoanalysts believe that the envy daughters feel for their “perfect” moms begins in infancy, when the baby perceives the mother as having everything the baby needs, having all the answers—being one of the “haves” when the baby, unable to solve its own problems, is a “have-not.”<br><br> Mothers, for their part, can feel obligated to sacrifice their own identity and desires as they care for their daughters, and often feel like they deteriorate as their daughters blossom. As <i>Barbie</i> ’s Gloria, who loves her daughter and loves being a mom, says: “I never have any fun!” Maternal envy is ordinary, but when it goes unchecked, a mother&#39;s attention can feel less like a warm glow and more like a harsh spotlight.<br><br> The tragedy I often witness is that mothers and daughters want to love each other and to get along, to be recognized from a place of deep concern but no judgment. In my office, a mother will often say that she is just trying to be helpful; her critiques arise from an abundance of care. A daughter will respond that she does not need this kind of help; she wants love that does not hurt so much. Their hearts are in the right place, but the right place seems eternally uninhabitable.<br><br> What these girls want is what Barbie has with her mother figure in the movie. We ultimately meet her creator, Ruth Handler—sitting in a peachy haze in a quaint kitchen, a vision of domestic comfort. And we get to see what happens to Barbie—healing, glowing restoration—in Ruth&#39;s gaze:<br><br> “I don&#39;t usually look like this. I normally look perfect,” Barbie says.<br><br> “I think you&#39;re just right,” Ruth says sweetly and wisely, love shining forth from her eyes.<br><br> Ultimately, Barbie needs her mother&#39;s approval, just like the teenage girls in my office do. It is Ruth&#39;s tender regard for Barbie that helps her find the courage to separate from her past and become her own person—to reject remaining an object in favor of becoming a subject.<br><br> But Barbie is not an actual daughter, and Ruth is not actually her mother.  Ruth is a fantasy mother who sits in her kitchen, frozen in time, with a perpetually hot cup of tea and no needs of her own.  She never had to nag Barbie to take a shower or eat a healthy snack, and she certainly does not have to pull this off while responding to work emails and trying to make dinner. In fact, Ruth voices one of the movie&#39;s most troubling messages: “Mothers stand still so our daughters can look back to see how far they have come.” (Seriously, Ruth?) Likewise, Barbie did not grow up with Ruth, did not spend her life being cared for and scrutinized by her. The Ruth in this movie has little to do but accept and adore Barbie, and Barbie has no reason to search for the hidden judgment in Ruth&#39;s loving eyes—she is more fairy godmother than actual mother. In a sense, Ruth is the Barbie of mothers: equally unreal.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-girlhood-greta-gerwig/674821/">Meghan O&#39;Rourke: American girlhood culture is really strange</a><br><br> Thankfully, the movie offers another, more accessible way for mothers and daughters to see each other clearly. When not striving to “have it all,” Gloria (the only real mother in the film) makes drawings of curious Barbies—“Irrepressible Thoughts of Death Barbie” and “Cellulite Barbie” and “Crippling Shame Barbie.” At first, Gloria seems embarrassed by these artistic efforts, but they ultimately break the tension with her daughter: “They&#39;re weird and dark and crazy—everything you pretend not to be,” Sasha says. The drawings play a magical role in the plot, disrupting Barbie&#39;s perfect Barbieland life and setting her on her quest. And it is in this quiet moment of honesty that Sasha finally sees her mother as a person she can relate to.<br><br> Mother-daughter relationships are inevitably tainted by family history, cultural history, and a prism of mothers&#39; and daughters&#39; projected insecurities. We can&#39;t all be Ruth. And a real teenage girl who feels dark and weird inside wants a dark and weird role model, not a Ruth. What matters, above all, is the endless desire for connection. Although it&#39;s impossible to get the balance right at all times, fortunately, Barbie realizes at the end of the movie that she must reject what is impossible in favor of what is real.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 05 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/barbie-movie-mother-daughter-relationship/674931/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/barbie-movie-mother-daughter-relationship/674931/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Western Diplomats Need to Stop Whining About Ukraine]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Allies can be exasperating. But try being invaded by your neighbor and lectured by everyone else. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/trqZT4RYYt7CGtPzyvGix5fBD8o=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/ukraine/original.jpg" alt="拿着导弹的士兵" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Tyler Hicks / The New York Times / Redux</figcaption></figure> “The history of all coalitions is a tale of the reciprocal complaints of allies.” Thus said Winston Churchill, who knew whereof he spoke. This summer of discontent has been one punctuated by complaints: from Ukrainian officials desperate for weapons, and from Western diplomats and soldiers who think that the Ukrainians are ungrateful for the tanks, training, and other goods they have received.<br><br> Most of the Western sputtering occurred in and around last month&#39;s NATO summit in Vilnius, Lithuania, through anonymous leaks and public grumbles. Indeed, according to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/07/13/zelensky-ukraine-nato-invitation/">one report</a> <u>,</u> the US administration was so miffed by Volodymyr Zelensky&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1678707674811187200?s=20">complaint</a> about the slowness of the NATO accession process that some advocated watering down language about NATO membership for Kyiv. Withdrawing the word <em>invitation</em> from the communiqué would, in their view, be a suitable punishment for a mean tweet.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ukraine-war-us-aid-nato/674747/">Phillips Payson O&#39;Brien: Stop micromanaging the war in Ukraine</a><br><br> One gasps at the petulance on display here, as at otherwise staunch British Defense Minister Ben Wallace&#39;s snap about Ukraine treating its Western suppliers as a kind of Amazon of weaponry.<br><br> Peevishness about allies is a common and understandable mood that all senior diplomats and national-security officials eventually experience. A monologue sooner or later goes on in their heads that sounds something like this:<br><br> <em>I&#39;m lucky if I get a decent night&#39;s sleep once a week. I leave work before my kids are up and get back after they&#39;re asleep, six and sometimes seven days a week. I stress eat and can&#39;t take a vacation without being called back to the office. Meanwhile, everybody thinks that the [insert ally&#39;s name] are a bunch of victims or heroes, when they are, in fact, manipulative, ungrateful little bastards who don&#39;t have a clue what I am doing to save them from [name a rival official, nation, or department of government]. And their American sympathizers are a bunch of nasty dupes who are just as ignorant, but with fewer excuses.</em><br><br> The adult thing to do in such cases is to get in a workout, complain to one&#39;s loving spouse, or commit these thoughts to a diary for the delectation of historians who will read too much into what are, in sober hindsight, mere tantrums. To mention them to the press, or, even worse, act upon them is unfair and irresponsible.<br><br> Such eruptions occur when officials let their irritations suppress their empathy. At the moment of peak whine, they forget what it means to have a fifth of your country occupied, or to know that a far bigger country is attempting, every night, to smash your power plants, blockade your ports, and destroy your crops. They are not holding in the forefront of their minds obliterated towns and mass graves. They do not know what it is to welcome back exchanged prisoners of war who have been castrated. Or to mourn old men and women murdered, or younger men and women tortured and raped. Or to worry frantically about thousands of children kidnapped. They forget that while a Western official&#39;s sleep may be interrupted by a phone call or an alarm clock, a Ukrainian official&#39;s sleep is more likely (and more often) interrupted by a siren or the crash of a missile slamming into an apartment block.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/russia-kidnapping-abducting-ukrainian-children/674535/">Read: The children Russia kidnapped</a><br><br> Ukrainian officials are thankful. Analysis of their speeches reveals plenty of expressions of gratitude. But they are also insistent and vociferous in their cries for help. They would be both inhuman and derelict in their duty if they were to be anything else. Hopefully, after a whiskey (or two) on the plane back to Washington or London, Western officials simmer down and return to some level of maturity in understanding their beleaguered ally.<br><br> Unfortunately, the impulse behind the whining can also manifest in subtler, but no less pernicious, forms. Much of the public discussion of Ukraine reveals a tendency to patronize that country and others that escaped Russian rule. As Toomas Ilves, a former president of Estonia, acidly observed, “When I was at university in the mid-1970s, no one referred to Germany as &#39;the former Third Reich.&#39; And yet today, more than 30 years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, we keep on being referred to as &#39;former Soviet bloc countries.&#39;” Tropes about Ukrainian corruption abound, not without reason—but one may also legitimately ask why so many members of Congress enter the House or Senate with modest means and leave as multimillionaires, or why the children of US presidents make fortunes off foreign countries, or, for that matter, why building in New York City is so infernally expensive.<br><br> The latest, richest example of Western condescension came in a report by German military intelligence that complains that although the Ukrainians are good students in their training courses, they are not following Western doctrine and, worse, are promoting officers on the basis of combat experience rather than theoretical knowledge. Similar, if less cutting, views have leaked out of the Pentagon.<br><br> Criticism by the German military of any country&#39;s combat performance may be taken with a grain of salt. After all, the Bundeswehr has not seen serious combat in nearly eight decades. In Afghanistan, Germany was notorious for having considerably fewer than 10 percent of its thousands of in-country troops outside the wire of its forward operating bases at any time. One might further observe that when, long ago, the German army did fight wars, it, too, tended to promote experienced and successful combat leaders, as wartime armies usually do.<br><br> American complaints about the pace of Ukraine&#39;s counteroffensive and its failure to achieve rapid breakthroughs are similarly misplaced. The Ukrainians indeed received a diverse array of tanks and armored vehicles, but they have far less mine-clearing equipment than they need. They tried doing it our way—attempting to pierce dense Russian defenses and break out into open territory—and paid a price. After 10 days they decided to take a different approach, more careful and incremental, and better suited to their own capabilities (particularly their precision long-range weapons) and the challenge they faced. That is, by historical standards, fast adaptation. By contrast, the United States Army took a good four years to develop an operational approach to counterinsurgency in Iraq that yielded success in defeating the remnants of the Baathist regime and al-Qaeda-oriented terrorists.<br><br> A besetting sin of big militaries, particularly America&#39;s, is to think that their way is either the best way or the only way. As a result of this assumption, the United States builds inferior, mirror-image militaries in smaller allies facing insurgency or external threat. These forces tend to fail because they are unsuited to their environment or simply lack the resources that the US military possesses in plenty. The Vietnamese and, later, the Afghan armies are good examples of this tendency—and Washington&#39;s postwar bad-mouthing of its slaughtered clients, rather than critical self-examination of what it set them up for, is reprehensible.<br><br> The Ukrainians are now fighting a slow, patient war in which they are dismantling Russian artillery, ammunition depots, and command posts without weapons such as American ATACMS and German Taurus missiles that would make this sensible approach faster and more effective. They know far more about fighting Russians than anyone in any Western military knows, and they are experiencing a combat environment that no Western military has encountered since World War II. Modesty, never an American strong suit, is in order.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/ukraine-victory-russia-defeat/674112/">Eliot A. Cohen: It&#39;s not enough for Ukraine to win. Russia has to lose.</a><br><br> One way to increase understanding among Ukraine&#39;s friends would be to put substantial military legations in Kyiv. American colonels and generals do not have to go on patrols or storm tree lines, but they would benefit from continuous, in-country, face-to-face contact with their Ukrainian counterparts. They would be able to communicate realistic assessments of the fighting and of Ukrainian tactical and operational requirements. They would also convey to Ukraine a reassurance that videoconferences cannot, and perhaps bring a bit of humility to deliberations in Washington.<br><br> Such an effort entails risks, but that&#39;s what soldiers sign up for. Maintaining a continuous physical presence in Ukraine with a high-level military mission, supplemented by frequent visits from the head of the US European Command and other senior leaders, would be invaluable in making the judgments that could help Ukraine defeat Russia, regain its territory, and win this war. And winning, not whining, is what it&#39;s all about.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 19:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/ukraine-western-diplomacy/674920/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/ukraine-western-diplomacy/674920/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Problem With ‘Why Do People Live in Phoenix?’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> America&#39;s hottest city is still booming. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/FXYMccJUltj78IFoQSin7Y8Kc9U=/0x0:2999x1687/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/h_15598843/original.jpg" alt="2020 年 6 月 18 日，从南山公园拍摄的亚利桑那州凤凰城。前景是棕色的山丘，背景是城市的天际线。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Cassidy Araiza / Redux</figcaption></figure> In Phoenix, a high of 108 degrees Fahrenheit now somehow counts as a respite. On Monday, America&#39;s hottest major city ended its ominous streak of 31 straight days in which temperatures crested past 110. The toll of this heat—a monthly average of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/01/weather/phoenix-us-heatwave-streak-climate/index.html">102.7 degrees</a> in July—has been brutal. One woman was admitted to a hospital&#39;s burn unit after she fell on the pavement outside her home, and towering <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-phoenix-cactus-plants-974dfd0a5b19f804837d90a96b567ede">saguaros</a> have dropped arms and collapsed. Over the past month, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/17/weather/southwest-us-arizona-record-heat/index.html">hospitals</a> filling up with burn and heat-stroke victims have reached capacities not seen since the height of the pandemic.<br><br> “Why would anyone live in Phoenix?” You might ask that question to the many hundreds of thousands of new residents who have made the Arizona metropolis America&#39;s fastest-growing city. Last year, Maricopa County, where Phoenix sits, gained more residents than <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/population-estimates-counties.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">any other county in the United States</a> —just as it did in 2021, 2019, 2018, and 2017.<br><br> At its core, the question makes a mystery of something that isn&#39;t a mystery at all. For many people, living in Phoenix makes perfect sense. Pleasant temperatures most of the year, relatively inexpensive housing, and a steady increase in economic opportunities have drawn people for 80 years, turning the city from a small desert outpost of 65,000 into a sprawling metro area of more than 5 million. Along the way, a series of innovations has made the heat seem like a temporary inconvenience rather than an existential threat for many residents. Perhaps not even a heat wave like this one will change anything.<br><br> My first morning in Phoenix, more than 20 years ago, the sun broke the horizon two miles up a trail in South Mountain Park, one of the largest municipal parks in the United States. I had arrived the previous night from Michigan, leaving behind the late-March dreariness that passes for spring in the Midwest for several months of research that would become my book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/power-lines-phoenix-and-the-making-of-the-modern-southwest-andrew-needham/9780691173542?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Power Lines</em></a> . As the sun turned the mountain golden and I stripped down to short sleeves for the first time in months, I realized the Valley of the Sun&#39;s charms.<br><br> Outside the summer months, the quality of life in Phoenix is really quite high—a fact that city boosters have promoted stretching back to before World War II. They traded the desiccated “Salt River Valley” for the welcoming “Valley of the Sun.” Efforts to downplay the dangers of Phoenix&#39;s climate go back even further. In 1895, when Phoenix was home to a few thousand people, a local newspaper reported that it had been proved “by figures and facts” that the heat is “all a joke,” because the “sensible temperature” that people experienced was far less severe than what the thermometers recorded. “But it&#39;s a dry heat” has a long history, one in which generations of prospective newcomers have been taught to perceive Phoenix&#39;s climate as more beneficial than oppressive.<br><br> Most people surely move to Phoenix not because of the weather, but because of the housing. The Valley of the Sun&#39;s ongoing commitment to new housing development continues to keep housing prices well below those of neighboring California, drawing many emigrants priced out of the Golden State. Subdivisions have popped up in irrigated farm fields seemingly overnight. In 1955, as the home builder John F. Long was constructing Maryvale, then on Phoenix&#39;s western edge, he quickly turned a cantaloupe farm into seven model homes. Five years later, more than 22,000 people lived in the neighborhood; now more than 200,000 do. Even today, the speed of construction can create confusion, as residents puzzle over the location of Heartland Ranch or Copper Falls or other new subdivisions that include most of the 250,000 homes built since 2010.<br><br> Even in the summer, you might not always notice just how harsh of a terrain Phoenix can be. Developers engage in a struggle to secure water rights, tapping groundwater aquifers, drawing water from the Colorado River brought to the city by aqueduct, and purchasing water from local farmers. Air-conditioning is the lifeblood of Phoenix, as much a part of the city as the subway system is in New York. In 1961, Herbert Leggett, a Phoenix banker, spoke of his normal summer day to <em>The Saturday Evening Post</em> : “I awake in my air-conditioned home in the morning … I dress and get into my air-conditioned automobile and drive to the air-conditioned garage in the basement of this building. I work in an air-conditioned office, eat in an air-conditioned restaurant, and perhaps go to an air-conditioned theater.”<br><br> In the kind of air-conditioned bubbles Leggett described, it is actually possible for people like me, who work indoors, to forget the heat and oppression of Phoenix&#39;s summer—that is, until we have to scurry across a parking lot or cross concrete plazas between buildings. Starting in late April, when high temperatures regularly hit over 90, many residents fire up their AC, using it until October, when highs once again drop into the 80s. At the height of summer, Phoenix becomes virtually an indoor city during the day. Remote car starters become valuable amenities for taking the edge off the heat. Runners wake before dawn to exercise, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.azhumane.org/news/abc-15-hiking-ban/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20two%20years,and%20six%20months%20in%20jail.">dogs</a> are banned from hiking trails in city parks on triple-digit days. With air-conditioning, the benefits of Phoenix outweigh the drawbacks for many residents.<br><br> But this lifestyle comes with a cost. Electricity consumption has soared in Phoenix, almost doubling in the average home from 1970 to today. At the height of its operation, Four Corners Power Plant, only one of five such coal-fired power plants built north of Phoenix to help power the region&#39;s growth, emitted <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.gem.wiki/Four_Corners_Steam_Plant">16 million</a> tons of carbon annually, equivalent to the annual emissions of more than 3.4 million cars. Even today, with most coal-fired generation retired, Phoenix relies heavily on carbon-emitting natural gas for its electricity. Both the past and present of Phoenix&#39;s energy worsens the very heat its residents are trying to escape.<br><br> Air-conditioning protects most people, but especially as the heat intensifies, those without it are left incredibly vulnerable. Elderly women living alone, many of whom struggle to maintain and pay for air-conditioning, are particularly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/becoming-arizona-lessons-from-phoenix">susceptible</a> , accounting for the majority of indoor heat-related deaths. Unhoused people, whose population in Phoenix has increased by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/us/phoenix-heat-wave.html#:~:text=It%20was%20a%20record%20high,heat%20days%20is%20also%20growing.">70 percent</a> in the past six years, suffer tremendously and make up much of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/becoming-arizona-lessons-from-phoenix">death toll</a> . One unhoused man recently compared sitting in his wheelchair to “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/13/phoenix-heat-wave-conditions/">sitting down on hot coals</a> .”<br><br> This heat wave will end, but there will be another. Still, the horror stories of life in 115 degrees is hardly guaranteed to blunt Phoenix&#39;s explosive growth. There are currently building permits for 80,000 new homes in the Phoenix metro area that have not yet commenced construction—homes that will require more water, more AC, and more energy.<br><br> But in a sense, nothing about Phoenix is unusual at all. The movement from air-conditioned space to air-conditioned space that Leggett described—and the massive energy use that makes it all run—is now typical in a country where nearly 90 percent of homes use air-conditioning. Clothing companies such as Land&#39;s End <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.landsend.com/article/best-summer-sweaters-for-the-office/">advertise</a> summer sweaters that “will come to your rescue while you&#39;re working hard for those eight hours in your office, which might feel like an icebox at times.” And heat has claimed lives in “temperate” cities such as Omaha, Seattle, and Boston. Indeed, one 2020 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.lww.com/environepidem/Fulltext/2020/06000/Estimating_the_number_of_excess_deaths.1.aspx?context=LatestArticles">study</a> concluded that the Northeast had the highest rate of excess deaths attributable to heat.<br><br> “Why would anyone live in Phoenix?” serves as nothing more than a defensive mechanism. It makes peculiar the choices that huge numbers of Americans have made, often under economic duress—choices to move to the warm climates of the Sun Belt, to move where housing is affordable, to ignore where energy comes from and the inequalities it creates, and, above all, to downplay the threats of climate change. In that way, Phoenix isn&#39;t the exception. It&#39;s the norm.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 16:36:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/phoenix-record-excessive-heat-wave-streak/674924/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/phoenix-record-excessive-heat-wave-streak/674924/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[You’re Probably Drinking Enough Water]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> If you&#39;re a healthy person worried about hydration, odds are, you&#39;re getting plenty.

The health chatter was all about fat and carbs; children routinely subsisted on a single pouch of Capri Sun a day. Even athletes were discouraged from sipping on fields and race tracks, lest the excess liquid slow them down. “I can&#39;t tell you how many people told me I was stupid,” Stookey told me, for being one of water&#39;s few advocates.<br><br> But around the turn of the millennium, hydration became an American fixation. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/celebrities-and-bottled-w_b_705534">Celebrities</a> touted water&#39;s benefits in magazines; branded bottles overran supermarket shelves. Academic research on hydration underwent a mini-boom. After ages of being persistently parched, we were suddenly all drinking, drinking, drinking, because we felt like we should. It was an aquatic about-face—and it didn&#39;t make total scientific sense.<br><br> The importance of hydration, in the abstract, is indisputable. Water keeps our organs chugging and our muscles agile; it helps distribute nutrients through the body and maintains our inner thermostat. Take it away, and cells inevitably die. But the concrete specifics of adequate water intake are still, in large part, a mess. For hydration, “there are no clear numbers, or a threshold you have to maintain,” says Yasuki Sekiguchi, a sports-performance scientist at Texas Tech University. Experts <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26885571/">don&#39;t agree</a> on <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/12/1928">how much water people need</a> , or the best ways to tell when someone should drink; they differ on how to measure hydration, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/well/live/how-much-water-should-I-drink.html">which beverages are adequately hydrating</a> , and how much importance to attribute to thirst. They have yet to reach quorum on what hydration—a process that&#39;s sustained life since its primordial inception— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/12/1928">fundamentally <em>is</em></a> <em>.</em> The murkiness has left the field of hydration research, still relatively young and relatively small, rife with “vicious camps against each other,” says Tamara Hew-Butler, an exercise physiologist at Wayne State University.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/the-dos-and-donts-of-hydrating-in-a-heat-wave/674704/">Read: Drink more water</a><br><br><br> Forget, for instance, one of water&#39;s most persistent myths: the oft-repeated advice to down eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day. No one can say for certain, but one theory is that the idea  sprouted from a misinterpretation of a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00365.2002">nutrition document from the 1940s</a> , which stated that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1753-6405.2012.00866.x">2.5 liters</a> of water a day (that is, approximately <em>10</em> 8-ounce glasses) was “a suitable allowance for adults” in “most instances.” The guidance also noted, in the very same paragraph, “Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.” But the bigger issue is this: Probably <em>no</em> single number for water intake will ever suffice—not for a population of people with varying weights, genetics, diets, and activity levels, living in varying climates. Even within an individual, what&#39;s best will change through a lifetime. The answer to <em>How much water should I be drinking?</em> is invariably <em>Uh, it really depends.</em><br><br> Today&#39;s hydration zeitgeist seems to hold that no amount of water is too much. The market teems with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://waterminder.com/#:~:text=Track%20your%20hydration%20progress%20and,your%20progress%20at%20a%20glance.">intake-tracking smartphone apps</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Gallon-Water-Bottle-Time-Marker/dp/B08FX8GSJP/ref=asc_df_B08FX8GSJP/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=642093966697&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=12400949120116405475&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001913&amp;hvtargid=pla-1463145819529&amp;psc=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwt52mBhB5EiwA05YKoyvwqbDz1ymSSYjRLCOU-cJXFthzcag4GE2t9sTjDKWb3XWrF4fNixoCcKgQAvD_BwE">time-stamped</a> bottles that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B18R9JXY/ref=syn_sd_onsite_desktop_0?ie=UTF8&amp;pf_rd_p=440d6fd0-c026-415a-b337-b91e955ddf42&amp;pf_rd_r=Z21GBTP3ZHMTW0E6GRED&amp;pd_rd_wg=fN5eQ&amp;pd_rd_w=GCDJH&amp;pd_rd_r=f47b4a65-b50a-4641-b269-3bc388eaf785&amp;th=1">cheer</a> drinkers toward hydration goals as high as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BuildLife-Motivational-Fitness-Capacity-Throughout/dp/B07NWCHJTP/ref=asc_df_B07NWCHJTP/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=343257910216&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16597572817028404074&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001913&amp;hvtargid=pla-729029777688&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=66485480382&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=343257910216&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16597572817028404074&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001913&amp;hvtargid=pla-729029777688">a gallon</a> a day—a quota astronomical enough to be stressful, even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/7/1539">dangerous</a> , should people flood their bodies all at once. But America&#39;s hydration hype machine “has established a narrative that we are all walking around dehydrated, and need to drink more,” Hew-Butler told me. It&#39;s no wonder that some people have reported legitimate <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://happiful.com/what-is-dehydration-anxiety">anxiety</a> over falling short on water intake.<br><br> No single source sold America on water. But a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/podcasts/decoder-ring/2021/04/decoder-ring-the-history-of-hydration">2021 episode</a> of the podcast <em>Decoder Ring</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sporkful.com/how-did-staying-hydrated-become-a-thing/">points to Gatorade</a> as one of the first companies to pitch dehydration as a health problem—while simultaneously offering a cure. The company&#39;s sports drinks were originally billed as thirst-quenchers, designed to stave off performance dips. But by the 1980s, <em>Decoder Ring</em> reported, the Gatorade Sports Science Institute was churning out data that supported the benefits of drinking before the mouth got parched. A decade later, the American College of Sports Medicine was recommending that athletes consume “the maximal amount” of water they could stand to keep down.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/09/organic-gatorade-srsly/499154/">Read: The organic Gatorade illusion</a><br><br> Around the same time, during the fitness craze of the &#39;70s and &#39;80s, water was acquiring another identity: the enlightened socialite&#39;s clean drink of choice. When European companies such as Perrier and Evian <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.seriouseats.com/how-bottled-water-became-americas-most-popular-beverage">brought their bottled water to North America</a> , they <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/style/self-care/hydrate-hydrate-hydrate.html">found a market</a> among those wanting a high-end, calorie- and sweetener-free alternative to sodas, alcohol, and juice. Water “had this healthy, good-for-you halo,” says Michael Bellas, the chair and CEO of the Beverage Marketing Corporation. “There were no negatives.” In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bottledwater.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BMC2016_BWR_StatsArticle.pdf">2016</a> , water became the US&#39;s leading bottled beverage, a title it has maintained since.<br><br> As water&#39;s market share grew, so did its mythos. Companies hocked the illusion that their products could make people not just healthier but “sexier and more popular,” Peter Gleick, the author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-three-ages-of-water-prehistoric-past-imperiled-present-and-a-hope-for-the-future-peter-gleick/9781541702271?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Three Ages of Water</em></a> , told me. Hydration was so clearly vital to life that truth-adjacent ideas about its benefits, many of them pushed by prominent people, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/09/12/obama-michelle-drink-water-project-politico/2803417/">were easy to buy</a> . Even concerns over single-use plastic bottles could not slow water&#39;s roll: In response, the world cooked up eco-friendly Yetis, HydroFlasks, and Nalgenes, and made those trendy, too.<br><br> It&#39;s not that water <em>isn&#39;t</em> healthy <em>.</em> There&#39;s just no evidence to show that guzzling tons of water can fix all our ailments. For people prone to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632658/">kidney stones and UTIs</a> , drinking more has been shown to cut down on risks; as a swap for sugary beverages, it can also help with weight loss. But for a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/upshot/no-you-do-not-have-to-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html">variety of other issues</a> —such as heart disease, metabolic issues, and cancer—the data is often “really mixed,” Hew-Butler told me. Although researchers have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1159%2F000479640">sometimes found evidence</a> that dehydration may <em>raise</em> certain conditions&#39; risks, that doesn&#39;t automatically imply the inverse—that extra water intake then <em>lowers</em> risk from a typical baseline. At very rare extremes, overdoing it on water can kill us, too.<br><br> The connections between hydration and health are shaky enough that health authorities have been reluctant to push a strict <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/HealthInformation/nutrientrecommendations.aspx">recommended daily allowance</a> , like the ones that exist for various vitamins. Instead, the National Academy of Medicine proposes a tentative “adequate intake”: 3.7 liters of total water intake for men, and 2.7 for women (both including hydration from food). Recently, Abigail Colburn, a physiology researcher at Yale, and her colleagues <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35943601/">ran an analysis</a> that concluded those figures were sound. Still, the numbers came from population surveys, published in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2004/02/report-sets-dietary-intake-levels-for-water-salt-and-potassium-to-maintain-health-and-reduce-chronic-disease-risk">early aughts</a> , of the amounts that Americans were <em>already</em> drinking—a reflection of how things <em>were</em> , but not necessarily how they <em>should be.</em> And they represent medians within a huge range. Over the years, multiple studies have documented people living, by all appearances healthfully, on daily water budgets that span less than a liter to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/12/1928">four, five, or six—sometimes more</a> .<br><br> If researchers don&#39;t agree on how much water is good, they also differ on how little water is bad: the point at which dehydration starts to become a problem—or how long people can linger at that threshold without raising long-term health risks.<br><br> A bit of water loss should be completely fine. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25346594/">Fluid status</a> is, by design, “a constantly changing state,” Colburn told me. When the body doesn&#39;t take in enough water to recoup the liquid it&#39;s lost—as it naturally does throughout the day, via sweat, urine, and breath—the brain releases a hormone called vasopressin that prompts the kidneys to hold onto fluid. The urine gets darker and less voluminous; eventually, blood-salt levels rise, and the mouth and throat ache with thirst. The goal is to get the body to excrete less water out and take more in so we don&#39;t wring our vital tissues dry. Life forms have evolved to tread carefully down this cascade of steps, and the flexibility is built in—much like a rubber band that snaps back after being stretched and released.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/why-drink-more-water/279591/">Read: Why &#39;drink more water&#39;?</a><br><br> But some researchers have started to worry about repeatedly asking the body to compensate for less than optimal hydration—stretching the band over and over again. The issue isn&#39;t chronic <em>de</em> hydration, Colburn told me, but a subtler precursor state called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-018-01889-z"><em>under</em> hydration</a> , which occurs after a lack of water intake has prompted the body to conserve but before the appearance of signals such as thirst. It&#39;s not clear how worrying teetering on that precipice is. In the same way a rubber band is “designed to stretch,” our fluid balance is built to bounce back, says Evan Johnson, a hydration expert at the University of Wyoming. Over time, though, wear and tear could add up, and resilience could drop.<br><br> Tracking those outcomes gets even more complicated when researchers try to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28614817/">quantify</a> how dehydrated individual people are—another thing that experts can&#39;t agree on. “We really don&#39;t have a gold standard for measuring the all-encompassing term of hydration,” Johnson told me, especially one that&#39;s both simple and cheap, and can account for body water&#39;s constant flux. Which leaves scientists with imperfect proxies. Broadly speaking, there&#39;s a urine camp and a blood camp, Stookey told me. Those in the pee camp tend to be hydration conservatives. A change in urine color or volume, they argue, is an early sign—well in advance of thirst—of impending dehydration. The blood-camp crew is more laissez-faire. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25346594/">Diet, medications, and supplements</a> can all alter the shade of urine, making it a fickle clue; Hew-Butler for instance, defines true dehydration as what happens when the plasma&#39;s gotten saltier than usual, to the point where cells have started to shrink—a sign that retaining water is no longer sufficient, and that the body needs to drink <em>.</em><br><br> Which camp researchers fall into <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/upshot/no-you-do-not-have-to-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html">influences</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28614817/">how bad they think America&#39;s hydration problem is</a> . “When you draw blood, most people are within a normal range if they&#39;re not thirsty,” Hew-Butler told me. But Stookey, who&#39;s firmly in the pee camp, contends that a majority of Americans are “walking around dehydrated” and should be drinking far more. Colburn, too, would rather err on the side of heeding urine&#39;s warning signs. By the time thirst kicks in, “you&#39;re already in a dangerous zone,” she told me.<br><br> There can be a middle ground. Sekiguchi, of Texas Tech, told me that for most young, healthy people who are spending plenty of time in the air-conditioned indoors—as so many Americans do—it&#39;s probably fine to just drink when thirsty. (That advice works less well for older people, because the sensation of thirst tends to dull with age.) When specific circumstances shift—a stint of heavy exercise, a week of toasty days—people can take notice, and adjust accordingly.<br><br> But guidelines for typical water intake, under typical conditions, are quickly going out the window as heat waves get more frequent and intense. When temperatures skyrocket and humidity makes otherwise-cooling sweat stick stubbornly on skin, our bodies need more water to keep cool and functional, beyond what thirst alone might dictate. Part of the problem is that thirst vanishes more quickly than the body rehydrates, Sekiguchi told me, which means that people who drink until they <em>think</em> they&#39;re sated tend to replace only a fraction of the fluids that they&#39;ve lost.<br><br><br> “We&#39;re never going to be able to tell people an exact number,” Colburn told me, for how much to drink. But in reality, many of the healthy people most worried about fine-tuning their hydration to a perfect level are probably among those that <em>least</em> need to fret. The dangers of water tend to happen not in those middle grounds, but at its extremes—especially when <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/article/2022/11/jackson-water-crisis-reveals-perils-of-neglected-infrastructure">failing infrastructure</a> hampers access to water, or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flint-water-crisis-everything-you-need-know">contamination</a> makes it undrinkable. Many of the populations that are most vulnerable to dehydration&#39;s effects also happen to be the same groups that probably aren&#39;t getting enough to drink, Johnson told me. While bottled-water markets boom, plenty of pockets of the US still lack consistent access to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/12/the-politics-of-drinking-water/384081/">safe, reliable water from the tap</a> <em>.</em> And the situation is even worse in many places abroad.

Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> Up until a few years ago, Heather Sullivan&#39;s 14-year-old son, Sawyer, had struggled with eczema his entire life. When he was just a baby, most of his body would be covered in intensely itchy rashes that bled and oozed when he couldn&#39;t help but scratch. His family tried steroid creams, wet wraps, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atopic-dermatitis-eczema/expert-answers/eczema-bleach-bath/faq-20058413">bleach baths</a> , and all of the lotions. They tore up their carpet and replaced their sheetrock in hopes of eliminating triggers. At 15 months, he went on cyclosporine, a powerful immunosuppressant usually given to organ-transplant patients. It cleared him up, but the drug comes with potentially dangerous side effects over time. Doctors, Sullivan recalls, were “just appalled that my child would be on this amount of medicine at this age”—but his eczema came roaring back as soon as he went off it.<br><br> When a new eczema drug called Dupixent finally became available to Sawyer a few years ago, his turnaround was fast and dramatic. Within a week, his itchiness and redness started calming down. He felt and looked better. The condition that had dominated their lives began to fade into the background.<br><br> Doctors who treat severe eczema now speak of pre- and post-Dupixent eras: “It changed the landscape of having eczema forever,” says Brett King, a dermatologist at Yale. Today, a half dozen novel treatments are available for the skin condition, all of which work by quieting the same biological pathway in eczema; dozens more are in clinical trials. Unlike older drugs, these new ones are precisely targeted and in many cases startlingly effective.<br><br> Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin. It&#39;s a very common condition, estimated to affect <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nationaleczema.org/research/eczema-facts/">10 percent of Americans</a> . Of those, a large minority suffer from moderate to severe eczema that seeps into everyday life. “Just imagine scratching endlessly,” King says. “You wake up from sleep scratching. Your sheets are bloody in the morning.” The most basic eczema advice is to moisturize, and moisturize often, to protect the barrier of the skin. But scientists now know that eczema&#39;s cause is not in the skin alone. Many patients also have “an over-reactive or overzealous immune system,” says Dawn Davis, a dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic. Their immune cells release chemicals that irritate nerves, causing itch, and even degrade the skin itself.<br><br> Topical steroids, such as over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, can tamp down the immune reaction that flares in eczema. If these fail, doctors have resorted to more powerful oral steroids, such as prednisone, or other oral immunosuppressants, such as the aforementioned cyclosporine. The drugs can calm eczema, but because they suppress the overall immune system, they also do much more. Prednisone, for example, makes you more <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hopkinsvasculitis.org/vasculitis-treatments/prednisone/">prone to infections</a> as well as bone fractures, high blood pressure, and glaucoma when taken in the long term. Of course, for many people, eczema is a chronic condition that requires long-term treatment. “Prednisone is kind of like carpet bombing,” says Peter Lio, a dermatologist at Northwestern University. It blasts eczema away, but at a cost.<br><br> In contrast, the newer drugs, Lio says, are more like shotguns that target specific parts of the immune system—with less collateral damage. They fall into two broad classes. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nationaleczema.org/blog/biologics-eczema-treatment/">Monoclonal antibodies</a> , such as Dupixent, intercept the immune-signaling molecules that trigger itch and skin inflammation. And then<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nationaleczema.org/blog/jak-inhibitors-research/">JAK inhibitors</a> , which include pills such as Rinvoq and the topical cream Opzelura, scramble the signal after cells have received it. The development of these drugs came after years of research zeroed in on some of the key immune molecules dysregulated in eczema. But serendipity played a role too: The first such drugs were originally developed for other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis—only to be repurposed when researchers realized that they targeted the very pathways involved in eczema. The breakthroughs in eczema treatment, in fact, are part of a broader revolution in treating inflammatory disorders; both classes of new drugs are now used to tune the immune system in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24037835/">whole host of</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9146299/">different conditions</a> .<br><br> The monoclonal antibodies and oral JAK inhibitors may have their own serious side effects, such as blood clots, which, Lio says, give some doctors unfamiliar with the new drugs—especially the latter type—pause. But the traditional drugs are not great either. “I&#39;m frustrated that a lot of clinicians are very cavalier about prednisone and cyclosporine … They&#39;re like, &#39;Oh, they&#39;re our old friends,&#39;” he told me. “Then they get nervous about JAK inhibitors.” In his mind, the new drugs are simply the better option in terms of safety and efficacy.<br><br> Jonathan Silverberg, a dermatologist at George Washington University who specializes in eczema, says he now rarely uses the old oral steroids and immunosuppressants. When he does revert to them, it&#39;s not for medical reasons: He ends up prescribing older (that is, generic and therefore cheaper) drugs for uninsured patients who can&#39;t afford the new ones, or for patients who have insurance but are nevertheless denied coverage. “Insurance says, &#39;Can it be fixed with a $10 medicine? Or does it really need the $1,000 tube?&#39;” King told me. Getting patients these newer drugs can mean a lot of time fighting with insurance.<br><br> For now, these drugs have most dramatically improved the lives of patients with moderate to severe eczema—at least those patients who can access them. But doctors told me that topical JAK inhibitors, which are safer than the oral version, could one day be first-line treatments for mild eczema as well. “In a perfect world, I would love it if I never had to prescribe a topical steroid again,” Silverberg said, citing the side effects that come with long-term use. Topical steroids can thin the skin, causing stretch marks, fragility, and poor healing. But at the moment, steroids are also cheap and easily available. They&#39;re not going anywhere as long as the new treatments still come with hefty price tags.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/eczema-treatment-dupixent/674918/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/eczema-treatment-dupixent/674918/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Putting Trump on the Couch]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A new novel from the psychiatrist famous for <em>Listening to Prozac</em> imagines a Trumplike president&#39;s sessions with a shrink. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Ds_1-zELqwfmv6K_zr6zy5CXAmc=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/trump_therapy/original.jpg" alt="唐纳德·特朗普在沙发上" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic.

Where did politics end and psychology—or psychopathology—begin? Thus the Trump years have inevitably given rise to the routine flouting of the Goldwater Rule, most notably in a collection of writings assembled by the former Yale psychiatrist Bandy Lee, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-dangerous-case-of-donald-trump-37-psychiatrists-and-mental-health-experts-assess-a-president---updated-and-expanded-with-new-essays-bandy-x-lee/9781250212863?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 37 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President</i></a> . (Lee subsequently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/the-yale-professor-fired-for-tweeting-about-alan-dershowitz.html">got fired from Yale</a> for publicly arguing that Alan Dershowitz was suffering from a “shared psychosis” with Trump.)<br><br> Now, with Trump the Republican 2024 front-runner—his accumulating indictments notwithstanding—the psychiatrist Peter D. Kramer seems to have successfully engineered an end run around the Goldwater Rule: In his interesting and challenging new novel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/death-of-the-great-man-peter-d-kramer/9781637587966?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Death of the Great Man</i></a> , Kramer takes on some of the relevant psychological issues of the Trump era via fiction.<br><br> Kramer, the longtime Brown University medical-school professor who became internationally famous 30 years ago for writing the best-selling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/listening-to-prozac-a-psychiatrist-explores-antidepressant-drugs-and-the-remaking-of-the-self-revised-edition-peter-d-kramer/9780140266719?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Listening to Prozac</i></a> , helped transform how we think about psychopharmacology and the self. In this novel, he confronts his protagonist, an idealistic psychiatrist named Henry Farber who shares much of Kramer&#39;s biography, with the question of how and whether to provide psychotherapy to an American president who shares much of Trump&#39;s biography.<br><br> Kramer is at pains to emphasize that he doesn&#39;t intend a one-to-one correlation between his fictional president, who is referred to only as the “Great Man,” and the real-life Trump. Yet in his general behavior (he&#39;s an erratic and autocratic populist who has shredded democratic norms) and many details (he has an attractive, younger European wife, and has refused to accept defeat in his reelection campaign, which took place amid the depredations of a global pandemic), the Great Man is unmistakably Trumpian.<br><br> The Great Man is also—we learn in the novel&#39;s third sentence—dead, almost certainly murdered; his body was discovered on the couch in Farber&#39;s consulting room in Providence, Rhode Island. The novel flashes back (how did the president come to be in Farber&#39;s office?) and forward (who killed the Great Man? Will Farber get fingered for it?), but it is not a classic whodunit, because Kramer heavily seasons the mystery with stylistic elements drawn from literary fiction and political satire, which allows for both comedy and commentary. For instance, Kramer depicts the Great Man&#39;s wife, Náomi, who on the surface seems much like Melania Trump, as a literary intellectual and former dramaturge with liberal leanings and an interest in existential philosophy. So nauseated is Náomi by the moral (and literal) stench of her husband that she routinely retches when he&#39;s nearby. She also turns out to have been the secret instigator of the effort to recruit a therapist for the Great Man. She may also be his murderer.<br><br> I interviewed Kramer on Zoom earlier this summer. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.<br><br> <b>Scott Stossel:</b> What inspired this novel?<br><br> <b>Peter D. Kramer:</b> This was an epiphany. It was December of 2016, and Trump had just been elected. I was in New York, consulting on clinical cases at Cornell medical school. One of my editors had a short amount of time for me at the end of the day, and so I went to Union Square, near my publisher&#39;s offices, a little early. It was rainy, so I went into the Barnes &amp; Noble to look for books for my grandsons. I was on the escalator and the book just came to me: I thought I should write a novel that relates to Trump. The framework came to me almost whole. I went into a little corner in the children&#39;s books section and started writing notes on my phone.<br><br> And then I went in and presented my idea to the editor, and he said: “Absolutely not.” And I thought, well, this is what I have to write, and I sat down to write it anyway.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/07/a-crack-in-psychoanalytic-standards-courtesy-of-the-president/534825/">Read: Evaluating Trump&#39;s psyche in public</a><br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> What was the editor&#39;s objection?  Fear of political blowback or just “this isn&#39;t gonna sell”?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I knew from the start that this book was going to begin with a toxic populist US president dead on a psychiatrist&#39;s couch—and of course if Trump had died at some point in between the writing of the book and its publication, that wouldn&#39;t have been amusing.<br><br> This editor had another reasonable objection, which is that assassination for regime change is an illiberal expedient. It&#39;s not amusing. You can&#39;t kill off presidents—it&#39;s just morally not the right thing. But in the novel, this <i>isn&#39;t</i> murder for regime change; every character around him has a reason to want the Great Man dead. And these reasons are really only incidentally political. He&#39;s just so horrible to everyone, and so many people have their own motives for killing him.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> How close did you mean to make the Great Man to Trump? Did you start with the public Trump we all see on TV and try to imagine his inner life?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> The thinking began with Trump, but of course characters take on their own lives for the writer. I am not an expert on politics or history, so I focused on what Trump would look like to a psychotherapist. That meant I had to create what I didn&#39;t know about, which is this intimate person: How does he treat his wife? How does he treat people around him? How would he do in therapy? And I was running into this other constraint, which is that psychiatrists are not supposed to diagnose public figures from a distance. I didn&#39;t want to violate the Goldwater Rule by saying, “Oh, this is fiction” and then depicting Trump exactly. I wanted, instead, to play with the question of what psychiatrists would do if they could really get close to a Trump figure.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> The reader&#39;s mind inevitably goes to Trump because the Great Man behaves in very Trumplike ways and has a very Trumplike biography.<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> My model was the dictator fiction that&#39;s common in Latin America. In <i>The Autumn of the Patriarch</i> , Gabriel García Márquez takes a particular dictator, Gustavo Pinilla of Colombia, and adds elements of General Franco of Spain and Juan Vicente Gómez of Venezuela, and creates this outrageous version of a dictator. Márquez has him basically governing the country from the grave. So that gave me, I thought, license to create a comic character who was outrageous in certain ways. Whether he&#39;s more outrageous than Trump, I can&#39;t say. But he&#39;s outrageous in his own way, and specifically Trumplike in five or six other ways.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Let&#39;s talk about the Goldwater Rule. Don&#39;t mental-health professionals have a “duty to warn” when somebody poses a danger to themselves or others? And what if that danger posed is not to an individual but to the entire American population, which is clearly how some of the experts in the Lee book see Trump?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> The real function of the Goldwater Rule is to protect psychiatry from itself—from all these doctors expressing their <i>political</i> views through making diagnoses without a careful respect for the clinical facts. I remember an era when—this is way back—people would say, “Well, if your patient has not expressed anxiety about the atom bomb, the patient is in denial.” And I thought, <i>My patients will express whatever they express, and the introduction of uniform political views into psychiatry is a disaster</i> . I&#39;ve had patients who were very much on the front lines of the anti-abortion movement, and I am very much on the other side. But you are out to treat the patient who&#39;s in front of you—you&#39;re not out to impose your views or ask them to see things differently than they do.<br><br> You just need to deal with patients as you find them—even with patients who are racist and prejudiced and anti-Semitic or whatever. To create some kind of internal rule in psychotherapy that integrates political views is a disaster.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Let&#39;s say you have a patient referred to you with depression, and he quickly evinces extreme racist and misogynistic views, and election denialism. What would that encounter in the consulting room look like?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> This is very much one of the topics of the book. One of the worries regarding Henry Farber is that he will go and treat the Great Man, and that will just give the Great Man some ease, and make him better able to do the terrible things he does. Farber has great faith in his therapeutic method, so the setup is this: He&#39;s known—as I am—for writing a book early in his career that was a best seller, and he&#39;s also known as a sleep doctor. Later in life he&#39;s specialized in the treatment of paranoid men. And he&#39;s brought in to treat the Great Man&#39;s insomnia, but secretly there&#39;s some hope on the part of the people who bring him in that he will treat the personality problems as well. And I think Farber is comfortable with what seems like a corrupt assignment, because he just believes in his therapeutic method, which is that if he sits empathetically beside his patient—metaphorically speaking—and looks out at the world as his patient does, and gets the patient to feel what he feels and be aware of his feelings, good things will happen, that there will be some general liberation, and that will be useful both for his sleep problems and his disordered personality. But he&#39;s not trying to nudge the person in any direction; he&#39;s trying to get the person to free himself of whatever it is that constrains his feeling and thinking.<br><br> Farber&#39;s extreme commitment to this approach is comic. When the Great Man throws him into a jail cell at one point, Farber thinks, <i>How can I utilize this thing that my patient has done? The patient will indirectly notice how I behave in the jail cell, and maybe I can do that in a way that&#39;s therapeutic; I&#39;ll prepare for our next encounter by reviewing similar cases</i> . I don&#39;t know that I am self-abnegating in that way. But I do retain an idealistic faith in the therapeutic method that if you put people in touch with themselves—that&#39;s your job, and your job isn&#39;t to guide the direction of progress.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Let&#39;s say, as implausible as this is, Ivanka calls you up and says, “My father is suffering from grave depression after his brush with COVID mortality”—would you do as Farber does and take Trump on as a patient?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I would take the case in a minute. I think Farber cross-examines this stuff: Is he taking the case because this will demonstrate that he&#39;s a virtuoso of empathy, or out of his own self-aggrandizement because this is such a challenging case? I do think I would be tempted by the level of effort that would be required. I like taking on cases that I thought were difficult for me because they were unlikeable patients. (Anyone who&#39;s my patient: That wasn&#39;t you!) I do think the book is my attempt to imagine what the level of effort would be like. Farber keeps looking for the element of full humanity in his patient. When he perceives this little spark of it, he&#39;s so encouraged by it; he thinks there&#39;s something here he can work with. I think that would be a challenge with someone like Trump: sort of waiting him out until you see that little hint of something that&#39;s not propaganda and self-praise but something that has a little texture and dimensionality to it. I mean, I was really trying to imagine what that would look like for Trump.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> And what would that look like?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I think it could be exposure of vulnerability. Could just be genuine emotion. There are easy emotions like anger, which is sort of the lowest-level emotion; patients who can&#39;t access much else can often access rage. But there are other moments where I imagine under all the grievance there could be some genuine pain or sadness, and you&#39;re curious about that.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Imagine Trump meeting with a child psychiatrist when he was a younger person. Do you think this would help him process whatever the trauma of growing up with his father was?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I think it&#39;s at least possible to think that this grudge against the world, the constant sense of having been wronged, could have been diminished. That&#39;s what psychiatry that examines early-childhood injuries is out to do—free people from being in the thrall of their resentment for the rest of their lives.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Allen Frances, the psychiatrist who presided over the composition of the <i>DSM-4</i> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780062394521/twilight-of-american-sanity/">has written</a> that Trump&#39;s presidency and aberrant behavior are more symptoms of culture that&#39;s gone mad than of any psychiatric illness. And Jeffrey Lieberman, a psychiatrist at Columbia, has written that Trump doesn&#39;t have any <i>DSM</i> illness—he&#39;s just “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/opinion/trump-mentally-ill.html">a jerk</a> .” Do you think there are links between various personality types and certain political ideologies or behaviors?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I know Jeff and Allen a little bit, and I don&#39;t agree with the argument “Well, this is just evil, and diagnosis has nothing to do with it.” Diagnosis aside, I think what we saw was four years of a certain kind of personality on display. And it was almost impossible to be a political analyst without wondering about certain of his actions; there wasn&#39;t enough logic in the behavior to explain it only in political terms. In the book, I write about “arbitocracy.” This isn&#39;t really authoritarianism, because it&#39;s not consistent enough, or organized well enough—not that authoritarian regimes generally are either—but this seemed to be even more arbitrary and herky-jerky. So, yes, I think personality is relevant in talking about the politics of Trump.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> I know you don&#39;t want to diagnose Trump. But having sat, as Henry Farber, in therapy sessions with the imaginary Great Man, what would you diagnose Great Man with? If he&#39;s gonna file an insurance claim, that requires your giving him a <i>DSM</i> diagnosis, right?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/donald-trump-not-well/597640/">Read: Trump is not well</a><br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> Right. I&#39;m with Farber, who says that the men in his paranoid-men&#39;s group do not meet a strict by-the-book definition of paranoia; they&#39;re people who have this same kind of hypervigilant posture in the world. And he says of the Great Man, “Yes, he would qualify as one of my patients.” So it&#39;s sort of a loose paranoia for the Great Man.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Is paranoia a <i>DSM</i> disorder?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> It&#39;s a delusional disorder, which is in the <i>DSM</i> . And of course I diagnosed patients in my practice for the purpose of deciding which medicine to use, and for insurance claims. I think diagnosis is very helpful. But personality disorders—that is, borderline personality, sociopathy, or paranoia, the kinds of diagnoses that were debated with regard to Trump—were never something where I&#39;ve found the particulars that useful. Patients don&#39;t necessarily stick with one personality-disorder diagnosis—they can have one and a year later have another, or the diagnosis can even disappear, and they end up with just depression or drug abuse or something, and don&#39;t have the personality disorder. It&#39;s not a very stable diagnosis.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Are personality disorders susceptible to treatment by medication? If you were treating Trump—or, if you prefer, if Farber is treating the Great Man—is there a drug regimen that could ease their distress or make them less inclined to wreak pain and havoc on everyone around them?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> Well, the experience of treating personality disorder with medication has not been terrific. There certainly was a lot of use of SSRIs in treating borderline personality disorder, with some success and a lot of failure. I think the results were similar for lithium. In <i>Listening to Prozac</i> , I talk a lot about rejection sensitivity, a category that isn&#39;t written about a lot anymore. And people had this diagnosis of rejection sensitive dysphoria, which sometimes did well on antidepressants. It turned out that really what was going on was that their vulnerability to social insult was so great that they looked very erratic, and on medication they could be less erratic and less in pain.<br><br> But as a therapist looking at the relationship between Henry Farber and the Great Man, I wasn&#39;t tempted for Farber to reach for the prescription pad. I did not want to introduce medication to the book.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> You can&#39;t medicate a politician into making better policy.<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> Yeah. I mean, I think if you got up close to one of these political figures and saw that he had ADHD, maybe a stimulant would be calming in a paradoxical way. Or if the person really is manic, maybe lithium would be helpful. You can imagine some diagnosis that can&#39;t be made from a distance but here up close you might see something that was not as evident in these speeches and debates. Medication could possibly help with those.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 11:46:13 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/trump-goldwater-rule-death-of-the-great-man-book-review/674919/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/trump-goldwater-rule-death-of-the-great-man-book-review/674919/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Happens When a Carnival Barker Writes Intellectual History]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Christopher Rufo doesn&#39;t understand that radicals and nutjobs make universities great. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/TCj_IagmmJBDkq4dp2LzYKvhdwE=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/chris_rufo_theory_hr/original.jpg" alt="安吉拉·戴维斯和克里斯·鲁福的插图" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by The Atlantic.

Rufo is what is sometimes known as a shit-stirrer—a particular type of troublemaker whose game is to find something stinky, then waft its fumes toward the noses of those mostly likely to be outraged by it. In the past several years, controversies over race, gender, and campus leftism have ripened in part due to his publicity. Often the so-called antiracists, trans activists, and tenured radicals at the center of the controversies are self-discrediting. All Rufo has to do is quote them or post their videos on his Twitter feed—a teacher fanatically devoted to a trendy form of social justice, say, or someone preening about their identity. Even those who find their behavior outrageous often find Rufo&#39;s tactics distasteful as well. (Many of his targets strike me as mentally unbalanced.) But the thing about shit-stirrers is that even if they are distasteful or loathsome, they&#39;d be out of work if there were not already raw material to stir.<br><br> Rufo&#39;s new book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/america-s-cultural-revolution-how-the-radical-left-conquered-everything-christopher-f-rufo/9780063227538?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>America&#39;s Cultural Revolution</em></a> , is in this context surprisingly hygienic. It is not about the raw material but about the manufacturers of the porcelain vessels in which it is found. He curates a gallery of activists, academics, and Communists active in the mid- and late 20th century, and he describes how their ideas slowly took over campuses, HR departments, and leftist political circles. These figures are well known, and it is ethically refreshing to see him focus his revilement on public figures in full command of their rhetoric and ideas, rather than on possibly disturbed nobodies.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/christopher-rufo-manhattan-institute/673008/">Graeme Wood: DEI is an ideological test</a><br><br> Even more unexpected are his points of agreement with his enemies. The people Rufo names as intellectual progenitors of wokeness are in fact the same ones the most literate postliberal leftists would name: the German philosopher Herbert Marcuse, his American student Angela Davis, the educational theorist Paulo Freire, and founders of critical race theory (CRT) such as the Harvard Law professor Derrick Bell, all perennial entrants in what Jonathan Yardley once called the “America Sucks Sweepstakes.” (The most noteworthy omission is Michel Foucault.) These figures argued that the basic values of liberalism—freedom, equality, justice—are lies, and the systems and institutions that tout them are incorrigibly complicit in evil. To be “woke” is simply to be roused from the naive and dogmatic slumber in which one might dream that these lies were true. The remedy is cynical and radical: Stop believing the lies, and destroy the political and social systems that tell them.<br><br> Your appreciation of this book will depend in part on whether you prefer Rufo the carnival barker, luring in members of the public to see the lefty freakshow he curates, or Rufo the intellectual historian. The first is more fun but the second is just as biased. His description of the careers of these intellectual figures is meant for readers who know nothing of their work, and do not care to learn about it from a sympathetic source. The narrative is meant to build them up only to villainize them—and this is not difficult. Like Rufo&#39;s TikTok freaks, his woke progenitors often said and did things that need no additional commentary to make them into villains.<br><br> Marcuse said he was “honored” to be associated with Mao, who was then in the midst of killing tens of millions of people. Davis, in a famous moment of candor quoted by Rufo, once said that political prisoners behind the Iron Curtain “deserve what they get.” (Prison abolition, one of Davis&#39;s causes, evidently did not extend to the Gulag.) In 1970, Davis bought a shotgun that was used two days later to blow the head off a California judge. Paulo Freire called Mao&#39;s Cultural Revolution “the most genial solution of the century,” a line that sounds, when applied to mass starvation, straight from the mouth of Lex Luthor.<br><br> Rufo, a recent appointee of Governor Ron DeSantis to the board of New College of Florida, hates all of these people, but he is plainly fascinated by their ability to achieve political traction for their bad ideas. Take Freire, a Brazilian crackpot who taught that the path to peasant education was through Maoist class suicide. His contribution to human well-being was almost certainly a net negative—yet his book <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em> is taught in every education school in America. “History should have reduced [it] to an ideological curiosity,” Rufo writes, with what I think is grudging admiration. He quotes Marcuse saying that the way to convert his ideas into political action is to abandon direct activism and instead infiltrate institutions, to take over universities and bureaucracies, and to initiate a silent revolution that ends in a radical victory before any of the old guard is aware of what happened.<br><br> The case of CRT is particularly striking in Rufo&#39;s account. Rufo has made a bogeyman out of CRT, but it is real, radical, and influential beyond its origins in legal academia. CRT holds that white supremacy is systemic, insidious, and embedded in supposedly neutral liberal norms like color-blindness and freedom of speech. Derrick Bell argued that white supremacy is ineradicable, and that racial progress is just a veneer over a permanently rotten system. The norms and orthodoxies of a rotten system are owed no deference, because they are in fact part of the rot. Among the norms in legal academia that Bell broke was the format of the journal article, which later in life he eschewed in favor of short, didactic fiction, including a science-fiction story about white Americans selling Black people to aliens.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/ron-desantis-florida-critical-race-theory-professors/672507/">Daniel Golden: &#39;It&#39;s making us more ignorant&#39;</a><br><br> Rufo notes that these theories were widely critiqued even as they were proposed. He cites a potent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/149558/let-talk">dissent</a> from the literary critic and historian Henry Louis Gates Jr., who warned against CRT&#39;s unnerving calls to expand state power, in a manner “incompatible with democracy.” Its theorists&#39; aim was “not to resist power, but to enlist power.” When Randall Kennedy, a fellow Black legal academic, drafted another dissent, Rufo writes, “Bell personally intervened” to persuade Kennedy not to publish his critique. Kennedy published it anyway, leading Bell to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/26/opinion/l-shed-light-in-all-corners-of-academic-tenure-harvard-law-furor-974290.html">suggest</a> that he was auditioning to be an “academic minstrel” and professional race traitor. Kennedy&#39;s 2019 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3350497">essay</a> assessing Bell&#39;s legacy is revealing. He contrasts Bell&#39;s “certitude” with his own self-doubt, and he notes Bell&#39;s disregard for teaching students already motivated by racial justice “to understand and take seriously perspectives at odds with those that they embraced.” Kennedy says he attempts to teach these perspectives in courses about race; Bell considered this “a betrayal.”<br><br> Rufo is more interested in exhibiting these theories than assessing them. In most cases I would agree with him that the assessment should be negative. Freire&#39;s argument that the path to literacy lies through Maoist collectivization; Davis&#39;s belief that policing and imprisonment should be abolished; Bell&#39;s contention that <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> was wrongly decided and that “separate but [actually] equal” schooling for Blacks and whites would have been better, and that racial progress is a myth—these are all disastrous views, with grave and sometimes morally abhorrent consequences. It&#39;s reasonable to wonder, as Rufo does, how these doctrines came to be taught with so little resistance. He accurately describes the takeover of certain sectors of education as a “long march through the institutions,” a Maoist reference to Marcuse&#39;s suggestion that radicals hunker down in bureaucracies. And it&#39;s worth considering the broken safeguards that allowed this strategy to succeed.<br><br> Rufo nonetheless seems to have little idea what universities are for. This is a significant deficiency, given not only his subject matter in this book but also his position as a university trustee. In this role, Rufo envisions himself as a tribune of the people of Florida, curtailing in their name the influence of leftist professors and administrators whose views they would find objectionable, hateful, or racist. He wants to end political tests that would exclude centrists and conservatives from the faculty. He thinks the solution to the problem is democratic oversight and policing the excesses of the left, in particular by exerting political control over hiring of faculty. I see little sign of a vision for a real intellectual space—which would have to include and even embrace weird or odious speech, especially the kind many Floridians disagree with.<br><br> I would not want Davis or Freire running a Department of Justice or Education. I suspect that if they ran even a Froyo stand it would devolve, as Rufo says of a Weatherman cell, into a fiesta of “hangovers, jealousies, gonorrhea, and lice.” But that does not mean Davis and Freire are unfit for professorships. Universities are <em>precisely</em> the places where society should stash its radicals and nutjobs, and universities function best when some fraction of their faculty is certifiable. Rufo is appalled that the University of California and Harvard employ such people. I am relieved.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/new-college-florida-ron-desantis-takeover/673556/">Conor Friedersdorf: DeSantis chose the wrong college to take over</a><br><br> Consider Davis&#39;s signature intellectual achievement, which is the call to abolish prisons. On this point my view is more in line with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://youtu.be/Txp8B4ek_kk">Richard Pryor&#39;s</a> after six weeks filming in an Arizona prison. Seeing so many Black men removed from their families and communities “made my heart ache,” Pryor said. Listening to those same men describe their murders made him “thank God we have penitentiaries.”<br><br> But the idea of prison abolition is powerful and challenging. (I recommend Tommie Shelby&#39;s recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691229751/the-idea-of-prison-abolition">book</a> on the subject.) Plenty of hitherto common penal practices have been abolished: ear cropping, castration, boiling in oil, amputation. Imprisonment is a corporal punishment that involves the whole body, all at once, and under some theoretical condition, we could imagine a day when it is retired along with those other corporal punishments. Davis saw this before others, and her radicalism forces reconsideration of the most basic ideas about how American society is, and should be, organized. Her ideas (about violence, communism, prison, and much else) are bad, but bad ideas can spawn good ones. And that is one of the ways universities work, by providing spaces where bad ideas proliferate along with good ones. Rufo might retort that the current balance is off, and the bad ideas have driven out the good. But nuking the bad ideas without collateral damage among the good is impossible, and DeSantis&#39;s reforms in Florida look to me like a neutron bomb, more likely to kill off all ideas than just to reduce the bad ones.<br><br> The late novelist Cormac McCarthy was affiliated with the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), an educational and research institution best known for its programs in theoretical physics. He understood the value of having madmen around. In 2015, he drafted a new mission statement for SFI. Its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sfi-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/sfi-edu/production/uploads/ckeditor/2018/04/24/cormac-sfi.pdf">principles</a> would make better guidance than whatever DeSantis is implementing. “SFI is always pushing creativity to its practical limits. We always court a high risk of failure,” he wrote. “Occasionally we find that an invited guest is insane. This generally cheers us all up. We know we&#39;re on the right track.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/christopher-rufo-book-americas-cultural-revolution/674908/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/christopher-rufo-book-americas-cultural-revolution/674908/</item></channel></rss>
