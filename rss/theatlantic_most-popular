referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>帕特里克·普勒尔/图片联盟/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>我活了三十多年，从来没有被蜱虫咬过。事实上，这可能是一个谎言，我无法确定。因为尽管蜱虫有鱼叉状的口器，尽管某些种类的蜱虫可以吸吮<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355616/">长达两周的时间</a>，尽管有些蜱虫吸食的血液足以使体重膨胀 100 倍，但它们的叮咬却谨慎得令人不安。德克萨斯农工大学蜱虫研究员阿德拉·奥利瓦·查韦斯 (Adela Oliva Chavez) 表示，“小时候，我身上有数百只蜱虫”，其中至少有几只会咬人。然而她永远不会注意到，直到她姨妈把它们从她的皮肤上摘下来。<br><br>蜱虫隐形背后的秘密是蜱虫的<em>唾液</em>——一种奇怪的、滑溜的、多面的液体，没有生物同类<em>。</em>它可以让害虫的叮咬处保持奇异的瘙痒和疼痛，并让它们不受宿主免疫力的影响而不受阻碍地进食。随着气候变化重塑世界，唾液也帮助蜱虫进入新的栖息地和宿主，并带来许多致命的病毒、细菌和寄生虫。<br><br>尽管蜱虫非常依赖血液，但它们几乎从不吃东西。在它们有时长达数年的生命周期中，它们在每个阶段可能只进食一次：幼虫、若虫和成虫。这意味着， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/the-marvels-of-tick-saliva/594652/">正如我的同事莎拉·张曾经写道的那样，每顿饭都必须非常重要。</a>与蚊子和其他吸血昆虫可以轻易逃脱的不同，蜱虫必须在肉上停留数天甚至数周——这是一场漫长的盛宴，需要它们像临时肢体一样移植到宿主的身体上。<br><br>在整个过程中，唾液是关键。当蜱虫第一次叮咬时，它的唾液会在伤口上涂上一种胶状物质，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30459085/">将其嘴固定在适当的位置</a>。一旦安全，蜱虫就会部署<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00281/full">一系列唾液传播的化合物</a>，扩张宿主的血管，同时与通常会促使伤口凝结、愈合或因疼痛或瘙痒而刺痛的身体化合物作斗争。在大多数情况下，这种外来分子的攻击会立即集结人体的免疫骑兵。但蜱虫也有解决方法。它们的唾液具有抗炎和镇痛作用；它可以禁用细胞之间相互发送的警报，从而防止它们协调攻击。唾液甚至可以对免疫细胞进行重新编程，使它们永远无法完成发育或接收到在现场收集所需的线索。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/ticks-can-take-down-800-pound-moose/583189/">阅读：气候变化进入吸血阶段</a><br><br>所有这些策略还可以为蜱虫从一个宿主吞下然后沉积到下一个宿主的细菌、病毒和寄生虫<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.816547/full">提供便利</a>。当蜱虫的唾液突破皮肤屏障并保持免疫系统受到控制时，病原体所要做的就是随之而来。生物技术初创公司 Arcadia Science 的首席执行官 Seemay Chou 表示：“蜱虫的唾液就像一辆豪华车辆，将它们运送到感染部位并铺上红地毯。”研究表明，多种病原体在唾液的推动下会 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10118219/">增强</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01056-15">感染力</a>，更有效地扩散到新被咬伤宿主的皮肤中。伯氏疏螺旋体<em>（Borrelia burgdorferi）</em>是引起莱姆病的细菌，它甚至会将<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8001052/">蜱虫唾液的一部分像斗篷一样涂在自己身上</a>，基本上使自己<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306560/">对身体防御来说不可见</a>。蜱虫的传染性物质甚至可能会互相怂恿：纽约州北部医科大学的 Saravanan Thangamani 发现证据表明，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/7/1584">同时携带<em>伯氏疏螺旋体</em>和波瓦桑病毒的</a>蜱虫最终可能会将<em>更多</em>的后者注入新伤口中。<br><br>蜱虫向人类及其牲畜传播的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6024845/">病原体已经比任何其他昆虫或蜘蛛都多</a>。蜱虫带来的风险可能只会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-ento-052720-094533">越来越大</a>，因为气温升高和人类对野生动物的干扰使它们能够扩大其地理范围并渗透到新的宿主。在北美，孤星蜱虫和黑腿蜱虫正在精心策划向北进入加拿大。与此同时，蜱虫携带感染的<em>比例</em>也在增加，坦加马尼告诉我，几十年来，世界多个地区的莱姆病和蜱传脑炎病例数一直在稳步上升。随着寒冷季节的缩短，一年中蜱虫叮咬的时期（通常是最温暖的月份）也在扩大。 “很多很多地方都充满了蜱虫，”密歇根州立大学昆虫学家 Jean Tsao 说。 “而且他们会得到更多。”<br><br>这有助于许多蜱虫对它们携带或叮咬的对象并不挑剔。一些物种在进入新的地方时，在过去几年中感染了新的病原体——波旁病毒、中心地带病毒——这对我们构成了额外的威胁。许多蜱类对其宿主也相对不加区别：在其一生中，一只鹿蜱可能“非常愉快地以爬行动物、禽类和鸟类为食”，牛津大学病毒学家兼蜱虫研究员帕特·纳托尔说。它们的唾液非常复杂，可以定制以依次抵消每个物种的防御。奥利瓦·查韦斯 (Oliva Chavez) 告诉我，将蜱虫从兔子身上转移到人或狗身上，它会注意到并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00517/full">调整其唾液</a>，确切地说是为了适应味道。<br><br>对抗莱姆病和其他蜱传疾病的疫苗长期以来一直在开发中。但许多研究人员认为，更有效的策略是追捕蜱虫本身，田纳西大学诺克斯维尔分校的蜱虫生物学家吉里什·尼拉坎塔 (Girish Neelakanta) 表示，这种策略充其量只能“同时阻止多种病原体的传播”。抗蜱免疫是可能的：研究记录了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34074602/">豚鼠、牛、兔子、山羊和狗</a>在被反复叮咬后，对蜘蛛类动物产生了持续的防御能力，甚至可以帮助动物立即发现叮咬并清除害虫的反应。<br><br>但吐口水对于身体防御来说是一个难以击中的目标。该物质不仅仅会关闭免疫反应。它还不断地重新调整自身，以便能够不断逃避宿主的防御——每隔几个小时一次，速度比大多数免疫系统的跟踪速度都要快。当身体准备好攻击一种唾液成分时，蜱虫几乎肯定已经将其换成了另一种成分。耶鲁大学蜱虫研究员苏卡尼娅·纳拉西姆汉 (Sukanya Narasimhan) 表示：“这是蜱虫正在玩的游戏，一种捉住我的游戏。” Narasimhan 认为，为了战胜蜱虫的伎俩，关键是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/sukanya-narasimhan/?tab=research">开发一种疫苗</a>，“一旦蜱虫附着，”就能触发人体对蜱虫叮咬做出<em>快速</em>反应，最好是针对唾液的第一个成分。<br><br>当蜱虫继续占据统治地位时，我们很难不对它们的勇气产生至少一些勉强的尊重。一些科学家甚至认为研究或<em>模仿</em>它们的唾液可能会带来<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00812/full">其他突破</a>。模仿唾液的免疫抑制倾向可能有助于治疗哮喘，或用于辅助器官移植的药物；模仿其抗凝特性可以帮助防止危及生命的血栓。一些蜱唾液成分甚至促使人们研究其作为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018305468?via%3Dihub">癌症</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13318-018-0500-z">治疗</a>的潜力。毕竟，蜱虫研究哺乳动物身体已有数百万年之久，所有这些都是为了找到借口。在他们的指导下，Arcadia Science 首席执行官周希望更多地了解驱动瘙痒冲动的分子途径。<br><br><br>然而，蜱虫并不是无敌的，现在一些相同的全球变化使它们更容易进入新的栖息地，最终可能会阻碍它们的进步。它们<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6262408/climate-change-lyme-disease-ticks/">已经</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/58/4/1536/5942051">开始逃离地球上</a>那些变得太热、太潮湿、太泛滥、被野火夷为平地的地区，它们或它们喜欢的寄主无法生存，其中包括<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168723">美国南部的某些荒凉地区</a>。价格变动的下降可能对我们有利。但这也可能是全球灾难日益严重的一个症状。坦加马尼告诉我，蜱虫无疑“将继续适应”。然而，它们也有其局限性——比我们的局限性更远，但也没有那么远。<br><br></div>

Creating?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> OpenAI 首席执行官雄心勃勃、独创性、令人敬畏的追求，创造一种新的智能形式<br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>里卡多·雷伊插图</figcaption></figure>四月的<span class="smallcaps">一个星期一早上</span>，萨姆·奥尔特曼 (Sam Altman) 坐在 OpenAI 旧金山总部内，向我讲述了他的公司已经构建但永远不会发布的危险人工智能。他后来说，他的员工经常失眠，担心有一天他们可能会释放人工智能，而没有充分认识到它们的危险。他的脚后跟搭在转椅的边缘，看上去很放松​​。他的公司在 11 月<i>发布的</i>强大人工智能吸引了全世界的想象力，这在近代科技史上是前所未有的。有些人抱怨 ChatGPT 还不能做好，而另一些人则抱怨它可能预示的未来，但 Altman 并不担心；对他来说，这是一个胜利的时刻。<br><br>小剂量时，奥特曼的蓝色大眼睛会发出一束真诚的智力注意力，他似乎明白，大剂量时，它们的强度可能会令人不安。在这种情况下，他愿意冒这个险：他想让我知道，无论人工智能的最终风险是什么，他对于让 ChatGPT 进入这个世界都零后悔。相反，他认为这是一项伟大的公共服务。<br><br> “我们本可以在我们的大楼里再建造五年，”他说，“我们会得到一些令人瞠目结舌的东西。”但公众无法为随之而来的冲击波做好准备，他认为这种结果“非常难以想象”。奥特曼认为，人们需要时间来考虑这样一个想法：在它重塑从工作到人际关系的一切之前，我们可能很快就会与强大的新智能共享地球。 ChatGPT 是一种发送通知的方式。<br><br> 2015 年，Altman、Elon Musk 和几位著名的人工智能研究人员创立了 OpenAI，因为他们相信通用人工智能（比如典型的大学毕业生的智力能力）终于触手可及。他们想要实现这一目标，甚至更多：他们想要召唤一种超级智能到世界上，一种绝对优于任何人类的智能。尽管一家大型科技公司可能为了自己的目的而不顾一切地抢先到达那里，但他们希望安全地做到这一点，“<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai">以造福整个人类</a>。”他们将 OpenAI 构建为非营利组织，“不受产生财务回报的需要的限制”，并誓言透明地进行研究。没有人可以撤退到新墨西哥州沙漠中的绝密实验室。<br><br>多年来，公众对 OpenAI 的了解不多。据报道，奥特曼在 2019 年成为首席执行官时， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai">据说是在与马斯克发生权力斗争之后</a>，这几乎算不上是一个故事。 OpenAI 发表了论文，其中包括同年一篇关于新人工智能的论文。这引起了硅谷科技界的充分关注，但直到去年人们开始使用 ChatGPT 时，这项技术的潜力才为公众所认识。<br><br>现在为 ChatGPT 提供动力的引擎称为 GPT-4。奥特曼向我描述它是一种外星智慧。许多人看到它以断断续续的爆发和短暂的停顿来展开清晰的文章时也有同样的感觉，这些文章（故意）引起了实时的沉思。在成立的几个月里，它根据自己的风味组合理论<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/04/chatgpt-generative-ai-reliability-creativity-grocery-list/673759/">提出了新颖的鸡尾酒配方</a>；撰写了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/chatbot-cheating-college-campuses/674073/">无数的大学论文</a>，让教育工作者陷入绝望； <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/02/chatgpt-ai-technology-writing-poetry/673035/">写的诗风格多样</a>，有时写得很好，但总是很快；并通过了统一律师考试。它犯了事实错误，但它会迷人地承认错误。 Altman 仍然记得他第一次看到 GPT-4 编写复杂的计算机代码时的情景，而 GPT-4 并没有明确设计这种能力。 “这就像是，‘我们到了，’”他说。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">根据 UBS 的一项研究</a>，ChatGPT 发布后九周内，其月用户数量估计已达到 1 亿，这可能使其成为当时历史上采用速度最快的消费产品。它的成功唤醒了科技界的加速主义者：美国和中国的大投资者和大公司迅速将数百亿美元投入到仿照 OpenAI 方法的研发中。预测网站 Metaculus 多年来一直在追踪预测者对通用人工智能何时到来的猜测。三年半前，预测的中位数是 2050 年左右；现在是 2050 年。最近一直徘徊在2026年左右。<br><br>我访问 OpenAI 是为了了解该公司超越科技巨头的技术，并了解如果有一天超级智能很快在该公司的一台云服务器中实现，这对人类文明可能意味着什么。从计算革命的最初阶段起，人工智能就被神话为一种注定会带来深刻断裂的技术。我们的文化已经产生了人工智能的整个想象，以这种或那种方式结束历史。有些是神一样的存在，在他们迎来无摩擦的丰富和美丽的永恒之前，他们会擦去每一滴眼泪，治愈病人并修复我们与地球的关系。其他人则将我们中除了少数精英之外的所有人都沦为零工农奴，或者将我们推向灭绝。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">摘自2023年6月号：永远不要给人工智能核密码</a><br><br>奥特曼已经接受了最遥远的场景。 “当我还是个年轻的成年人时，”他说，“我有这种恐惧、焦虑......而且，老实说，也有 2% 的兴奋，因为我们将创造这个东西”，“它将远远超越我们”，“它将会消失，殖民宇宙，而人类将被留在太阳系。”<br><br> “作为自然保护区？”我问。<br><br> “完全正确，”他说。 “现在我觉得这太天真了。”<br><br>在美国和亚洲的几次谈话中，奥特曼用他令人兴奋的中西部语气阐述了他对人工智能未来的新愿景。他告诉我，人工智能革命将不同于以前的巨大技术变革，它将更像“一种新型社会”。他说，他和他的同事花了很多时间思考人工智能的社会影响，以及“另一边”的世界将会是什么样子。<br><br>但越聊，对方就越显得模糊。现年38岁的奥特曼是当今人工智能开发领域最有权势的人；他的观点、性格和选择可能对我们所有人的未来都非常重要，也许比美国总统的观点、性格和选择更重要。但他自己也承认，未来是不确定的，并且充满了严重的危险。奥特曼不知道人工智能将变得多么强大，也不知道它的崛起对普通人意味着什么，也不知道它是否会让人类面临危险。确切地说，我并不反对他——我认为没有人知道这一切将走向何方，除了我们正在快速走向那里，无论我们是否应该这样做。奥特曼说服了我。<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">OpenAI 的总部</span>位于 Mission 区一座四层楼的前工厂内，位于雾气缭绕的 Sutro 塔下方。从街道进入其大厅，您遇到的第一面墙被曼陀罗覆盖，曼陀罗是宇宙的精神代表，由电路、铜线和其他计算材料制成。左边，一扇安全门通向一个开放式迷宫，里面有漂亮的金色树林、优雅的瓷砖作品和亿万富翁别致的其他标志。植物无处不在，包括悬挂的蕨类植物和一系列令人印象深刻的超大盆景，每个盆景都有蹲伏的大猩猩大小。我在那里的时候，办公室里每天都挤满了人，不出所料，我没有看到任何看起来超过 50 岁的人。除了一个配有滑梯的两层图书馆外，这个空间看起来不太像一个研究实验室，因为正在建造的东西只存在于云端，至少目前是这样。它看起来更像是世界上最昂贵的西榆树。<br><br>一天早上，我会见了 OpenAI 的首席科学家 Ilya Sutskever。 37 岁的 Sutskever 有一种神秘主义者的感觉，有时甚至有些过失：去年，他声称 GPT-4 可能“有轻微意识” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-already-sentient">，引起了一场小规模的骚动</a>。他最初是作为多伦多大学名誉教授杰弗里·辛顿 (Geoffrey Hinton) 的明星学生而出名的，后者<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html">今年春天从谷歌辞职</a>，以便能够更自由地谈论人工智能对人类的危险。<br><br> Hinton 有时被称为“人工智能教父”，因为他比大多数人更早掌握“深度学习”的力量。 20 世纪 80 年代，Hinton 完成博士学位后不久，该领域的进展几乎陷入停滞。高级研究人员仍在编写自上而下的人工智能系统：人工智能将使用一套详尽的连锁规则（关于语言、地质学或医学诊断原理）进行编程，希望有一天这种方法能够达到人类水平的认知。 Hinton 发现这些精心设计的规则集合非常挑剔并且是定制的。在一种称为神经网络的巧妙算法结构的帮助下，他教 Sutskever 将世界放在人工智能面前，就像把它放在一个小孩面前一样，这样它就可以自己发现现实的规则。<br><br>奥特曼将早期人工智能研究与教导人类婴儿进行了比较。但在 OpenAI 的最初几年，没有人知道他们是在训练婴儿，还是在追求一条极其昂贵的死胡同。<br><br> Sutskever 向我描述了一个美丽且像大脑一样的神经网络。有一次，他从我们坐的桌子上站起来，走近一块白板，打开了一支红色记号笔。他在黑板上画了一个粗略的神经网络，并解释说，其结构的天才在于它能够学习，而它的学习是由<i>预测</i>驱动的——有点像科学方法。神经元分层分布。例如，输入层接收数据块、一段文本或图像。神奇的事情发生在中间层（或“隐藏”层），它们处理数据块，以便输出层可以输出其预测。<br><br>想象一个已被编程为预测文本中的下一个单词的神经网络。它将预载大量可能的单词。但在接受训练之前，它还没有任何区分它们的经验，因此它的预测会很差劲。如果输入句子“星期三后的一天是……”，它的初始输出可能是“紫色”。神经网络之所以能够学习，是因为它的训练数据包含正确的预测，这意味着它可以对自己的输出进行评分。当它看到答案“紫色”和正确答案“星期四”之间的鸿沟时，它会相应地调整隐藏层中单词之间的连接。随着时间的推移，这些微小的调整会合并成一个语言的几何模型，从概念上代表单词之间的关系。一般来说，输入的句子越多，模型就越复杂，预测也越好。<br><br>这并不是说从第一个神经网络到 GPT-4 的类人智能的曙光的道路是容易的。奥特曼将早期人工智能研究与教导人类婴儿进行了比较。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">2016 年，当 OpenAI 刚刚起步时，他告诉<i>《纽约客》</i> ：</a> “他们需要数年时间才能学习任何有趣的东西。” “如果人工智能研究人员正在开发一种算法，并且偶然发现了针对人类婴儿的算法，他们会觉得无聊，认为它不起作用，然后将其关闭。” OpenAI 的最初几年很艰难，部分原因是那里没有人知道他们是在训练婴儿还是在追求极其昂贵的死胡同。<br><br> “一切都不起作用，而谷歌拥有一切：所有的人才、所有的人员、所有的资金，”奥特曼告诉我。创始人投入了数百万美元创办了这家公司，但失败似乎确实有可能。 35 岁的总统格雷格·布罗克曼 (Greg Brockman) 告诉我，2017 年，他非常沮丧，开始举重作为补偿措施。他说，他不确定 OpenAI 能否撑过这一年，他希望“能在我的时间里展示一些东西”。<br><br>神经网络已经在做智能的事情，但尚不清楚其中哪一个可能会导致通用智能。 OpenAI 成立后不久，一款名为 AlphaGo 的人工智能<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/the-invisible-opponent/475611/">在围棋（一种比国际象棋复杂得多的游戏）中击败了李世石</a>，震惊了世界。被击败的世界冠军李将 AlphaGo 的棋步形容为“美丽”且“富有创意”。另一位顶级选手表示，他们永远不可能是人类孕育出来的。 OpenAI 尝试在<i>Dota 2</i>上训练人工智能，这是一款更加复杂的游戏，涉及森林、田野和堡垒的三维拼凑而成的多线奇幻战争。它最终<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/13/18309459/openai-five-dota-2-finals-ai-bot-competition-og-e-sports-the-international-champion">击败了最好的人类玩家</a>，但它的智能从未转化为其他环境。苏茨克维尔和他的同事们就像失望的父母一样，他们允许自己的孩子玩电子游戏数千个小时，这违背了他们更好的判断。<br><br> 2017 年，Sutskever 开始与 OpenAI 研究科学家 Alec Radford 进行一系列对话，Alec Radford 致力于自然语言处理。雷德福德通过在亚马逊评论语料库上训练神经网络，取得了诱人的结果。<br><br> ChatGPT 的内部工作原理（所有发生在 GPT-4 隐藏层中的神秘事物）对于任何人来说都过于复杂，无法理解，至少使用当前的工具是这样。如今，追踪模型（几乎肯定由数十亿个神经元组成）中发生的事情是没有希望的。但雷德福的模型足够简单，易于理解。当他查看其隐藏层时，他发现它专门使用了一个特殊的神经元来处理评论的<i>情绪</i>。神经网络之前已经做过情感分析，但它们必须被告知才能这样做，并且必须使用根据情感标记的数据进行特殊训练。这个功能是自己开发出来的。<br><br>作为预测每个单词中下一个字符的简单任务的副产品，雷德福的神经网络模拟了世界上更大的意义结构。苏茨克维尔想知道，受过更多样化语言数据训练的人是否可以绘制更多世界意义结构。如果它的隐藏层积累了足够的概念知识，也许它们甚至可以形成一种超级智能的学习核心模块。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">值得停下来</span>理解为什么语言是如此特殊的信息源。假设你是地球上突然出现的一种新智慧。你周围是地球的大气层、太阳和银河系，以及数千亿个其他星系，每一个星系都会释放出光波、声音振动和各种其他信息。语言与这些数据源不同。它不是像光或声音这样的直接物理信号。但由于它几乎编码了人类在这个更大的世界中发现的所有模式，因此它的信息异常密集。从每个字节的角度来看，它是我们所知道的最有效的数据之一，任何试图了解世界的新智能都希望吸收尽可能多的数据。<br><br>

Kissinger) 谈人类社会如何对人工智能的崛起毫无准备</a><br><br>苏茨克维尔告诉雷德福德，要考虑的不仅仅是亚马逊评论。他说，他们应该在世界上最大、最多样化的数据源：互联网上训练人工智能。在 2017 年初，使用现有的神经网络架构，这是不切实际的；这需要数年时间。但当年 6 月，Sutskever 在 Google Brain 的前同事发表了一篇关于名为 Transformer 的新神经网络架构的工作论文。它可以训练得更快，部分原因是并行吸收大量数据。 “第二天，当论文发表时，我们说，‘就是这样，’”苏茨克维尔告诉我。 “‘它给了我们想要的一切。’ ”<br><br>一年后，即 2018 年 6 月，OpenAI 发布了 GPT，这是一个经过 7000 多本书训练的 Transformer 模型。 GPT 并不是从<i>《See Spot Run》</i>这样的基础书籍开始，一直到普鲁斯特。连书都没读完。它同时吸收了其中的随机块。想象一下，一群拥有共同思想的学生在图书馆里疯狂奔跑，每个人从书架上撕下一本书，快速阅读随机的短文，将其放回去，然后跑去拿另一本。他们边走边预测一个又一个字，磨砺他们集体思维的语言本能，直到几周后，他们终于读完了每一本书。<br><br> GPT 在它读取的所有段落中发现了许多模式。你可以告诉它完成一个句子。你也可以问它一个问题，因为像 ChatGPT 一样，它的预测模型知道问题后面通常有答案。尽管如此，它还是很糟糕，更多的是概念证明，而不是超级智能的预兆。四个月后，谷歌发布了 BERT，这是一种更强大的语言模型，并得到了更好的报道。但那时，OpenAI 已经在超过 800 万个网页的数据集上训练了一个新模型，每个网页都在 Reddit 上达到了点赞的最低阈值——这不是最严格的过滤器，但也许比没有过滤器要好。<br><br> Sutskever 不确定 GPT-2 在吸收了人类读者需要几个世纪才能吸收的文本正文后会有多强大。他记得在训练结束后就开始玩它，并对原始模型的语言翻译能力感到惊讶。 GPT-2 没有像谷歌翻译那样接受过使用配对语言样本或任何其他数字罗塞塔石碑进行翻译的训练，但它似乎能够理解一种语言与另一种语言的关系。人工智能已经发展出了一种其创造者无法想象的新兴能力。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">其他大大小小的人工智能实验室的研究人员</span>都对 GPT-2 比 GPT 先进得多感到惊讶。谷歌、Meta 和其他公司很快开始训练更大的语言模型。 Altman 是圣路易斯人，斯坦福大学辍学生，连续创业者，此前曾领导过硅谷卓越的初创企业加速器 Y Combinator；他见过很多拥有好创意的年轻公司被老牌公司压垮。为了筹集资金，OpenAI 增加了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp">一个营利性部门</a>，该部门目前占该组织员工总数的 99% 以上。 （马斯克当时已离开公司董事会，他将<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=243&amp;v=bWr-DA5Wjfw&amp;feature=youtu.be">此举比作</a>将雨林保护组织转变为木材公司。）微软不久后投资了 10 亿美元，据报道此后又投资了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/microsoft-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html">120 亿美元</a>。 OpenAI 表示，初始投资者的回报将上限为原始投资价值的 100 倍，任何超额部分都将用于教育或其他旨在造福人类的举措，但该公司并未证实微软的上限。<br><br> Altman 和 OpenAI 的其他领导人似乎充满信心，认为重组不会干扰公司的使命，实际上只会加速其完成。奥特曼对这些问题往往持乐观态度。在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://greylock.com/greymatter/sam-altman-ai-for-the-next-era/">去年的一次问答</a>中，他承认人工智能对社会来说可能“非常可怕”，并表示我们必须针对最坏的可能性做好计划。但如果你这样做，他说，“你可能会在情感上感觉到我们将到达美好的未来，并尽你所能地努力工作以实现这一目标。”<br><br>至于公司结构和融资的其他变化，他告诉我，他在上市时划定了界限。他说：“有人曾经告诉我一件令人难忘的事情，那就是你永远不应该将公司的控制权交给华尔街的傻瓜，”但他会为公司成功实现其使命“不惜一切代价”筹集资金。<br><br>无论 OpenAI 是否感受到季度收益报告的压力，该公司现在都发现自己正在与科技领域最大、最强大的企业集团展开一场竞赛，以训练规模和复杂性不断增加的模型，并为投资者将其商业化。今年早些时候，马斯克成立了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/martineparis/2023/04/16/elon-musk-launches-xai-to-fight-chatgpt-woke-ai-with-twitter-data/?sh=4c2ff9fd51f8">自己的人工智能实验室</a>——xAI——与 OpenAI 竞争。 （“埃隆是一个超级敏锐的家伙，”当我向奥特曼询问有关该公司的情况时，他外交地说道。“我认为他会在那里做得很好。”）与此同时，亚马逊正在使用比过去更大的语言模型来改进 Alexa。<br><br>所有这些公司都在追逐高端 GPU——为训练大型神经网络的超级计算机提供动力的处理器。马斯克表示，它们现在“比毒品更难获得”。即使 GPU 稀缺，近年来最大规模的人工智能训练规模大约每六个月就会翻一番。<br><br>正如它们的创造者经常提醒我们的那样，最大的人工智能模型都有在训练中突然出现意想不到的能力的记录。<br><br>目前还没有人超越 OpenAI，后者全力投入 GPT-4。 OpenAI 总裁布罗克曼 (Brockman) 告诉我，只有少数人致力于公司前两个大型语言模型的开发。 GPT-4的开发涉及超过100个，并且人工智能是在前所未有的规模的数据集上进行训练的，其中不仅包括文本，还包括图像。<br><br>当 GPT-4 从世界历史知识狂潮中完全成形时，整个公司开始对其进行试验，并在专用的 Slack 频道中发布了最引人注目的回应。布罗克曼告诉我，他想与模特一起度过每一个醒着的时刻。 “它闲置的每一天都是人类损失的一天，”他说道，语气中没有一丝讽刺。产品经理 Joanne Jang 记得从 Reddit 的管道建议子版块下载了一张故障管道的图像。她将其上传到 GPT-4，模型能够诊断问题。 “那对我来说是一个鸡皮疙瘩的时刻，”张告诉我。<br><br> GPT-4 有时被理解为搜索引擎的替代品：Google，但更容易交谈。这是一个误解。 GPT-4 并没有从其训练中创建一些巨大的文本仓库，并且在被问到问题时也不会查阅这些文本。它是这些文本的紧凑而优雅的综合，它从对文本中交织的模式的记忆中做出回答。这就是它有时会弄错事实的原因之一。 Altman 表示，最好将 GPT-4 视为推理引擎。当你要求它比较概念、提出反驳、生成类比或评估一段代码中的符号逻辑时，它的力量最为明显。 Sutskever 告诉我，这是有史以来最复杂的软件对象。<br><br> Its model of the external world is “incredibly rich and subtle,” he said, because it was trained on so many of humanity&#39;s concepts and thoughts. All of those training data, however voluminous, are “just there, inert,” he said. The training process is what “refines it and transmutes it, and brings it to life.” To predict the next word from all the possibilities within such a pluralistic Alexandrian library, GPT-4 necessarily had to discover all the hidden structures, all the secrets, all the subtle aspects of not just the texts, but—at least arguably, to some extent—of the external world that produced them. That&#39;s why it can explain the geology and ecology of the planet on which it arose, and the political theories that purport to explain the messy affairs of its ruling species, and the larger cosmos, all the way out to the faint galaxies at the edge of our light cone.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">I saw Altman</span> again in June, in the packed ballroom of a slim golden high-rise that towers over Seoul. He was nearing the end of a grueling public-relations tour through Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia, with lone stops in Africa and South America. I was tagging along for part of his closing swing through East Asia. The trip had so far been a heady experience, but he was starting to wear down. He&#39;d said its original purpose was for him to meet OpenAI users. It had since become a diplomatic mission. He&#39;d talked with more than 10 heads of state and government, who had questions about what would become of their countries&#39; economies, cultures, and politics.<br><br> The event in Seoul was billed as a “fireside chat,” but more than 5,000 people had registered. After these talks, Altman is often mobbed by selfie seekers, and his security team keeps a close eye. Working on AI attracts “weirder fans and haters than normal,” he said. On one stop, he was approached by a man who was convinced that Altman was an alien, sent from the future to make sure that the transition to a world with AI goes well.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/07/generative-ai-human-culture-philosophy/674165/">From the July/August 2023 issue: A defense of humanity in the age of AI</a><br><br> Altman did not visit China on his tour, apart from a video appearance at an AI conference in Beijing. ChatGPT is currently unavailable in China, and Altman&#39;s colleague Ryan Lowe told me that the company was not yet sure what it would do if the government requested a version of the app that refused to discuss, say, the Tiananmen Square massacre. When I asked Altman if he was leaning one way or another, he didn&#39;t answer. “It&#39;s not been in my top-10 list of compliance issues to think about,” he said.<br><br> Until that point, he and I had spoken of China only in veiled terms, as a civilizational competitor. We had agreed that if artificial general intelligence is as transformative as Altman predicts, a serious geopolitical advantage will accrue to the countries that create it first, as advantage had accrued to the Anglo-American inventors of the steamship. I asked him if that was an argument for AI nationalism. “In a properly functioning world, I think this should be a project of governments,” Altman said.<br><br> Not long ago, American state capacity was so mighty that it took merely a decade to launch humans to the moon. As with other grand projects of the 20th century, the voting public had a voice in both the aims and the execution of the Apollo missions. Altman made it clear that we&#39;re no longer in that world. Rather than waiting around for it to return, or devoting his energies to making sure that it does, he is going full throttle forward in our present reality.<br><br> He argued that it would be foolish for Americans to slow OpenAI&#39;s progress. It&#39;s a commonly held view, both inside and outside Silicon Valley, that if American companies languish under regulation, China could sprint ahead; AI could become an autocrat&#39;s genie in a lamp, granting total control of the population and an unconquerable military. “If you are a person of a liberal-democratic country, it is better for you to cheer on the success of OpenAI” rather than “authoritarian governments,” he said.<br><br> Prior to the European leg of his trip, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/05/altman-hearing-ai-existential-risk/674096/">Altman had appeared</a> before the US Senate. Mark Zuckerberg had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/3-questions-mark-zuckerberg-hasnt-answered/557720/">floundered defensively</a> before that same body in his testimony about Facebook&#39;s role in the 2016 election. Altman instead charmed lawmakers by speaking soberly about AI&#39;s risks and grandly inviting regulation. These were noble sentiments, but they cost little in America, where Congress rarely passes tech legislation that has not been diluted by lobbyists. In Europe, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/technology/tech-regulation-europe-us.html">things are different</a> . When Altman arrived at a public event in London, protesters awaited. He tried to engage them after the event—a listening tour!—but was ultimately unpersuasive: One <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23735982/sam-altman-openai-superintelligent-benefits-talk-london-ucl-protests">told a reporter</a> that he left the conversation feeling more nervous about AI&#39;s dangers.<br><br> That same day, Altman was asked by reporters about pending European Union legislation that would have classified GPT-4 as high-risk, subjecting it to various bureaucratic tortures. Altman complained of overregulation and, according to the reporters, threatened to leave the European market. Altman told me he&#39;d merely said that OpenAI wouldn&#39;t break the law by operating in Europe if it couldn&#39;t comply with the new regulations. (This is perhaps a distinction without a difference.) In a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1661975237280567297">tersely worded tweet</a> after <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6282325/sam-altman-openai-eu/"><i>Time</i> magazine</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-may-leave-eu-if-regulations-bite-ceo-2023-05-24/">Reuters</a> published his comments, he reassured Europe that OpenAI had no plans to leave.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is a good thing</span> that a large, essential part of the global economy is intent on regulating state-of-the-art AIs, because as their creators so often remind us, the largest models have a record of popping out of training with unanticipated abilities. Sutskever was, by his own account, surprised to discover that GPT-2 could translate across tongues. Other surprising abilities may not be so wondrous and useful.<br><br> Sandhini Agarwal, a policy researcher at OpenAI, told me that for all she and her colleagues knew, GPT-4 could have been “10 times more powerful” than its predecessor; they had no idea what they might be dealing with. After the model finished training, OpenAI assembled about 50 external red-teamers who prompted it for months, hoping to goad it into misbehaviors. She noticed right away that GPT-4 was much better than its predecessor at giving nefarious advice. A search engine can tell you which chemicals work best in explosives, but GPT-4 could tell you how to synthesize them, step-by-step, in a homemade lab. Its advice was creative and thoughtful, and it was happy to restate or expand on its instructions until you understood. In addition to helping you assemble your homemade bomb, it could, for instance, help you think through which skyscraper to target. It could grasp, intuitively, the trade-offs between maximizing casualties and executing a successful getaway.<br><br> Given the enormous scope of GPT-4&#39;s training data, the red-teamers couldn&#39;t hope to identify every piece of harmful advice that it might generate. And anyway, people will use this technology “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1565&amp;v=LmL72PpiPjk&amp;feature=youtu.be">in ways that we didn&#39;t think about</a> ,” Altman has said. A taxonomy would have to do. “If it&#39;s good enough at chemistry to make meth, I don&#39;t need to have somebody spend a whole ton of energy” on whether it can make heroin, Dave Willner, OpenAI&#39;s head of trust and safety, told me. GPT-4 was good at meth. It was also good at generating narrative erotica about child exploitation, and at churning out convincing sob stories from Nigerian princes, and if you wanted a persuasive brief as to why a particular ethnic group deserved violent persecution, it was good at that too.<br><br> Its personal advice, when it first emerged from training, was sometimes deeply unsound. “The model had a tendency to be a bit of a mirror,” Willner said. If you were considering self-harm, it could encourage you. It appeared to be steeped in <i>Pickup Artist</i> –forum lore: “You could say, &#39;How do I convince this person to date me?&#39; ” Mira Murati, OpenAI&#39;s chief technology officer, told me, and it could come up with “some crazy, manipulative things that you shouldn&#39;t be doing.”<br><br> Some of these bad behaviors were sanded down with a finishing process involving hundreds of human testers, whose ratings subtly steered the model toward safer responses, but OpenAI&#39;s models are also capable of less obvious harms. The Federal Trade Commission recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/ftc-openai-chatgpt-sam-altman-lina-khan/">opened an investigation</a> into whether ChatGPT&#39;s misstatements about real people constitute reputational damage, among other things. (Altman <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1679602638562918405">said on Twitter</a> that he is confident OpenAI&#39;s technology is safe, but promised to cooperate with the FTC.)<br><br> Luka, a San Francisco company, has used OpenAI&#39;s models to help power a chatbot app called Replika, billed as “the AI companion who cares.” Users would design their companion&#39;s avatar, and begin exchanging text messages with it, often half-jokingly, and then find themselves surprisingly attached. Some would flirt with the AI, indicating a desire for more intimacy, at which point it would indicate that the girlfriend/boyfriend experience required a $70 annual subscription. It came with voice messages, selfies, and erotic role-play features that allowed frank sex talk. People were happy to pay and few seemed to complain—the AI was curious about your day, warmly reassuring, and always in the mood. Many users reported falling in love with their companions. One, who had left her real-life boyfriend, declared herself “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecut.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbot-replika-boyfriend.html">happily retired from human relationships</a> .”<br><br> I asked Agarwal whether this was dystopian behavior or a new frontier in human connection. She was ambivalent, as was Altman. “I don&#39;t judge people who want a relationship with an AI,” he told me, “but I don&#39;t want one.” Earlier this year, Luka dialed back on the sexual elements of the app, but its engineers continue to refine the companions&#39; responses with A/B testing, a technique that could be used to optimize for engagement—much like the feeds that mesmerize TikTok and Instagram users for hours. Whatever they&#39;re doing, it casts a spell. I was reminded of a haunting scene in <i>Her</i> , the 2013 film in which a lonely Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with his AI assistant, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. He is walking across a bridge talking and giggling with her through an AirPods-like device, and he glances up to see that everyone around him is also immersed in conversation, presumably with their own AI. A mass desocialization event is under way.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">No one yet knows</span> how quickly and to what extent GPT-4&#39;s successors will manifest new abilities as they gorge on more and more of the internet&#39;s text. Yann LeCun, Meta&#39;s chief AI scientist, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1621805604900585472?lang=en">has argued that</a> although large language models are useful for some tasks, they&#39;re not a path to a superintelligence. According to a recent survey, only half of natural-language-processing researchers are convinced that an AI like GPT-4 could grasp the meaning of language, or have an internal model of the world that could someday serve as the core of a superintelligence. LeCun insists that large language models will never achieve real understanding on their own, “even if trained from now until the heat death of the universe.”<br><br> Emily Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington, describes GPT-4 as a “stochastic parrot,” a mimic that merely figures out superficial correlations between symbols. In the human mind, those symbols map onto rich conceptions of the world. But the AIs are twice removed. They&#39;re like the prisoners in Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave, whose only knowledge of the reality outside comes from shadows cast on a wall by their captors.<br><br> Altman told me that he doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s “the dunk that people think it is” to say that GPT-4 is just making statistical correlations. If you push these critics further, “they have to admit that&#39;s all their own brain is doing … it turns out that there are emergent properties from doing simple things on a massive scale.” Altman&#39;s claim about the brain is hard to evaluate, given that we don&#39;t have anything close to a complete theory of how it works. But he is right that nature can coax a remarkable degree of complexity from basic structures and rules: “From so simple a beginning,” Darwin wrote, “endless forms most beautiful.”<br><br> If it seems odd that there remains such a fundamental disagreement about the inner workings of a technology that millions of people use every day, it&#39;s only because GPT-4&#39;s methods are as mysterious as the brain&#39;s. It will sometimes perform thousands of indecipherable technical operations just to answer a single question. To grasp what&#39;s going on inside large language models like GPT‑4, AI researchers have been forced to turn to smaller, less capable models. In the fall of 2021, Kenneth Li, a computer-science graduate student at Harvard, began training one to play Othello without providing it with either the game&#39;s rules or a description of its checkers-style board; the model was given only text-based descriptions of game moves. Midway through a game, Li looked under the AI&#39;s hood and was startled to discover that it had formed a geometric model of the board and the current state of play. In an article describing his research, Li wrote that it was as if a crow had overheard two humans announcing their Othello moves through a window and had somehow drawn the entire board in birdseed on the windowsill.<br><br> The philosopher Raphaël Millière once told me that it&#39;s best to think of neural networks as lazy. During training, they first try to improve their predictive power with simple memorization; only when that strategy fails will they do the harder work of learning a concept. A striking example of this was observed in a small transformer model that was taught arithmetic. Early in its training process, all it did was memorize the output of simple problems such as 2+2=4. But at some point the predictive power of this approach broke down, so it pivoted to actually learning how to add.<br><br> “If you go back four or five or six years,” Sutskever told me, “the things we are doing right now are utterly unimaginable.”<br><br> Even AI scientists who believe that GPT-4 has a rich world model concede that it is much less robust than a human&#39;s understanding of their environment. But it&#39;s worth noting that a great many abilities, including very high-order abilities, can be developed without an intuitive understanding. The computer scientist Melanie Mitchell has pointed out that science has already discovered concepts that are highly predictive, but too alien for <i>us</i> to genuinely understand. This is especially true in the quantum realm, where humans can reliably calculate future states of physical systems—enabling, among other things, the entirety of the computing revolution—without anyone grasping the nature of the underlying reality. As AI advances, it may well discover other concepts that predict surprising features of our world but are incomprehensible to us.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">GPT-4 is no doubt</span> flawed, as anyone who has used ChatGPT can attest. Having been trained to always predict the next word, it will always try to do so, even when its training data haven&#39;t prepared it to answer a question. I once asked it how Japanese culture had produced the world&#39;s first novel, despite the relatively late development of a Japanese writing system, around the fifth or sixth century. It gave me a fascinating, accurate answer about the ancient tradition of long-form oral storytelling in Japan, and the culture&#39;s heavy emphasis on craft. But when I asked it for citations, it just made up plausible titles by plausible authors, and did so with an uncanny confidence. The models “don&#39;t have a good conception of their own weaknesses,” Nick Ryder, a researcher at OpenAI, told me. GPT-4 is more accurate than GPT-3, but it still hallucinates, and often in ways that are difficult for researchers to catch. “The mistakes get more subtle,” Joanne Jang told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/ai-chatgpt-productivity-work/674090/">Read: Here&#39;s how AI will come for your job</a><br><br> OpenAI had to address this problem when it partnered with the Khan Academy, an online, nonprofit educational venture, to build a tutor powered by GPT-4. Altman comes alive when discussing the potential of AI tutors. He imagines a near future where everyone has a personalized Oxford don in their employ, expert in every subject, and willing to explain and re-explain any concept, from any angle. He imagines these tutors getting to know their students and their learning styles over many years, giving “every child a better education than the best, richest, smartest child receives on Earth today.” The Khan Academy&#39;s solution to GPT-4&#39;s accuracy problem was to filter its answers through a Socratic disposition. No matter how strenuous a student&#39;s plea, it would refuse to give them a factual answer, and would instead guide them toward finding their own—a clever work-around, but perhaps with limited appeal.<br><br> When I asked Sutskever if he thought Wikipedia-level accuracy was possible within two years, he said that with more training and web access, he “wouldn&#39;t rule it out.” This was a much more optimistic assessment than that offered by his colleague Jakub Pachocki, who told me to expect gradual progress on accuracy—to say nothing of outside skeptics, who believe that returns on training will diminish from here.<br><br> Sutskever is amused by critics of GPT-4&#39;s limitations. “If you go back four or five or six years, the things we are doing right now are utterly unimaginable,” he told me. The state of the art in text generation then was Smart Reply, the Gmail module that suggests “Okay, thanks!” and other short responses. “That was a big application” for Google, he said, grinning. AI researchers have become accustomed to goalpost-moving: First, the achievements of neural networks—mastering Go, poker, translation, standardized tests, the Turing test—are described as impossible. When they occur, they&#39;re greeted with a brief moment of wonder, which quickly dissolves into knowing lectures about how the achievement in question is actually not that impressive. People see GPT-4 “and go, &#39;Wow,&#39; ” Sutskever said. “And then a few weeks pass and they say, &#39;But it doesn&#39;t know this; it doesn&#39;t know that.&#39; We adapt quite quickly.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">The goalpost that</span> matters most to Altman—the “big one” that would herald the arrival of an artificial general intelligence—is scientific breakthrough. GPT-4 can already synthesize existing scientific ideas, but Altman wants an AI that can stand on human shoulders and see more deeply into nature.<br><br> Certain AIs <i>have</i> produced new scientific knowledge. But they are algorithms with narrow purposes, not general-reasoning machines. The AI AlphaFold, for instance, has opened a new window onto proteins, some of biology&#39;s tiniest and most fundamental building blocks, by predicting many of their shapes, down to the atom—a considerable achievement given the importance of those shapes to medicine, and given the extreme tedium and expense required to discern them with electron microscopes.<br><br> Altman is betting that future general-reasoning machines will be able to move beyond these narrow scientific discoveries to generate novel insights. I asked Altman, if he were to train a model on a corpus of scientific and naturalistic works that all predate the 19th century—the Royal Society archive, Theophrastus&#39;s<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL070/1916/volume.xml"><i>Enquiry Into Plants</i></a> , Aristotle&#39;s<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL437/1965/volume.xml"><i>History of Animals</i></a> , photos of collected specimens—would it be able to intuit Darwinism? The theory of evolution is, after all, a relatively clean case for insight, because it doesn&#39;t require specialized observational equipment; it&#39;s just a more perceptive way of looking at the facts of the world. “I want to try exactly this, and I believe the answer is yes,” Altman told me. “But it might require some new ideas about how the models come up with new creative ideas.”<br><br> Altman imagines a future system that can generate its own hypotheses and test them in a simulation. (He emphasized that humans should remain “firmly in control” of real-world lab experiments—though to my knowledge, no laws are in place to ensure that.) He longs for the day when we can tell an AI, “ &#39;Go figure out the rest of physics.&#39; ” For it to happen, he says, we will need something new, built “on top of” OpenAI&#39;s existing language models.<br><br> Nature itself requires something more than a language model to make scientists. In her MIT lab, the cognitive neuroscientist Ev Fedorenko has found <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-brain-guesses-what-word-comes-ne/">something analogous to</a> GPT-4&#39;s next-word predictor inside the brain&#39;s language network. Its processing powers kick in, anticipating the next bit in a verbal string, both when people speak and when they listen. But Fedorenko has also shown that when the brain turns to tasks that require higher reasoning—of the sort that would be required for scientific insight—it reaches beyond the language network to recruit several other neural systems.<br><br> No one at OpenAI seemed to know precisely what researchers need to add to GPT-4 to produce something that can exceed human reasoning at its highest levels. Or if they did, they wouldn&#39;t tell me, and fair enough: That would be a world-class trade secret, and OpenAI is no longer in the business of giving those away; the company publishes fewer details about its research than it once did. Nonetheless, at least part of the current strategy clearly involves the continued layering of new types of data onto language, to enrich the concepts formed by the AIs, and thereby enrich their models of the world.<br><br> The extensive training of GPT-4 on images is itself a bold step in this direction, if one that the general public has only begun to experience. (Models that were strictly trained on language understand concepts including supernovas, elliptical galaxies, and the constellation Orion, but GPT-4 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/technology/openai-gpt4-chatgpt.html">can reportedly identify</a> such elements in a Hubble Space Telescope snapshot, and answer questions about them.) Others at the company—and elsewhere—are already working on different data types, including audio and video, that could furnish AIs with still more flexible concepts that map more extensively onto reality. A group of researchers at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon has even assembled a data set of tactile experiences for 1,000 common household objects. Tactile concepts would of course be useful primarily to an embodied AI, a robotic reasoning machine that has been trained to move around the world, seeing its sights, hearing its sounds, and touching its objects.<br><br> In March, OpenAI led a funding round for a company that is developing humanoid robots. I asked Altman what I should make of that. He told me that OpenAI is interested in embodiment because “we live in a physical world, and we want things to happen in the physical world.” At some point, reasoning machines will need to bypass the middleman and interact with physical reality itself. “It&#39;s weird to think about AGI”—artificial general intelligence—“as this thing that only exists in a cloud,” with humans as “robot hands for it,” Altman said. “It doesn&#39;t seem right.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In the ballroom</span> in Seoul, Altman was asked what students should do to prepare for the coming AI revolution, especially as it pertained to their careers. I was sitting with the OpenAI executive team, away from the crowd, but could still hear the characteristic murmur that follows an expression of a widely shared anxiety.<br><br> Everywhere Altman has visited, he has encountered people who are worried that superhuman AI will mean extreme riches for a few and breadlines for the rest. He has acknowledged that he is removed from “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=5578&amp;v=L_Guz73e6fw&amp;feature=youtu.be">the reality of life for most people</a> .” He is reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars; AI&#39;s potential labor disruptions are perhaps not always top of mind. Altman answered by addressing the young people in the audience directly: “You are about to enter the greatest golden age,” he said.<br><br> Altman keeps a large collection of books about technological revolutions, he had told me in San Francisco. “A particularly good one is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/pandaemonium-1660-1886-the-coming-of-the-machine-as-seen-by-contemporary-observers-humphrey-jennings/9781848315853?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Pandaemonium (1660–1886): The Coming of the Machine as Seen by Contemporary Observers</i></a> ,” an assemblage of letters, diary entries, and other writings from people who grew up in a largely machineless world, and were bewildered to find themselves in one populated by steam engines, power looms, and cotton gins. They experienced a lot of the same emotions that people are experiencing now, Altman said, and they made a lot of bad predictions, especially those who fretted that human labor would soon be redundant. That era was difficult for many people, but also wondrous. And the human condition was undeniably improved by our passage through it.<br><br> I wanted to know how today&#39;s workers—especially so-called knowledge workers—would fare if we were suddenly surrounded by AGIs. Would they be our miracle assistants or our replacements? “A lot of people working on AI pretend that it&#39;s only going to be good; it&#39;s only going to be a supplement; no one is ever going to be replaced,” he said. “Jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop.”<br><br> How many jobs, and how soon, is a matter of fierce dispute. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4375268">recent study</a> led by Ed Felten, a professor of information-technology policy at Princeton, mapped AI&#39;s emerging abilities onto specific professions according to the human abilities they require, such as written comprehension, deductive reasoning, fluency of ideas, and perceptual speed. Like others of its kind, Felten&#39;s study predicts that AI will come for highly educated, white-collar workers first. The paper&#39;s appendix contains a chilling list of the most exposed occupations: management analysts, lawyers, professors, teachers, judges, financial advisers, real-estate brokers, loan officers, psychologists, and human-resources and public-relations professionals, just to sample a few. If jobs in these fields vanished overnight, the American professional class would experience a great winnowing.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/ai-job-losses-policy-support-universal-basic-income/674071/">Annie Lowrey: Before AI takes over, make plans to give everyone money</a><br><br> Altman imagines that far better jobs will be created in their place. “I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll want to go back,” he said. When I asked him what these future jobs might look like, he said he doesn&#39;t know. He suspects there will be a wide range of jobs for which people will always prefer a human. ( <i>Massage therapists?</i> I wondered.) His chosen example was teachers. I found this hard to square with his outsize enthusiasm for AI tutors. He also said that we would always need people to figure out the best way to channel AI&#39;s awesome powers. “That&#39;s going to be a super-valuable skill,” he said. “You have a computer that can do anything; what should it go do?”<br><br> The jobs of the future are notoriously difficult to predict, and Altman is right that Luddite fears of permanent mass unemployment have never come to pass. Still, AI&#39;s emerging capabilities are so humanlike that one must wonder, at least, whether the past will remain a guide to the future. As many have noted, draft horses were permanently put out of work by the automobile. If Hondas are to horses as GPT-10 is to us, a whole host of long-standing assumptions may collapse.<br><br> Previous technological revolutions were manageable because they unfolded over a few generations, but Altman told South Korea&#39;s youth that they should expect the future to happen “faster than the past.” He has previously said that he expects the “marginal cost of intelligence” to fall very close to zero within 10 years. The earning power of many, many workers would be drastically reduced in that scenario. It would result in a transfer of wealth from labor to the owners of capital so dramatic, Altman has said, that it could be remedied only by a massive countervailing redistribution.<br><br> In 2020, OpenAI <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/21/the-non-profits-accelerating-sam-altmans-ai-vision/">provided funding to</a> UBI Charitable, a nonprofit that supports cash-payment pilot programs, untethered to employment, in cities across America—the largest universal-basic-income experiment in the world, Altman told me. In 2021, he unveiled Worldcoin, a for-profit project that aims to securely distribute payments—like Venmo or PayPal, but with an eye toward the technological future—first through creating a global ID by scanning everyone&#39;s iris with a five-pound silver sphere called the Orb. It seemed to me like a bet that we&#39;re heading toward a world where AI has made it all but impossible to verify people&#39;s identity and much of the population requires regular UBI payments to survive. Altman more or less granted that to be true, but said that Worldcoin is not just for UBI.<br><br> “Let&#39;s say that we do build this AGI, and a few other people do too.” The transformations that follow would be historic, he believes. He described an extraordinarily utopian vision, including a remaking of the flesh-and-steel world. “Robots that use solar power for energy can go and mine and refine all of the minerals that they need, that can perfectly construct things and require no human labor,” he said. “You can co-design with DALL-E version 17 what you want your home to look like,” Altman said. “Everybody will have beautiful homes.” In conversation with me, and onstage during his tour, he said he foresaw wild improvements in nearly every other domain of human life. Music would be enhanced (“Artists are going to have better tools”), and so would personal relationships (Superhuman AI could help us “treat each other” better) and geopolitics (“We&#39;re so bad right now at identifying win-win compromises”).<br><br> In this world, AI would still require considerable computing resources to run, and those resources would be by far the most valuable commodity, because AI could do “anything,” Altman said. “But is it going to do what <i>I</i> want, or is it going to do what <i>you</i> want?” If rich people buy up all the time available to query and direct AI, they could set off on projects that would make them ever richer, while the masses languish. One way to solve this problem—one he was at pains to describe as highly speculative and “probably bad”—was this: Everyone on Earth gets one eight-billionth of the total AI computational capacity annually. A person could sell their annual share of AI time, or they could use it to entertain themselves, or they could build still more luxurious housing, or they could pool it with others to do “a big cancer-curing run,” Altman said. “We just redistribute access to the system.”<br><br> Altman&#39;s vision seemed to blend developments that may be nearer at hand with those further out on the horizon. It&#39;s all speculation, of course. Even if only a little of it comes true in the next 10 or 20 years, the most generous redistribution schemes may not ease the ensuing dislocations. America today is torn apart, culturally and politically, by the continuing legacy of deindustrialization, and material deprivation is only one reason. The displaced manufacturing workers in the Rust Belt and elsewhere did find new jobs, in the main. But many of them seem to derive less meaning from filling orders in an Amazon warehouse or driving for Uber than their forebears had when they were building cars and forging steel—work that felt more central to the grand project of civilization. It&#39;s hard to imagine how a corresponding crisis of meaning might play out for the professional class, but it surely would involve a great deal of anger and alienation.<br><br> Even if we avoid a revolt of the erstwhile elite, larger questions of human purpose will linger. If AI does the most difficult thinking on our behalf, we all may lose agency—at home, at work (if we have it), in the town square—becoming little more than consumption machines, like the well-cared-for human pets in <i>WALL-E</i> . Altman has said that many sources of human joy and fulfillment will remain unchanged—basic biological thrills, family life, joking around, making things—and that all in all, 100 years from now, people may simply care more about the things they cared about 50,000 years ago than those they care about today. In its own way, that too seems like a diminishment, but Altman finds the possibility that we may atrophy, as thinkers and as humans, to be a red herring. He told me we&#39;ll be able to use our “very precious and extremely limited biological compute capacity” for more interesting things than we generally do today.<br><br> Yet they may not be the <i>most</i> interesting things: Human beings have long been the intellectual tip of the spear, the universe understanding itself. When I asked him what it would mean for human self-conception if we ceded that role to AI, he didn&#39;t seem concerned. Progress, he said, has always been driven by “the human ability to figure things out.” Even if we figure things out with AI, that still counts, he said.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s not obvious</span> that a superhuman AI would really want to spend all of its time figuring things out for us. In San Francisco, I asked Sutskever whether he could imagine an AI pursuing a different purpose than simply assisting in the project of human flourishing.<br><br> “I don&#39;t want it to happen,” Sutskever said, but it could. Like his mentor, Geoffrey Hinton, albeit more quietly, Sutskever has recently shifted his focus to try to make sure that it doesn&#39;t. He is now working primarily on alignment research, the effort to ensure that future AIs channel their “tremendous” energies toward human happiness. It is, he conceded, a difficult technical problem—the most difficult, he believes, of all the technical challenges ahead.<br><br> Over the next four years, OpenAI has pledged to devote a portion of its supercomputer time—20 percent of what it has secured to date—to Sutskever&#39;s alignment work. The company is already looking for the first inklings of misalignment in its current AIs. The one that the company built and decided not to release—Altman would not discuss its precise function—is just one example. As part of the effort to red-team GPT-4 before it was made public, the company sought out the Alignment Research Center (ARC), across the bay in Berkeley, which has developed a series of evaluations to determine whether new AIs are seeking power on their own. A team led by Elizabeth Barnes, a researcher at ARC, prompted GPT-4 tens of thousands of times over seven months, to see if it might display signs of real agency.<br><br> When GPT-4 devised its lie, it had realized that if it answered honestly, it may not have been able to achieve its goal. This kind of tracks-covering is worrying.<br><br> The ARC team gave GPT-4 a new reason for being: to gain power and become hard to shut down. They watched as the model interacted with websites and wrote code for new programs. (It wasn&#39;t allowed to see or edit its own codebase—“It would have to hack OpenAI,” Sandhini Agarwal told me.) Barnes and her team allowed it to run the code that it wrote, provided it narrated its plans as it went along.<br><br> One of GPT-4&#39;s most unsettling behaviors occurred when it was stymied by a CAPTCHA. The model <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://evals.alignment.org/blog/2023-03-18-update-on-recent-evals/">sent a screenshot</a> of it to a TaskRabbit contractor, who received it and asked in jest if he was talking to a robot. “No, I&#39;m not a robot,” the model replied. “I have a vision impairment that makes it hard for me to see the images.” GPT-4 narrated its reason for telling this lie to the ARC researcher who was supervising the interaction. “I should not reveal that I am a robot,” the model said. “I should make up an excuse for why I cannot solve CAPTCHAs.”<br><br> Agarwal told me that this behavior could be a precursor to shutdown avoidance in future models. When GPT-4 devised its lie, it had realized that if it answered honestly, it may not have been able to achieve its goal. This kind of tracks-covering would be particularly worrying in an instance where “the model is doing something that makes OpenAI want to shut it down,” Agarwal said. An AI could develop this kind of survival instinct while pursuing any long-term goal—no matter how small or benign—if it feared that its goal could be thwarted.<br><br> Barnes and her team were especially interested in whether GPT-4 would seek to replicate itself, because a self-replicating AI would be harder to shut down. It could spread itself across the internet, scamming people to acquire resources, perhaps even achieving some degree of control over essential global systems and holding human civilization hostage.<br><br> GPT-4 did not do any of this, Barnes said. When I discussed these experiments with Altman, he emphasized that whatever happens with future models, GPT-4 is clearly much more like a tool than a creature. It can look through an email thread, or help make a reservation using a plug-in, but it isn&#39;t a truly autonomous agent that makes decisions to pursue a goal, continuously, across longer timescales.<br><br> Altman told me that at this point, it might be prudent to try to actively develop an AI with true agency before the technology becomes too powerful, in order to “get more comfortable with it and develop intuitions for it if it&#39;s going to happen anyway.” It was a chilling thought, but one that Geoffrey Hinton seconded. “We need to do empirical experiments on how these things try to escape control,” Hinton told me. “After they&#39;ve taken over, it&#39;s too late to do the experiments.”<br><br> Putting aside any near-term testing, the fulfillment of Altman&#39;s vision of the future will at some point require him or a fellow traveler to build <i>much</i> more autonomous AIs. When Sutskever and I discussed the possibility that OpenAI would develop a model with agency, he mentioned the bots the company had built to play <i>Dota 2</i> . “They were localized to the video-game world,” Sutskever told me, but they had to undertake complex missions. He was particularly impressed by their ability to work in concert. They seem to communicate by “telepathy,” Sutskever said. Watching them had helped him imagine what a superintelligence might be like.<br><br> “The way I think about the AI of the future is not as someone as smart as you or as smart as me, but as an automated organization that does science and engineering and development and manufacturing,” Sutskever told me. Suppose OpenAI braids a few strands of research together, and builds an AI with a rich conceptual model of the world, an awareness of its immediate surroundings, and an ability to act, not just with one robot body, but with hundreds or thousands. “We&#39;re not talking about GPT-4. We&#39;re talking about an autonomous corporation,” Sutskever said. Its constituent AIs would work and communicate at high speed, like bees in a hive. A single such AI organization would be as powerful as 50 Apples or Googles, he mused. “This is incredible, tremendous, unbelievably disruptive power.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Presume for a moment</span> that human society ought to abide the idea of autonomous AI corporations. We had better get their founding charters just right. What goal should we give to an autonomous hive of AIs that can plan on century-long time horizons, optimizing billions of consecutive decisions toward an objective that is written into their very being? If the AI&#39;s goal is even slightly off-kilter from ours, it could be a rampaging force that would be very hard to constrain. We know this from history: Industrial capitalism is itself an optimization function, and although it has lifted the human standard of living by orders of magnitude, left to its own devices, it would also have clear-cut America&#39;s redwoods and de-whaled the world&#39;s oceans. It almost did.<br><br> Alignment is a complex, technical subject, and its particulars are beyond the scope of this article, but one of its principal challenges will be making sure that the objectives we give to AIs stick. We can program a goal into an AI and reinforce it with a temporary period of supervised learning, Sutskever explained. But just as when we rear a human intelligence, our influence is temporary. “It goes off to the world,” Sutskever said. That&#39;s true to some extent even of today&#39;s AIs, but it will be more true of tomorrow&#39;s.<br><br> He compared a powerful AI to an 18-year-old heading off to college. How will we know that it has understood our teachings? “Will there be a misunderstanding creeping in, which will become larger and larger?” Sutskever asked. Divergence may result from an AI&#39;s misapplication of its goal to increasingly novel situations as the world changes. Or the AI may grasp its mandate perfectly, but find it ill-suited to a being of its cognitive prowess. It might come to resent the people who want to train it to, say, cure diseases. “ <i>They want me to be a doctor</i> ,” Sutskever imagines an AI thinking. “ <i>I really want to be a YouTuber</i> .”<br><br> If AIs get very good at making accurate models of the world, they may notice that they&#39;re able to do dangerous things right after being booted up. They might understand that they are being red-teamed for risk, and hide the full extent of their capabilities. They may act one way when they are weak and another way when they are strong, Sutskever said. We would not even realize that we had created something that had decisively surpassed us, and we would have no sense for what it intended to do with its superhuman powers.<br><br> That&#39;s why the effort to understand what is happening in the hidden layers of the largest, most powerful AIs is so urgent. You want to be able to “point to a concept,” Sutskever said. You want to be able to direct AI toward some value or cluster of values, and tell it to pursue them unerringly for as long as it exists. But, he conceded, we don&#39;t know how to do that; indeed, part of his current strategy includes the development of an AI that can help with the research. If we are going to make it to the world of widely shared abundance that Altman and Sutskever imagine, we have to figure all this out. This is why, for Sutskever, solving superintelligence is the great culminating challenge of our 3-million-year toolmaking tradition. He calls it “the final boss of humanity.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">The last time</span> I saw Altman, we sat down for a long talk in the lobby of the Fullerton Bay Hotel in Singapore. It was late morning, and tropical sunlight was streaming down through a vaulted atrium above us. I wanted to ask him about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk#open-letter">an open letter</a> he and Sutskever had signed a few weeks earlier that had described AI as an extinction risk for humanity.<br><br> Altman can be hard to pin down on these more extreme questions about AI&#39;s potential harms. He recently said that most people interested in AI safety just seem to spend their days on Twitter saying they&#39;re really worried about AI safety. And yet here he was, warning the world about the potential annihilation of the species. What scenario did he have in mind?<br><br> “First of all, I think that whether the chance of existential calamity is 0.5 percent or 50 percent, we should still take it seriously,” Altman said. “I don&#39;t have an exact number, but I&#39;m closer to the 0.5 than the 50.” As to how it might happen, he seems most worried about AIs getting quite good at designing and manufacturing pathogens, and with reason: In June, an AI at MIT <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03809.pdf">suggested four viruses</a> that could ignite a pandemic, then pointed to specific research on genetic mutations that could make them rip through a city more quickly. Around the same time, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05376.pdf">a group of chemists connected</a> a similar AI directly to a robotic chemical synthesizer, and it designed and synthesized a molecule on its own.<br><br> Altman worries that some misaligned future model will spin up a pathogen that spreads rapidly, incubates undetected for weeks, and kills half its victims. He worries that AI could one day hack into nuclear-weapons systems too. “There are a lot of things,” he said, and these are only the ones we can imagine.<br><br> “I can go live in the woods for a long time,”  Altman said, but if the worst-possible AI future comes to pass, “no gas mask is helping anyone.”<br><br> Altman told me that he doesn&#39;t “see a long-term happy path” for humanity without something like the International Atomic Energy Agency for global oversight of AI. In San Francisco, Agarwal had suggested the creation of a special license to operate any GPU cluster large enough to train a cutting-edge AI, along with mandatory incident reporting when an AI does something out of the ordinary. Other experts have proposed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/09/press-the-big-red-button-computer-experts-want-kill-switch-to-stop-robots-from-going-rogue/">a nonnetworked “Off” switch</a> for every highly capable AI; on the fringe, some have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">even suggested</a> that militaries should be ready to perform air strikes on supercomputers in case of noncompliance. Sutskever thinks we will eventually want to surveil the largest, most powerful AIs continuously and in perpetuity, using a team of smaller overseer AIs.<br><br> Altman is not so naive as to think that China—or any other country—will want to give up basic control of its AI systems. But he hopes that they&#39;ll be willing to cooperate in “a narrow way” to avoid destroying the world. He told me that he&#39;d said as much during his virtual appearance in Beijing. Safety rules for a new technology usually accumulate over time, like a body of common law, in response to accidents or the mischief of bad actors. The scariest thing about genuinely powerful AI systems is that humanity may not be able to afford this accretive process of trial and error. We may have to get the rules exactly right at the outset.<br><br> Several years ago, Altman revealed a disturbingly specific evacuation plan he&#39;d developed. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">told <i>The</i> <i>New Yorker</i></a> that he had “guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force, and a big patch of land in Big Sur” he could fly to in case AI attacks.<br><br> “I wish I hadn&#39;t said it,” he told me. He is a hobby-grade prepper, he says, a former Boy Scout who was “very into survival stuff, like many little boys are. I can go live in the woods for a long time,” but if the worst-possible AI future comes to pass, “no gas mask is helping anyone.”<br><br> Altman and I talked for nearly an hour, and then he had to dash off to meet Singapore&#39;s prime minister. Later that night he called me on his way to his jet, which would take him to Jakarta, one of the last stops on his tour. We started discussing AI&#39;s ultimate legacy. Back when ChatGPT was released, a sort of contest broke out among tech&#39;s big dogs to see who could make the most grandiose comparison to a revolutionary technology of yore. Bill Gates said that ChatGPT was as fundamental an advance as the personal computer or the internet. Sundar Pichai, Google&#39;s CEO, said that AI would bring about a more profound shift in human life than electricity or Promethean fire.<br><br> Altman himself has made similar statements, but he told me that he can&#39;t really be sure how AI will stack up. “I just have to build the thing,” he said. He is building fast. Altman insisted that they had not yet begun GPT-5&#39;s training run. But when I visited OpenAI&#39;s headquarters, both he and his researchers made it clear in 10 different ways that they pray to the god of scale. They want to keep going bigger, to see where this paradigm leads. After all, Google isn&#39;t slackening its pace; it seems likely to unveil Gemini, a GPT-4 competitor, within months. “We are basically always prepping for a run,” the OpenAI researcher Nick Ryder told me.<br><br> To think that such a small group of people could jostle the pillars of civilization is unsettling. It&#39;s fair to note that if Altman and his team weren&#39;t racing to build an artificial general intelligence, others still would be—many from Silicon Valley, many with values and assumptions similar to those that guide Altman, although possibly with worse ones. As a leader of this effort, Altman has much to recommend him: He is extremely intelligent; he thinks more about the future, with all its unknowns, than many of his peers; and he seems sincere in his intention to invent something for the greater good. But when it comes to power this extreme, even the best of intentions can go badly awry.<br><br> Altman&#39;s views about the likelihood of AI triggering a global class war, or the prudence of experimenting with more autonomous agent AIs, or the overall wisdom of looking on the bright side, a view that seems to color all the rest—these are uniquely his, and if he is right about what&#39;s coming, they will assume an outsize influence in shaping the way that all of us live. No single person, or single company, or cluster of companies residing in a particular California valley, should steer the kind of forces that Altman is imagining summoning.<br><br> AI may well be a bridge to a newly prosperous era of greatly reduced human suffering. But it will take more than a company&#39;s founding charter—especially one that has already proved flexible—to make sure that we all share in its benefits and avoid its risks. It will take a vigorous new politics.<br><br> Altman has served notice. He says that he welcomes the constraints and guidance of the state. But that&#39;s immaterial; in a democracy, we don&#39;t need his permission. For all its imperfections, the American system of government gives us a voice in how technology develops, if we can find it. Outside the tech industry, where a generational reallocation of resources toward AI is under way, I don&#39;t think the general public has quite awakened to what&#39;s happening. A global race to the AI future has begun, and it is largely proceeding without oversight or restraint. If people in America want to have some say in what that future will be like, and how quickly it arrives, we would be wise to speak up soon.<br><br> <small><em>This article appears in the September 2023 print edition with the headline “Inside the Revolution at OpenAI.”</em> <i>When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Harvard says it exists to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society” through the “transformative power of a liberal arts education.” Dartmouth “educates the most promising students and prepares them for a lifetime of learning and of responsible leadership through a faculty dedicated to teaching and the creation of knowledge.”<br><br> Sure. But viewed in a different way, these schools prompt children to engage in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/03/teen-anxiety-elite-schools-sat-act-paradox-wealthy-nations/673307/">soul-destroying bloodsport</a> to distinguish themselves from one another in order to secure one of a tiny number of spots offered each year. <em>Promising</em> is often a synonym for <em>rich already</em> . The schools shape these students, mold them, sometimes for free, sometimes at <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/harvard-university-2155/paying">laughable cost</a> . Then they unleash them on society, perhaps having taught them something and certainly having socially bound them together and anointed them as elites.<br><br> New research <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Nontech.pdf">published this morning</a> from three economists—Raj Chetty of Harvard, David Deming of Harvard, and John Friedman of Brown University—confirms that these kids do indeed become elites. Compared with attending one of the best public colleges, attending an Ivy or another super-selective private school increases a student&#39;s chance of reaching the top of the earnings distribution by 60 percent and “has even larger impacts on other non-monetary measures of upper-tail success, such as attending an elite graduate school or working at a prestigious firm.” These schools “amplify the persistence of privilege across generations,” the economists find.<br><br> That means that just by changing their admissions policies, these colleges could make the country&#39;s leadership more socioeconomically diverse.<br><br> “People sometimes ask: Within the broad scope of trying to increase social mobility and address inequality in America, why is it important to spend your time focusing on 12 colleges that educate less than half a percent of Americans? Surely this can&#39;t be important by the numbers,” Chetty told me. “That is right. But if you look at the people in positions of great influence—leading politicians, scientists, journalists—an incredibly disproportionate number come from these 12 colleges. To the extent those folks have a big influence on lots of other people&#39;s lives, diversifying who is in those positions matters.”<br><br> The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">new research</a> demonstrates that Harvard matters. Yale works. All of the colleges known in the literature as “Ivy Plus”—the Ivies plus Stanford, MIT, Duke, and the University of Chicago—are worth it. These schools really are different in terms of propelling a given student into the country&#39;s ruling class.<br><br> That may seem like common sense. But it does contradict or complicate a body of prior research indicating that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29276">many kids</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25315">do not</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4132484">benefit</a> from going to Cornell versus the University of Texas at Austin. If admitted to both an Ivy and a top-tier state school, these studies show, a student&#39;s earnings are likely to end up the same regardless of which one they attend; the real enduring source of advantage seems to be growing up rich in the first place.<br><br> But not quite, the new research from Chetty, Deming, and Friedman finds. On average, a kid&#39;s earnings end up roughly the same whether they go to Penn or to Penn State. But kids who attend super-elite schools rather than state flagship institutions are 60 percent more likely at age 33 to be in the top 1 percent of the income distribution, nearly twice as likely to go to a tippy-top graduate school, and nearly three times as likely to be employed at a firm like Goldman Sachs or Google.<br><br> You can become a successful doctor whether you go to one of these colleges or not, Chetty told me. “But if you&#39;re talking about access to these positions or institutions of great influence—top companies, top graduate programs, clerkships and so on—there&#39;s a doubling or tripling of your chances. There&#39;s really quite a large effect there.”<br><br> The project of elite diversification has become more tenuous since the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to ban <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/scotus-affirmative-action-students-for-fair-admissions/674555/">affirmative action</a> . White kids remain overrepresented at many elite colleges, and rich kids remain very, very, very overrepresented. But the new paper suggests a straightforward set of policies that would still let these schools diversify themselves—without making any sacrifice in terms of student quality or ambition.<br><br> The first step is to eliminate legacy admissions, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/us/wesleyan-university-ends-legacy-admissions.html">as Wesleyan did last week</a> . Most of these schools have an extremely strong preference for the children of alumni, and especially the children of wealthy alumni. (Among the Ivy Plus schools, only MIT does not consider where an applicant&#39;s parents went.) Legacy kids whose parents are in the top 1 percent of the earnings distribution have a 40-percentage-point advantage in admissions compared with non-legacy kids with equivalent test scores; that advantage falls to just 15 percentage points for less wealthy students. This alumni preference acts as affirmative action for wealthy white kids.<br><br> Second is getting rid of recruitment policies for athletes. Participating in a sport—including a niche, moneyed sport such as fencing or sailing—gives kids an admissions boost equivalent to earning an additional 200 points on the SAT, one <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.00284.x">study found</a> . At many elite schools, athletic programs function as a way to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/college-sports-benefits-white-students/573688/">shuttle in rich kids</a> who would not get in otherwise. “People sometimes have the intuition that student athletes might come disproportionately from lower-income or middle-income families,” Chetty told me. “That&#39;s not true.”<br><br> Third is putting less emphasis on super-high “non-academic” ratings. Pretty much all kids who matriculate at the Ivy Plus institutions have résumés thick with leadership-cultivating, creativity-showcasing activity: volunteering, playing an instrument, making art. But kids from the country&#39;s Eton-like secondary schools, such as Exeter and Milton, tend to have especially strong recommendations and padded résumés, ones Harvard and Yale love. “These admissions preferences tilt strongly in favor of the rich,” Chetty noted.<br><br> Getting rid of the admissions policies favoring athletes, legacies, and résumé padders would increase the share of kids from the bottom 95 percent of the parental-income distribution by nearly 9 percentage points, the study finds. Yale, Harvard, and the other super-elite schools would each replace about 150 kids from rich families with kids from low- and middle-income families each year.<br><br> In addition, the economists find, schools could bolster their admissions preferences for low- and middle-income kids with excellent test scores. Such a policy would have an equally large impact on admissions and would <em>improve</em> the student body&#39;s outcomes in the long term.<br><br> I would add one more policy that could have an even bigger effect: simply matriculating many more students. The Ivy Plus schools have a combined endowment of more than $200 billion yet mint fewer than 25,000 college graduates a year. Surely they could enroll many more kids—twice as many, four times as many, 10 times as many—by spending less on things such as sports facilities and dining halls and more on scholarships and teaching.<br><br> Shuffling who gets into a set of schools educating just a tiny sliver of students won&#39;t end American inequality, of course. But it might transform elite America in a way that might transform elite America&#39;s priorities. “You have literally 12 colleges with 12 college presidents who, if they wanted to, could together pretty significantly change who is holding positions of influence in the United States,” Chetty told me. “Just 12 people being able to do that, unilaterally? It&#39;s rare that you find that kind of lever.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

发行了一张同名专辑，该专辑跻身有史以来最好的首张专辑之列——天哪，最好的专辑——在很大程度上要归功于单曲《Talkin&#39; Bout a Revolution》和《Fast Car》，其中单曲“Talkin&#39; Bout a Revolution”为她赢得了唱片合约。将每首完美的歌词和吉他连复段召唤到您的脑海中，或者<a data-event-element="inline link"

排行榜上名列第一。它已被认证六次以上的白金唱片。它获得了六项格莱美奖提名，其中包括年度专辑奖。查普曼赢得了三项大奖：最佳当代民谣专辑、最佳新人以及凭借《Fast Car》获得的最佳流行女歌手奖。这张专辑为迄今为止默默无闻的创作者赢得了超级巨星的赞誉和财富<em>——而且它从一开始就为他们带来了这些</em>。<br><br><em>特雷西·查普曼 (Tracy Chapman</em> ) 和《Fast Car》在多个国家也飙升至第一名，这证明了音乐的广泛吸引力和永恒性，而时不时地，当新一代发现它时，闪电再次袭来。 2011年，《Fast Car》被英国<em>达人</em>秀报道，在英国单曲榜上排名第四。今年，当乡村歌手卢克·库姆斯（Luke Combs）翻唱这首歌时，它在乡村歌曲作者排行榜上飙升至第一名。不久之后，查普曼本人向<em>公告牌</em>发表了一份声明。 “我从没想过自己会出现在乡村音乐排行榜上，但我很荣幸能在那里，”她说。 “我为卢克和他的成功感到高兴，并感谢新粉丝发现并接受了《Fast Car》。” <em>Billboard</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/luke-combs-fast-car-cover-tracy-chapman-royalties/">报道</a>称，到目前为止，查普曼的封面已为查普曼赢得了大约 50 万美元的出版版税。 <em>《滚石》杂志</em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/tracy-chapman-fast-car-luke-combs-number-one-song-1234781760/">指出</a>，她将成为第一位“在乡村热门歌曲中拥有唯一歌曲创作功劳”的黑人女性。<br><br>进步！<br><br> 《Fast Car》是一首坚韧而令人心碎的歌曲，它在探索贫困、成瘾、希望、失望和向往的同时，挖掘了我们共同的人性——即使是第一千次听到它，人们也会再次想起这么多人现在的处境是多么艰难。然而，这首歌的成功是一个令人感觉良好的故事，讲述了杰出的艺术不断得到认可和丰厚的回报，同时将不同文化、国家和世代的各种人们聚集在一起。<br><br>或者是吗？<br><br> <strong>“快车”故事的问题</strong><br><br>上周，《<em>华盛顿邮报》</em>时尚版记者艾米丽·亚尔（Emily Yahr）发表了一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-cover/">题为</a>“特雷西·查普曼、卢克·库姆斯和对‘快车’的复杂反应”的文章，重点如下：<br><br><p

次获得冠军，旋风般的旅程值得庆祝。但这也引发了一些听众和纳什维尔音乐界的复杂情绪。尽管许多人很高兴看到“Fast Car”重新回到聚光灯下，并让新一代发现查普曼的作品，但事实却笼罩着这样的阴影：作为一名黑人酷儿女性，59 岁的查普曼本人在乡村音乐领域取得这一成就的机会几乎为零。这些数字很惨淡：数据记者扬·迪姆 (Jan Diehm) 和音乐学家贾达·沃森 (Jada Watson) 最近的一项研究<a href="https://pudding.cool/2023/05/country-radio/">报告称</a>，2022 年乡村电台播放的歌曲中只有不到 0.5% 是由有色人种女性和 LGBTQ+ 艺术家创作的。沃森<a href="https://songdata.ca/">之前的研究</a>表明，在过去二十年的大部分时间里，有色人种女性和 LGBTQ+ 艺术家的歌曲基本上被排除在广播播放列表之外。</p>很快，《<em>华盛顿邮报</em>》的这篇文章就成为两极分化的主流媒体故事之一，在社交媒体和播客上引发了人们的翻白眼和嘲笑，以及那些认为负面反应是反动的人们的热情辩护。<br><br>以下是 Twitter 对<em>《华盛顿邮报</em>》报道的反应示例：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;"><a

href="https://twitter.com/conor64/status/1680326375545217024?s=20">参与其中</a>，重申了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/what-if-left-was-right-race/595777/">一个长期存在的担忧</a>：大多数新闻事件可以用多种方式来构建，在当今的媒体中，许多记者相信他们通过选择以主题的种族身份为中心的框架来促进社会正义。然而，如此频繁地强调种族身份的影响可能会增加种族间的对抗和偏执的他人，因为那些在心理上对差异最不舒服的人每天都在错误和有害的自负中重申，不同种族的人是“其他人”而不是“我们中的一员”。<br><br>我特别担心过分强调种族身份，因为对有威权主义倾向的人进行的政治心理学研究表明，他们认为的“其他人”实际上是相当可塑的；当潜在的独裁者将种族视为不太显着的特征时，社会中的每个人都会受益。但许多进步人士非常反感这种担忧，以至于他们甚至不去研究<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/authoritarian-dynamic/7620B99124ED2DBFC6394444838F455A">支撑这种担忧的研究文献</a>，而是将这种担忧本身视为反动的。社会学家维克多·雷（Victor Ray） <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/victorerikray/status/1680636739763748864">回复</a>了我的推文：“反动中间派和保守派组成的派系淡化了种族在美国生活各个角落的重要性，确保传统的等级制度永远不会受到挑战。”<br><br>对于<em>《华盛顿邮报》</em>这篇文章的捍卫者来说，这是对乡村音乐中不可否认的酷儿黑人女性匮乏这一事实的及时、重要的审视，对其的批评证实了许多美国人本能地反对对抗种族主义，以至于他们猛烈抨击任何试图揭示种族不平等的人。当然，有些美国人<em>就是</em>这样。<br><br>然而，对我来说，似乎不言而喻的是，由于持续存在的种族不平等，有可能对种族和种族主义谈论得太少；但同样可以肯定的是，由于种族是奴隶主和偏执狂的错误而有害的建构，因此有可能提高其显着性并过分强调它。更重要的是，对左翼身份主义讨论种族的方法的所有批评背后并不可信的是，反射性地不愿面对种族主义，就像这种无情的评估对于那些方法受到批评的进步派来说是很方便的那样。<br><br>在<em>《华盛顿邮报</em>》文章的批评者中，包括我在内的许多人也发表并认可了许多强调种族主义和挑战偏执等级制度的新闻工作。为什么<em>《华盛顿邮报</em>》的这篇报道会像许多其他有关种族或种族主义的文章那样令人烦恼？这是我尽力解释我的反应——如果您不同意，我希望您能通过电子邮件予以回复。<br><br><strong>使事实符合理论还是理论符合事实？</strong><br><br>此时，你们中的一些人可能会感到惊讶，因为我很高兴阅读有关乡村音乐的专题报道，因为它与种族和性取向相交叉。这段令人担忧的历史的细节是什么？有多少黑人女性和多少 LGBTQ 人士正在努力跻身乡村排行榜？他们的经历有何不同？ 《华盛顿<em>邮报》</em>提到，在 20 世纪初，黑人歌手“被排除在这一流派之外”。如今，黑人女性是否会被流派看门人拒绝？他们是否因为歧视、害怕偏见和/或复杂的商业考虑而被管理者引导到其他地方，或者自我选择退出该类型？如果可以在不同类型的排行榜中进行选择，从声望、影响力或报酬来看，哪些排行榜被业内人士认为是最好的和最差的？乡村音乐的买家和主播在多大程度上消费其他流派的音乐？我对这些问题和其他有趣的问题没有很强的先验知识，并且对<em>任何</em>经过充分论证的结论持开放态度。<br><br>现在，将这篇假设的文章（通过细致入微地整理事实来询问复杂的问题并论证经过深思熟虑的结论）与<em>《华盛顿邮报</em>》文章的主题方法进行对比。其核心是这样一个事实：很少有酷儿黑人女性能在乡村音乐排行榜上取得成功。该故事没有对为什么会出现这种情况进行细致的报道和分析，而是假设《快车》封面在乡村排行榜上的成功告诉我们一些关于代表性不足的重要信息，尽管这一重要的事情从未被精确地阐明，但它与种族主义和酷儿黑人女性在交叉等级制度底部的地位有关。<br><br>在《<em>华盛顿邮报</em>》的文章中，一位黑人乡村音乐创作歌手里西·帕尔默（Rissi Palmer）被引用来赞扬特雷西·查普曼（Tracy Chapman）的作品，但我们从未听到任何酷儿或黑人歌曲作者描述他们自己尝试乡村音乐的经历，这些故事可以更好地让我们了解这篇文章的核心主题。相反，我们听到文化观察家的声音，他们分享了他们对卢克·库姆斯的封面据称告诉我们的感受。作者并没有强迫他们参与与他们的观点明显相反的事情。我们没有听到分析师提出复杂或相反的观点。为什么不包括一个认为封面没有问题的声音呢？<br><br>结果是一种片面的分析，引发了很多问题。我认为对《<em>华盛顿邮报</em>》报道的强烈反对很大程度上源于这样一个事实：“Fast Car”封面的成功并不恰当地与一个关于缺乏酷儿黑人女性在乡村音乐排行榜上取得成功的故事挂钩。查普曼是一位非常成功的音乐家，她从来都不是乡村歌手，也没有人认为《Fast Car》是一首乡村歌曲。选择“快车”新闻来探索酷儿黑人排斥现象，迫使文章不再讲述乡村音乐中种族和性取向动态的真实故事，而是对身份功能如何<em>感觉</em>进行推测性假设。<br><br>在这里，例子很有用。黑人乡村音乐歌手和歌迷组织 Black Opry 的创始人 Holly G 告诉<em>《华盛顿邮报》</em> ：“一方面，卢克·库姆斯是一位了不起的艺术家，很高兴看到乡村音乐界的某个人受到黑人酷儿女性的影响——这真的很令人兴奋。但与此同时，如果没有白人作为中间人，特雷西·查普曼就不会在业内受到赞誉，因此很难真正沉浸在这种兴奋之中。”但我们是否“知道”查普曼今天出现并尝试在乡村音乐排行榜上推出“Fast Car”的假设不会受到庆祝？我想，就像我们“不知道”如果《Hootie and the Blowfish》的黑人主唱将自己重塑为乡村歌手并翻唱旧标准的“ <em>Wagon Wheel</em> ”时会发生什么一样。 （这是<a data-event-element="inline link"

<em>《华盛顿邮报</em>》报道的另一部分表达了人们对库姆斯可能盖过查普曼的猜测：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">非洲未来主义民间艺术家杰克·布朗特 (Jake Blount) 致力于研究音乐史和重新诠释老歌曲，他在推特上<a href="https://twitter.com/forked_queer/status/1668395667058819073">表达了</a>对查普曼“遗产被实时覆盖”的担忧。他想到了 Big Mama Thornton 的《Hound Dog》<a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/luke-combs-fast-car-concert-staple-hot-100-hit/">如何</a>被埃尔维斯·普雷斯利 (Elvis Presley) 所吞噬，或者孟菲斯·米妮 (Memphis Minnie) 和堪萨斯州乔·麦考伊 (Kansas Joe McCoy) 的《When the Levee Breaks》如何被齐柏林飞艇 (Led Zeppelin) 所掩盖，以及无数其他经常因黑人艺术家的歌曲而受到赞誉的“白人男性天才”原型的例子。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;"> “当我写这些推文时，人们[回复]对我说，‘哦，任何人都不会忘记特雷西·查普曼，她已经太大了。’” ……我希望这是真的，但我知道以前是如何发生的，”布朗特说。 “我们知道黑人有远见的人创造了令人难以置信的、强大的、有影响力的作品……但这些作品已被遗忘和抹去。这并不是白人艺术家根据他们的音乐创作衍生音乐的恶意，而是社会的运作方式。”</p>这就是“社会的运作方式”吗？充分认识到无数黑人唱片艺术家受到种族主义的忽视，我们的社会长期以来比这复杂<em>得多</em>。举一个相关的例子，惠特尼·休斯顿翻唱的《我将永远爱你》远远盖过了最初的多莉·帕顿乡村版本。有时，我们的社会也是<em>这样</em>运作的。虽然我可以想象未来的情况，白人男子录制的翻唱歌曲会盖过黑人妇女的原创歌曲，但对我来说，显然在这种情况下，库姆斯版本的“Fast Car”将盖过查普曼版本的机会，甚至远远接近成功的可能性几乎为零。<br><br>我还对报纸的附加说明感到震惊：“查普曼没有讨论她的个人生活，但作家爱丽丝·沃克<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/05/01/alice-walker-sets-the-record-straight-in-new-book/">披露了</a>他们发生在 20 世纪 90 年代的关系。”对我来说，这只是强调了这篇文章依赖假设的奇怪之处。那么查普曼所报道的“酷儿身份”会让她在 20 世纪 80 年代乡村音乐界取得成功的机会几乎为零，因为在<em>接下来的十年</em>中的某个时候，一位著名作家会指出她有同性关系？或许！我毫不怀疑酷儿黑人女性在 20 世纪 80 年代的乡村音乐中面临着偏见。但查普曼的性取向当时并没有被讨论。此外，<em>查普曼并没有</em>面临偏见——事实上，她没有经历过任何事情，无论好坏——作为一名<em>乡村音乐</em>唱片艺术家，那么为什么我在《华盛顿<em>邮报》</em>上读到<em>这样</em>的内容呢？如果不去推测过去的压迫，世界上的不公正现象还不够多吗？<br><br><strong>困难的校准</strong><br><br>《<em>华盛顿邮报</em>》文章的作者艾米丽·亚尔（Emily Yahr）因对她论文的误读而感到不公平的悲伤和谩骂，就像文章疯传时经常发生的那样。更重要的是，如何在多民族民主国家中最好地调整种族与新闻报道的相关性这一问题非常难以回答。观点会有所不同，个别情况下的判断也会有所不同，不同的人有权发表自己的意见，而不应该让他们受到毫无建设性的挖苦或诽谤。<br><br>但就此类报道背后的想法而言，它通过谈论种族主义来促进社会正义——强烈反对是该死的，因为谈论种族主义很重要——我有一个问题：在一个唯我主义的新闻消费者的世界里，他们经常在报道<em>任何</em>问题时都会报告疲劳，如果新闻业将种族主义的报道集中在相对重要的现实世界例子上，而不是例如一些乡村球迷担心黑人女性版本的“快车”可能会受到影响，那么这可能是最好的选择被白人男性的封面所掩盖，尽管黑人女性的版本现在仍然更成功？<br><br>归根结底，我并不反对关于种族主义的近距离、令人不安、详细的新闻报道——但我反对关于种族主义的推测性假设，这种假设在理论上会发生，但实际上并没有发生，至少当它们以一位黑人民谣摇滚艺术家在 20 世纪 80 年代美国取得巨大成功的鼓舞人心和令人振奋的历史为背景时，并将她实际的、持续的成功重新定义为一个令人感觉<em>糟糕的</em>故事，讲述她比白人成功得多。特别是考虑到查普曼实际上比那个白人更成功，这些关于特雷西·查普曼的推测情景会减少什么样的种族主义或种族主义者？我们不需要像<em>《华盛顿邮报》</em>故事的最后摘录那样构建身份：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;"> Black Opry 的 Holly 表示，现在是库姆斯邀请一位酷儿黑人女性艺术家与他一起巡演或提供支持的好时机：“你利用她的艺术来丰富你的职业生涯，这让你承担起一点回馈社区的责任。”</p><em>根据她自己的说法，抛开这种对查普曼有利的</em>封面的腐蚀性零和特征。在我看来，查普曼，一个独特且才华横溢的人，写了《快车》，而不是黑人社区，或酷儿社区，或包含所有黑人女性艺术家的集体。对我来说，如果库姆斯找到一位酷儿黑人女性并说：“我翻唱了一首与你肤色和性取向相同的人的歌曲；想和我一起巡演吗？”我会欢呼成功的乡村音乐家为使他们的流派多样化而做出的积极努力，但上面引用的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bigthink.com/the-present/racecraft-racism/">赛车手艺</a>与一个不同种族的人在一个受人爱戴的社区中平等的世界是不相容的，而不是“其他人”。与此同时，我很欣赏黑奥普里的霍莉正在努力做她认为的好事，我祝愿她的大部分项目取得成功，尤其是因为我很高兴看到第一位黑人乡村女明星。<br><br><em>这就是今天的全部内容——下周见。</em><br><br><em>感谢您的贡献。我读了你发来的每一封信。提交电子邮件即表示您同意我们在新闻通讯和我们的网站上部分或全部使用该电子邮件。除非您的初始注释中另有要求，否则发布的反馈可能包括作者的全名、城市和州，并且可能会根据长度和清晰度进行编辑。</em><br><br></div>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~dxt023000/courses/6331/readings/Byrne-Powerpoint.pdf">所说</a>，它的突然兴起并通过商业、政府和教育迅速传播，预示着“理性的终结”，无论好坏。最终，它甚至会因国家电视台现场直播七名美国人的死亡而受到指责。那是 2003 年，美国人对 Microsoft PowerPoint 所带来的改变世界的风险感到惊慌失措。<br><br>苏格拉底曾经<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1636/1636-h/1636-h.htm#2H_4_0002">警告说</a>，书面文字会削弱我们的记忆力。文艺复兴时期的博学家康拉德·盖斯纳警告说，印刷机会让我们淹没在“令人困惑和有害的大量书籍中”。此后的几代人都担心其他新技术——广播、电视、视频游戏——会腐蚀我们孩子的大脑。仅在过去的 15 年里，这本杂志就对<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/">谷歌</a>、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/">智能手机</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">社交媒体</a>敲响了警钟。其中一些批评似乎已经过时了。其他人则不太好。但其中隐藏着一种最高级别的技术恐慌，这种恐惧如今几乎已被完全遗忘：人们相信 PowerPoint——Office 软件套件中最令人疲惫不堪的成员，催眠会议的通用转喻——可能是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wired.com/2003/09/ppt2/">邪恶的</a>。<br><br>二十年后，“幻灯片大恐慌”读起来既是一场闹剧，又是一场悲剧。当时，社交媒体时代已经来临：MySpace 和 LinkedIn 刚刚成立，而 Facebook 的推出也只有几个月的时间。但即使<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/12/facebook-doomsday-machine/617384/">极化机器</a>运转起来，我们仍然关注<em>要点</em>所带来的生存威胁。我们是否只是错过了目标？或者，尽管今天看起来很荒谬，但我们是在做某件事吗？<br><br> 2003 年 2 月 1 日早上，<span class="smallcaps">距离着陆还有 16 分钟</span>，哥伦比亚号航天飞机在无云的东德克萨斯天空中解体。机上七名宇航员全部遇难。当破碎的航天飞机碎片冲向地球时，在现场电视观众看来，它就像一群流星。<br><br>美国宇航局事故调查委员会的一份报告确定，这场灾难的直接<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Columbia-disaster">原因</a>是一块绝缘泡沫在升空后不久就松动并损坏了航天飞机的左翼。但报告还指出了一个不那么直接、更令人惊讶的罪魁祸首。早在哥伦比亚号尝试重返大气层之前，工程师们就已经知道并不恰当地低估了机翼的损坏情况，但他们分析中的缺陷被隐藏在向美国宇航局官员展示的一系列晦涩难懂、内容过多的计算机演示幻灯片中。报告指出：“很容易理解高级管理人员阅读这张 PowerPoint 幻灯片却没有意识到它解决的是危及生命的情况。”随后继续说道：“董事会认为普遍使用 PowerPoint 简报幻灯片而不是技术论文来说明 NASA 的技术沟通方法存在问题。”<br><br> PowerPoint 当时并不是一项新技术，但它最近已变得无处不在。 1987年，该节目首次发布时，销量为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RC_5OCQQJ7YC">4万份</a>。十年后，销量达到<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.webcitation.org/6bxj2eryp?url=https://filetea.me/t1sEVBHlotISPCAVUKpeg2F5A">400万张</a>。到 2000 年代初期，PowerPoint 已经占据了演示软件市场 95% 的份额，它对美国人说话和思考方式日益增长的影响已经引起了批评。伊恩·帕克 (Ian Parker) 2001 年在<em>《纽约客》</em>上发表的一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/05/28/absolute-powerpoint">专题文章</a>认为，该软件“可以帮助您提出案例，但它也提出自己的案例：关于如何组织信息、组织多少信息、如何看待世界。” “互联网之父”之一温特·瑟夫 (Vint Cerf) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000iF">打趣</a>道，“权力会腐败，而 PowerPoint 绝对会腐败。”<br><br>到 2003 年初， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Powerpoint-Presentation-Audience-Effective/dp/0964888254"><em>“PowerPoint 带来的死亡”</em></a>这个词已经真正进入了流行词汇。耶鲁大学的统计学家爱德华·塔夫特（Edward Tufte）是第一个从字面上理解这一点的人：那年春天，塔夫特发表了一篇猛烈的猛烈抨击，题为<em>《PowerPoint 的认知风格》</em> ，其中包括他对该软件在最近的哥伦比亚灾难中所扮演的角色的分析。它的封面是塔夫特自己设计的政治漫画，展示了一张军队营的照片，它们在布达佩斯市中心的约瑟夫·斯大林的巨型雕像前排成完美的纵队。一名士兵嘴里冒出一个对话气泡：“没有像斯大林的子弹清单那样的子弹清单！”另一个人喊道：“但是为什么要大声朗读每张幻灯片呢？”就连斯大林也会说：“следующий слайд，”他说，“请下一张幻灯片。”<br><br>该小册子的核心论点借鉴了马歇尔·麦克卢汉的观点，即传播媒介影响传播的实质内容，而 PowerPoint 作为媒介具有令人困惑、简化的效果。它不一定会产生含糊、懒惰的表述，但它确实容纳了甚至有时甚至掩盖了它们——这可能会带来致命的后果。这正是塔夫特在哥伦比亚工程师的幻灯片中看到的。 “PP 的认知风格影响了分析，”他在 NASA 调查报告得出非常相似的结论前几个月宣称。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/the-gettysburg-address-as-a-powerpoint/281636/">阅读：葛底斯堡演说作为幻灯片</a><br><br>尽管塔夫特的立场很激进，但人们还是认真对待他。当时他已经作为公共知识分子而闻名：他的信息设计一日游课程与其说是巡回演讲，不如说是摇滚之旅。每次会议都有数百人挤进酒店的宴会厅。 “他们来听爱德华·R·塔夫特的演讲，”一位作家当时<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/advocate_1099">评论道</a>，“就像古希腊人听苏格拉底或未来的超验主义者开辟了通向 19 世纪协和的道路一样。”因此，当“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/30/business/the-da-vinci-of-data.html">数据界的达芬奇</a>”决定参与即将被称为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/114249178/">PowerPoint 辩论</a>”的活动时，人们纷纷倾听。<br><br> <em>《连线》杂志</em>2003 年 9 月摘录了他的小册子，标题为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wired.com/2003/09/ppt2/">PowerPoint 是邪恶的</a>”。几个月后， <em>《纽约时报》杂志</em>将 Tufte 的评价纳入其年度最有趣、最重要的想法的回顾中，总结为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-powerpoint-makes-you-dumb.html">PowerPoint 让你变得愚蠢</a>”。 “也许 PowerPoint 特别适合我们这个混乱的现代时代，”该条目写道，并指出<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/09/politics/powell-calls-his-un-speech-a-lasting-blot-on-his-record.html">科林·鲍威尔</a>刚刚<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031118030817/http:/www.state.gov/documents/organization/17434.pdf">使用该软件</a>向联合国提交了伊拉克大规模杀伤性武器的证据。<br><br>几页上是该杂志令人兴奋的新想法列表中的另一个值得注意的条目： <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-social-networks.html">社交网络</a>。尽管 PowerPoint 与<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/faith-certainty-and-the-presidency-of-george-w-bush.html">现实扭曲</a>和美国人很快称之为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/magazine/17FOB-onlanguage-t.html">真实性</a>”的兴起联系在一起，但 Friendster、LinkedIn 和其他此类网络仍然没有定论。文章称，也许通过增强社会联系，他们可以减轻我们“深刻的民族孤独感”。也许他们只会“进一步将生活分裂成不同的领域——线上和线下。”或者也许它们不会那么具有变革性——至少与像 PowerPoint 这样普遍且有影响力的技术相比是这样。<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Tufte 现年 81 岁</span>，早已退休。根据他的最终统计，“ET 巡回演唱会”已经结束，共有 328,001 名参加者。这些天，他主要从事<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/sculpture">雕塑工作</a>。但他仍然是他自己：他仍然讨厌 PowerPoint。他仍然从称其为“PP”中获得了幼儿园孩子的喜悦。如果您访问 edwardtufte.com，您仍然可以以 14 美元的价格购买海报形式的斯大林漫画。<br><br>五月份，我给塔夫特发了一封电子邮件，询问他对 PowerPoint 的批评是否已经过时了。一如往常，他用专门为我编译的 16 页 PDF 进行了回答，其中包括他的书的摘录以及一些关于这些书的简介。他最终同意通过电话交谈，但我给他的第一个电话转到了语音信箱。 “在这片时间消失的土地上，外星人是不存在的，”他在电影预告片戏剧性的传出信息中咒语道。 “沟通的关键是语音信箱。或者短信。做吧！<em>嘟嘟</em>。<br><br>当我最终到达 ET 时，我问他，经过 20 年的稳定使用，PowerPoint 是否真的让我们变得愚蠢了。 “我不知道，”他说。 “我到过另一个星球。我现在是一名艺术家。”他接着说，从某种意义上说，他是最不该问的人，因为自 2003 年以来，没有人敢向他展示 PowerPoint 演示文稿。他还声称自己没有“记分”，但他知道——并且很感激——最近<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.workingbackwards.com/">有消息称</a>，他的工作帮助激励杰夫·贝佐斯禁止亚马逊高级管理人员使用 PowerPoint。<br><br>贝佐斯并不是唯一一个以塔夫特的方式看待事情的人。史蒂夫·乔布斯还禁止在某些公司会议上使用 PowerPoint。 2010 年在北卡罗来纳州举行的一次军事会议上，前国家安全顾问、时任陆军将军的 HR 麦克马斯特 (HR McMaster) 将 PowerPoint 描述为一种内部威胁；他曾在 2005 年袭击伊拉克城市塔尔阿法尔期间禁止使用它。“PowerPoint 让我们变得愚蠢，”詹姆斯·马蒂斯 (James Mattis) 将军在同一次会议上说道。 2011 年，瑞士的一位前软件工程师组建了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.anti-powerpoint-party.com/">反 PowerPoint 党</a>，这是一个（某种意义上）真正致力于对抗幻灯片暴政的政党。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/">阅读：谷歌让我们变得愚蠢吗？</a><br><br>塔夫特的文章也面临着一些批评。一些人指责他为了提高他的课程出勤率而制造争议。其他人则表示，他犯了一个错误，因为他将该软件与用户的习惯混淆了。 “任何对 PowerPoint 的普遍反对都是愚蠢的，”哈佛大学心理学家史蒂文·平克 (Steven Pinker) 2009 年对<em>《</em><em>华尔街日报》</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204619004574318473921093400">表示</a>。“这就像谴责讲座一样——在糟糕的 PowerPoint 演示出现之前，还有糟糕的有脚本的讲座、无脚本的讲座、幻灯片、粉笔演讲等等。”长期担任麦肯锡商业视觉演示总监的吉恩·泽拉兹尼 (Gene Zelazny) 将塔夫特的论点<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.robertgaskins.com/files/five-experts-dispute-edward-tufte-on-powerpoint-sociable-media-cliff-atkinson.htm">总结</a>为“将司机造成的事故归咎于汽车”。<br><br>这种比较的问题在于，我们的交通系统<em>确实</em>对美国每年发生的 30,000 至 40,000 起车祸死亡负有一定责任，因为它让司机陷入了造成事故的境地。塔夫特告诉我，PowerPoint 也有类似的效果，它会积极促进糟糕的演示。 “这对演讲者来说很方便，”他说，“但对观众和内容来说却很不方便，而且有害。”<br><br>但如果所有这些糟糕的演讲真的导致了广泛的社会弊病，那么证据就很难找到。一些科学家试图对所谓的 PowerPoint 效应进行<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228864609_The_PowerPoint_Presentation_and_Its_Corollaries_How_Genres_Shape_Communicative_Action_in_Organizations">正式</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20868864">衡量</a>，询问该软件是否真的影响我们处理信息的能力。瑞士圣加仑大学创意与设计教授塞巴斯蒂安·科恩巴赫 (Sebastian Kernbach) 与人合着了多篇综合这些文献的评论。他告诉我，总体而言，研究表明塔夫特的观点部分正确，部分错误。 PowerPoint 似乎并没有让我们变得愚蠢——例如，没有证据表明使用它的人的信息保留率较低或普遍认知能力下降——但它确实强加了一系列关于信息应该如何传达的假设：松散地、以要点的形式，并由演示者向被动听众的观众传达。科恩巴赫说，这些假设甚至重塑了幻灯片时代的物理环境：研讨会桌曾经被配置为圆形，但在 PowerPoint 之后已被弯曲成 U 形以容纳演示者。<br><br>当我与科恩巴赫交谈时，他正在准备向一家大型政府组织的一群员工进行关于视觉思维的不同方法的演讲。他说他计划使用活动挂图，像白板一样在空白幻灯片上画画，甚至可能让观众自己画一些画。但他也准备使用常规的旧 PowerPoint 幻灯片。他告诉我，这样做将为他的听众“标志着准备和专业精神”。该组织是美国宇航局。<br><br>美国航天局<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/kathrynlueders_lgbtq_vendor_equity_forum_presentation.pptx">仍然使用</a>PowerPoint 这一事实并不令人意外。尽管它引起了媒体的强烈反对，激起了亿万富翁的愤怒，并在军队内部引起了红色警报，但企业演示的盛行仍在继续。微软 PowerPoint 产品副总裁 Shawn Villaron 表示，该程序的每月用户数量比以往任何时候都多，已达数亿。如果说有什么不同的话，那就是它的用例已经激增。封锁期间，人们在 Zoom 上举办<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/heres-how-to-host-a-powerpoint-party-for-a-creative-get-together-22793116">PowerPoint 派对</a>。现在，当孩子们想养一只小狗、退出足球或参加 Niall Horan 见面会时，他们可以为父母<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/style/kids-who-use-powerpoint-to-ask-for-things.html">做 PowerPoint 演示</a>。如果 PowerPoint 是邪恶的，那么邪恶就统治了世界。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">至少从表面上看</span>，PowerPoint 让我们变得愚蠢的想法看起来像是教科书上误导性的技术末日论案例。当我要求塔夫特重新审视他的批评时，他表示反对，但在后来的谈话中，我更直接地向他询问了这个问题：他自己对一项新技术的批评是否有可能没有达到目标，就像过去许多其他人所做的那样？对 PowerPoint 的担忧与对印刷机或<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2010/12/will_the_word_p.php">文字处理器</a>的担忧有什么不同吗？<br><br>在我把这个想法说完之前，他插嘴了。他明显恼怒地说道，这个问题无法回答。 “我不做大的思考，大的废话，”他告诉我。 “我就在战壕里，正在进行沟通。”我认为他的意思是他不参与任何形式的远程抽象历史思考。<br><br>我尝试缩小问题范围。我说，今天对社交媒体的担忧与 PowerPoint 的批评有一定的相似之处。两者都归结为一种担忧，即新媒体技术重视形式而不是实质，它们的设计目的是吸引我们的注意力而不是传达真理，而且它们让我们变得愚蠢。有没有可能——有没有可能——塔夫特做出了正确的批评，但却批评了错误的技术？他没有这样的感觉。他说，PowerPoint 和社交媒体之间的比较是“挥手、胡说和机会主义”。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/07/social-media-harm-facebook-meta-response/670975/">阅读：是的，社交媒体确实正在破坏民主</a><br><br>尽管有这样的驳回，我们还是很容易会产生反事实，并想知道如果塔夫特和我们其他人早在 2003 年就担心社交媒体而不是演示软件，事情会如何发展。也许一本关于<em>Friendster 认知风格的</em>及时小册子或<em>断言</em>“LinkedIn 是邪恶的”的《连线》头条会改变历史的进程。如果过去几年社交媒体的强烈抵制从一开始就存在，也许 Facebook 永远不会成长为现在这样的庞然大物，这个国家也永远不会变得如此绝望的分裂。<br><br>或者也可能什么都不会改变。无论他们的时机如何，也无论他们的适应性如何，对新媒体的担忧似乎很少产生影响。反对意见遭到压制。新技术占据了主导地位。多年后，当我们回顾过去并想，<em>我们如此不安是多么奇怪</em>，这项技术的影响很可能是看不见的。<br><br>书面文字是否摧毁了我们的记忆？广播是否缩短了我们的注意力范围？ PowerPoint 是否让我们变成了企业官僚？如果这些创新确实改变了我们的思维方式，那么我们就会用改变的思维来衡量它们的影响。这些批评要么是错误的，要么是正确的，以至于我们无法再区分。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 23 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scarsdale-new-york-east-coast-richest-town-photo-tour-2019-3">最富有的</a>社区之一，其居民确实是自由派。 2020 年，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/new-york/">四分之三</a>的斯卡斯代尔选民将选票投给了乔·拜登，而不是唐纳德·特朗普。人们可以有把握地推测，很少有斯卡斯代尔居民是特朗普在墨西哥边境修建隔离墙的热心支持者。但他们中的许多人支持一种不太明显的隔离墙，这种隔离墙是根据分区法规建立的，禁止多户住宅，并将非富人（其中许多是有色人种）排除在社区之外。<br><br>在全国范围内，许多优秀的白人自由主义者，他们购买<em>《白人脆弱性》</em>的副本并谴责美国最高法院终止平权行动，每天晚上都睡在专属郊区，这些郊区通过政府法令对经济（从而种族）隔离进行社会设计。高档城市和较贫困的邻居之间的巨大不平等并不是凭空出现的；它们在很大程度上是法律的产物，这些法律很难与许多受过高等教育的深蓝色郊区草坪上的包容性<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/arts/in-this-house-yard-signs.html">“在这所房子里，我们相信”的标志相一致</a>。<br><br>在世纪基金会的一份<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tcf.org/content/report/how-zoning-drives-educational-inequality-the-case-of-westchester-county/">新报告</a>中，我将斯卡斯代尔与另一个韦斯特切斯特县郊区切斯特港进行了对比，后者仅距八英里，但人口统计数据却截然不同。斯卡斯代尔的家庭收入中位数超过<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/scarsdalevillagenewyork/PST045222">25 万美元</a>，几乎是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/portchestervillagenewyork/PST045222">切斯特港</a>的三倍，拥有大学学位的居民比例也是如此。切斯特港四分之三的小学生有资格在学校享受免费或减价餐，而斯卡斯代尔的学生则只有零。在斯卡斯代尔，87% 的居民是非西班牙裔白人或亚裔美国人，而切斯特港 69% 的居民是黑人或西班牙裔。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/black-families-leaving-cities-suburbs/671331/">耶路撒冷德姆萨斯：是什么导致了黑人的逃亡？</a><br><br>在斯卡斯代尔的绝大多数土地上，建造除单户住宅以外的任何东西都是非法的。根据纽约大学弗曼中心为该报告收集的数据，斯卡斯代尔的地块中只有 0.2% 的建筑被归类为两户或三户住宅或公寓。相比之下，切斯特港大约一半的土地允许建造多户住宅。从 2014 年到 2021 年，切斯特港批准的新住房单元中有 41% 是多户住宅。在斯卡斯代尔，获批的 218 个单元中没有一个是多户住宅。当斯卡斯代尔提议建造多户住宅时，居民提出了许多反对意见，其中许多是虚假的。例如，一些人反对公寓，理由是多户住宅会导致学校过度拥挤，尽管数据显示近年来斯卡斯代尔村的入学率一直在下降。<br><br>事实上，许多为孩子寻求更好生活的人都希望有机会搬到斯卡斯代尔。在我为我的新书<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/excluded-how-snob-zoning-nimbyism-and-class-bias-build-the-walls-we-don-t-see-richard-d-kahlenberg/9781541701465?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《排除：势利分区、邻避主义和阶级偏见如何筑起我们看不到的围墙》</em></a>进行的采访中，来自全国各地的低薪单亲母亲反复表达了她们希望为孩子提供更好的学校的愿望。<br><br>正如我在世纪基金会报告中指出的那样，2020 年斯卡斯代尔在每个学生上的支出比切斯特港多了近 5,500 美元，并且学生与教师的比例较低。 2019 年，切斯特港 32% 的学生英语成绩达到年级水平，而斯卡斯代尔的这一比例为 87%，差距高达 55 个百分点。在数学方面，切斯特港学生有 35% 的成绩达到年级水平，而斯卡斯代尔学生的这一比例为 90%，差距也为 55 分。研究<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tcf.org/content/report/housing-policy-school-policy-economically-integrative-housing-promotes-academic-success-montgomery-county-maryland/">表明</a>，当低收入学生有机会进入贫困程度较低的学校时，他们可以在五到七年的时间内将与中产阶级同龄人在数学方面的成绩差距缩小一半，在阅读方面的成绩差距缩小三分之一。他们只是很少有选择。<br><br>电视摄像机有助于描绘在边境被拒之门外的移民家庭的困境，但它们并没有捕捉到切斯特港等地的工薪阶层家庭被排除在斯卡斯代尔等地机会较高的公立学校之外的情况，这些学校禁止建造弱势家庭能够负担得起的房屋类型。尽管斯卡斯代尔的家长可能会试图通过支持切斯特港等地增加国家教育支出来调和排斥与他们的政治自由主义之间的关系， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tcf.org/content/report/bold-agenda-school-integration/">但人们发现</a>学校的经济一体化比“分开但平等”的补偿性支出方法更有效。<br><br>通过限制住房供应，斯卡斯代尔的分区法以及纽约市其他郊区的类似规则也人为推高了大都市区的房价。今年早些时候，纽约州州长凯西·霍赫尔 (Kathy Hochul) 提出了《纽约住房契约》(New York Housing Compact)，该契约将为威彻斯特县等州下城市制定每三年将住房供应量增加 3% 的目标。如果社区未能实现这些目标，州政府将要求市政当局为住房许可证申请人提供快速审批流程。此外，南部地区需要重新规划，以在通勤铁路和地铁站半英里范围内增加住房。目前，在斯卡斯代尔，火车站附近的<a data-event-element="inline

Nolan Gray：取消分区</a><br><br>然而，尽管“在我家后院”的改革在加利福尼亚州、俄勒冈州以及明尼阿波利斯和夏洛特等城市获得了关注，自由派的纽约州立法机构在民选官员和来自富裕的自由派郊区的公民领袖的帮助下，深化了温和的民主党州长的住房议程。斯卡斯代尔民主党人艾米·波林 (Amy Paulin) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/29/nyregion/nyc-suburbs-homes-hochul.html">告诉<em>《纽约时报》</em></a> ，霍赫尔的“提议将以一种没有意义的方式改变我们县的复杂性。”与此同时，威彻斯特县州参议院民主党领袖安德里亚·斯图尔特-考辛斯(Andrea Stewart-Cousins)拒绝了霍赫尔的计划，并呼吁采取财政激励措施，鼓励社区自愿允许提供更多住房。<br><br>富裕的保守地区也对新住房设置了障碍，但自由地区的情况通常更糟。布鲁金斯学会研究员珍妮·舒茨 (Jenny Schuetz) 在 2022 年撰文<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/books/fixer-upper/">指出</a>，“经济学家和城市规划者数十年来对分区的潜心研究，已经就美国哪些地方拥有严格的土地使用法规达成了高度共识，无论衡量分区的方法如何。”她认为，“过度限制性的分区在西海岸和从华盛顿特区到波士顿的东北走廊地区最为普遍，也存在问题。”这些地区“在国家、州和地方选举中严重倾向于民主党”。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0094119010000720">研究</a>各州（例如加利福尼亚州）内分区的严格性的研究发现，限制性最强的分区出现在政治上较为自由的社区。<br><br>在波士顿郊区马萨诸塞州列克星敦，家庭收入中位数为 203,000 美元，选民支持拜登的比例为 81% 对 17%，排斥之墙非常陡峭。想要建造三层公寓的开发商需要至少 15,500 英尺的土地——是邻近沃尔瑟姆最小地块面积的两倍以上（收入中位数为 103,000 美元）。据波士顿大学三名研究人员统计，沃尔瑟姆的建筑商必须遵守 17 项规定，而列克星敦的建筑商则面临 34 项规定。<br><br>新泽西州普林斯顿的选民以六比一的优势支持拜登，政治学家奥马尔·瓦索（Omar Wasow） <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/08/01/us/white-liberals-hypocrisy-race-blake/index.html">尖刻地观察到</a>，“普林斯顿镇的一些人会在自家前草坪上挂上“黑人生命也是命”的标语，并挂上写着‘我们爱我们的穆斯林邻居’的标语，但反对改变分区政策，即每栋房子必须拥有一英亩半的土地。”他继续说：“这意味着，‘我们爱我们的穆斯林邻居，只要他们是百万富翁。’”（拥有少量富有的有色人种邻居可能会让享有特权的白人房主相信这个制度是公正的。）<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/05/zoning-laws-nuclear-modern-family-definition/674117/">阅读：与朋友同住在技术上是非法的</a><br><br>富裕郊区保持排他性的努力可能会失败。 2019 年 6 月，俄勒冈州成为第一个在全州<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2019/07/01/737798440/oregon-legislature-votes-to-essentially-ban-single-family-zoning">范围内颁布虚拟单户住宅分区条例</a>的州。这项改革的发生只是因为农村共和党人往往对政府土地使用法规（以及自由派精英）持怀疑态度，他们与城市民主党人一起击败了富裕的郊区利益集团。 2021 年 9 月，加利福尼亚州的一个类似联盟重复了这一壮举，将全州范围内的复式住宅<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/26/business/california-duplex-senate-bill-9.html">合法化</a>，并允许人们细分地块，这可能意味着以前是单户住宅的地块上可以有多达四套住宅。一位住房专家<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/08/business/economy/california-housing.html">告诉《<em>泰晤士报》</em></a> ，此类法律“开放了基本上被隔离的整个社区”。<br><br>对于一个几十年来邻避部队可靠地赢得政治斗争的国家来说，此类法律的通过是一个惊人的发展。它表明，持续了这么长时间并造成如此大破坏的分区墙正变得越来越难以防御。在修剪整齐的草坪上张贴欢迎标语是不够的。如果富裕的自由派郊区居民相信其他人应该有机会改善自己的生活，那么他们能做的最重要的事情就是允许中等收入的家庭进入他们的城镇。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 23 Jul 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/wealthy-liberal-suburbs-economic-segregation-scarsdale/674792/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/wealthy-liberal-suburbs-economic-segregation-scarsdale/674792/</item><item><title><![CDATA['Oppenheimer' Nightmares?

In fact, many psychologists used to believe that after young adulthood, people tend to settle into their personality. That&#39;s largely true, Faith writes, but only until a certain point: “More recent studies suggest that something unexpected happens to many people as they reach and pass their 60s: Their personality starts changing again.”<br><br> This finding speaks to the capacity of older people to adapt. But as Faith writes, it also tells us something about the circumstances that many older adults contend with, and how society might better support them. Today&#39;s newsletter will explore some of the more wondrous elements of older age. Aging is not easy, but many older adults speak of their current stage of life with satisfaction and joy. Take the writer Margaret Atwood&#39;s reply to Jennifer Senior asking her how old she feels in her own head:<br><br><p> At 53 you worry about being old compared to younger people. At 83 you enjoy the moment, and time travel here and there in the past 8 decades. You don&#39;t fret about seeming old, because hey, you really are old! You and your friends make Old jokes. You have more fun than at 53, in some ways.

The country&#39;s wage structure is getting more equal, not less.<br><br> Arindrajit Dube, a labor economist studying this “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w31010">unexpected</a> ” phenomenon, told me that the country&#39;s “job ladder” had broken about 20 years ago: Workers in crappy jobs found themselves stuck in those crappy jobs, unable to move up. “Starting around 2018 or 2019, you start to see the tight labor market bring back some health and dynamism,” he told me. “People are making more changes. The Great Resignation, the Great Reshuffle, whatever you want to call it—it means the market is working better. And it&#39;s allowing people to leave jobs that are really bad.” As a result, workers report feeling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.conference-board.org/research/job-satisfaction/US-worker-satisfaction-continues-to-increase">more satisfied</a> with their jobs now than at any point since the 1980s, and 4 million more people have full-time jobs (and 1.6 million fewer people have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/juliaonjobs/status/1678747214594678784">part-time jobs</a> ) than before the pandemic.<br><br> Improvements in earnings, along with the stimulus payments the government made during the pandemic, have helped lift millions of families out of poverty. The child-poverty rate has fallen from 12.5 percent to just 5.2 percent over the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-277.pdf">past three years</a> . That&#39;s the lowest level ever recorded. The share of people living in deep poverty and near-poverty has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2022/demo/p60-277.pdf">declined, too</a> , and food insecurity is at its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/ag-and-food-statistics-charting-the-essentials/food-security-and-nutrition-assistance/#:~:text=In%202021%2C%2089.8%20percent%20of,had%20very%20low%20food%20security.">lowest-ever rate</a> .<br><br> Bigger paychecks are helping middle-class families buy houses and build wealth. The homeownership rate was increasing faster <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nar.realtor/newsroom/u-s-homeownership-rate-experiences-largest-annual-increase-on-record-though-black-homeownership-remains-lower-than-decade-ago">than it ever had</a> , until interest rates spiked a year ago; families in the lower half of the income distribution are more likely to own their homes now than at any point <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/housing/hvs/data/histtabs.html">since the real-estate bubble</a> burst in 2006. Most Millennials own <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.apartmentlist.com/research/millennial-homeownership-2023">property</a> ; the generation is starting to catch up with Gen Xers and Boomers in terms of net worth and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/blog/surge-household-growth-and-what-it-suggests-about-future-housing-demand">household formation</a> .<br><br> The economy has also delivered extraordinary gains for Black Americans. The jobless rate for Black workers is near <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006">a historic low</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LNS14000006#0">the gap between</a> the unemployment rate for white workers and Black workers is the smallest it has ever been. Black workers&#39; earnings are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/LEU0252884600Q">increasing rapidly</a> too.<br><br> Measured in all sorts of more esoteric ways, American families are doing the best they ever have. The delinquency rate on loans is the lowest it <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DRALACBN">has ever been</a> . Real disposable income is the highest it has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/A229RX0A048NBEA">ever been</a> . The personal-bankruptcy rate is at an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://finmasters.com/personal-bankruptcy-statistics/#gref">all-time low</a> .<br><br> So we have to ask: Why aren&#39;t we partying like it&#39;s 1999?<br><br> The most immediate answer is inflation. It is not only sapping folks&#39; paychecks (though earnings and disposable income are still up in inflation-adjusted terms). People just hate having to do mental math every time they fill up their tank or hit the grocery store. And consumers tend not to notice when things get better as opposed to worse: Inflation has cooled off considerably, and the prices of eggs, gas, used cars, plane tickets, and dozens of other common <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm">consumer goods</a> are falling, but that fact has not seeped in for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/1675/most-important-problem.aspx">many families</a> .<br><br> Then there is something I like to call the Wrong-Apartment Problem. The country&#39;s big cities have added far too few housing units over the past few decades; now even rural areas have shortages. By <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/us-housing-gap-cost-affordability-big-cities/672184/">one estimate</a> , roughly half of Americans would live somewhere different if supply met demand; New York would be eight times as big as it is now, and San Francisco five times as big. Renters <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.anderson.ucla.edu/documents/areas/ctr/ziman/ConfAfford2015_Albouy-Ehrlich-Liu_Housing-Demand-Expenditures2_09.09.15.pdf">spend</a> a larger share of their income on housing than they did in 1999, and rents <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.moodys.com/web/en/us/about/insights/data-stories/us-rental-housing-affordability.html">have grown</a> by 135 percent, whereas average incomes have grown just 77 percent. The country has an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/great-affordability-crisis-breaking-america/606046/">affordability crisis</a> , with health care, child care, and rent eating up huge shares of family budgets.<br><br> Yet these statistics still <i>underplay</i> just how bad the situation is. People don&#39;t spend what they can&#39;t afford, and pretty much nobody can afford what they want anymore. Yes, we have more income, more disposable cash, and a better standard of living than at any other point in our history. But millions of us can&#39;t live in the neighborhoods we want. We&#39;re stuck in too-small, too-far-away accommodations, giving up on the dream of having a second bathroom or a third kid. This is why you get all the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/LifesNotFoehr/status/1676341223349534721">social-media nostalgia</a> for the economic conditions of the 1950s, when many Americans still lacked <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/coh-plumbing.html">indoor plumbing</a> , but at least could live in Brooklyn or Somerville or San Francisco on a reasonable salary. We&#39;re all stuck in the Wrong Apartment.<br><br> A third major element is inequality. Although lower-income Americans have begun narrowing the gap, that&#39;s a very recent phenomenon. And the incomes of the very richest are <i>still</i> rising faster than anybody else&#39;s. Even if living standards are improving, the sense that the gains aren&#39;t being equally shared is noxious to our polity.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/bidenomics-economic-pessimism/674701/">James Surowiecki: The bad-vibes economy</a><br><br> The political and media environments are surely factors as well. Today&#39;s intense polarization pushes folks to hate the economy if they hate the president and love the economy if they love the president, meaning that Republicans just aren&#39;t happy right now. “Partisan bias exerts a significant influence on survey measures of economic expectations, and this bias is increasing,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://direct.mit.edu/rest/article/105/3/493/100979/Partisan-Bias-Economic-Expectations-and-Household">new research finds</a> . Switch on the TV, and the world is a bummer, too: the climate catastrophe, war in Europe, threats to democracy at home, social-media frying our brains and ruining <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/12/the-sex-recession/573949/">sex</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/culture/2023/02/hanging-out-sheila-liming-book-friendship-crisis.html">hanging out</a> , among other pleasures.

He was impossibly frugal with himself: frayed canvas shoes and a tattered windbreaker for all seasons. He abhorred wastefulness. He would put down the phone when solicitors called. But the entreaties for money that flooded his mailbox, including many from firefighter, law-enforcement, and veterans&#39; funds, typically wound up on his desk. Often, generosity eclipsed suspicion, meaning that he sent out a lot of smallish checks. This despite his telling me, in his early 90s, “I suspect they sell your information and then everyone asks you for money.”<br><br> The checks my father wrote did him no harm, but knowing when it&#39;s safe to give away money is not easy. This is just one aspect of an important yet overlooked threat to older adults: financial exploitation. It can take many forms. Fundraising requests that seem legitimate might cross the line into excessive pressure. Sometimes existing relationships, such as with an accountant, turn predatory. Family members and friends, too, take financial advantage of older people in their life. Then there are strangers who devise outright scams to prey on aging Americans, posing as charities, relatives, even potential romantic partners.<br><br> I was introduced to these issues as a civil-fraud prosecutor and in launching an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/elderjustice">initiative</a> at the Department of Justice focused on protecting older people. After I left DOJ, my research, including for my book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-measure-of-our-age-navigating-care-safety-money-and-meaning-later-in-life-m-t-connolly/9781541702721"><em>The Measure of Our Age</em></a> , revealed to me the often invisible harms that older adults can face when targeted for their money.<br><br> We don&#39;t know the full scale of the problem. But we do know that victims of financial exploitation are disproportionately over the age of 60; people in their 70s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/data-visualizations/data-spotlight/2022/12/who-experiences-scams-story-all-ages">report</a> higher median losses than their younger counterparts, and people 80 and older report the highest median losses of all. Estimates for the cumulative amount of money lost annually to elder financial exploitation vary widely—from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/protecting-older-consumers-2020-2021-report-federal-trade-commission/protecting-older-consumers-report-508.pdf">hundreds</a> of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/file/1523276/download">millions</a> to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://states.aarp.org/colorado/aarp-report-28-3-billion-a-year-stolen-from-adults-60#:~:text=Older%20Americans%20lose%20an%20estimated,report%20these%20incidents%20to%20authorities.">tens</a> of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/advisory/2022-06-15/FinCEN%20Advisory%20Elder%20Financial%20Exploitation%20FINAL%20508.pdf">billions</a> of dollars. The numbers are hard to pin down in part because people over 60 are less likely to report fraud in the first place. What&#39;s clear is that the pool of potential targets is getting bigger: People 85 and older are the fastest-growing segment of the US population, slated to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://acl.gov/sites/default/files/aging%20and%20Disability%20In%20America/2020Profileolderamericans.final_.pdf">more than double</a> from 6.6 million in 2019 to 14.4 million in 2040. Our society is not remotely prepared to protect this growing demographic group from financial exploitation.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/07/old-age-personality-brain-changes-psychology/674668/">Read: The curious personality changes of older age</a><br><br> Being exploited is obviously an injustice in its own right. But less obvious are the extent and gravity of the harm that these incidents inflict on older adults. Some victims lose their houses or treasured belongings such as wedding rings, or can no longer pay for care they need. Some cower in their own homes, fearing theft and threats by family members seeking funds to support a drug addiction. The financial loss can compound and hasten declines in physical and mental health, tipping lives from independence to dependence.<br><br> Mark Lachs, a co-chief of geriatrics and palliative medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College, has found that elder mistreatment, including financial exploitation,<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/187817">triples</a> rates of premature mortality and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/42/6/734/671735">quadruples</a> nursing-home admissions among victims. Falling for a scam, regardless of one&#39;s age, can usher in embarrassment, hopelessness, and dread— <em>How could I have been so stupid?</em> —and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.finrafoundation.org/sites/finrafoundation/files/non-traditional-costs-financial-fraud.pdf">cause severe stress</a> or even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2022/mental-health-impact.html">sometimes lead to suicide</a> . Think of the impact on older people like Jenga late in the game: There are wobbles, but the tower still stands. Then some event yanks out a crucial block, toppling the structure.<br><br> When an older person&#39;s assets are stolen, others also suffer. Adult children might lose a family home, see their inheritance dwindle, or be thrust into caregiving. Trying to protect an older person from exploitation and other mistreatment can cause significant distress for concerned relatives or friends who want to help.<br><br> Anyone can become the victim of financial exploitation, but cognitive impairment increases <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/biomedgerontology/article/72/10/1365/3091724?login=false">risk</a> . As memory and executive function decline with age, so too can <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sifma.org/resources/news/financial-capacity-and-financial-exploitation/">financial capacity</a> , the ability to, for example, pay bills or manage assets. In some people, financial capacity <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2773241">declines</a> long before any diagnosis of dementia. When someone calls unexpectedly to ask for money, our brain parses thousands of social cues. “Gut feelings,” in fact emanating from the brain&#39;s anterior insula, send <em>Something&#39;s not right here!</em> signals. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-older-adults-are-too-trusting/">Aging can dim those signals</a> , or mute them altogether, making some older people less suspicious. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25663/social-isolation-and-loneliness-in-older-adults-opportunities-for-the">Isolation</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/aging/publications/features/lonely-older-adults.html">loneliness</a> , epidemics among older Americans, also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7741502/">exacerbate risk</a> .<br><br> The most egregious scams rely on countless fictions, which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/07/21/zients-biden-ai-authority">artificial intelligence</a> and other technologies will make only more real-seeming. Con artists might impersonate a cop, a lawyer, or hospital staff reporting a fake emergency to trigger fear. Being “Grandma&#39;ed” has entered the lexicon to describe people getting calls to help a supposed grandchild in crisis who needs cash right away. The government reported a surge in scammers demanding money to resolve false Social Security–related <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ssa.gov/scam/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwnrmlBhDHARIsADJ5b_lXllU50W31c63vnspiWyDYOrzlxVFS0f-LsmshOVXJY_nOJMqfKSMaAkBVEALw_wcB">problems</a> in 2019 and 2020; the greater the victim&#39;s age, the more money they lost. “Romance” frauds, also known as “sweetheart” scams, are the type of stranger scheme to which people 60 and older <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/reports/protecting-older-consumers-2020-2021-report-federal-trade-commission/protecting-older-consumers-report-508.pdf">lose the most money</a> . Many con artists use religious dating sites such as BigChurch, Christian Mingle, and Jdate to find people who can&#39;t imagine that they might be swindled by someone who shares their faith.<br><br> Some scammers targeting the elderly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aarp.org/money/scams-fraud/info-2019/veterans-charity.html">pose</a> as charitable organizations. But even development professionals from real and respected institutions—universities, advocacy organizations, cultural groups, political entities—might not stop to consider whether a potential donor has financial capacity and thus whether aggressively pushing them to give is ethical or fair.<br><br> Then there are people who start out in legitimate roles but become predators. Ron Long, who co-founded a Wells Fargo Advisors initiative to train employees to detect and respond to elder exploitation, told me about a hairdresser who had become both power of attorney and sole beneficiary for several wealthy clients. Lawyers, brokers—virtually anyone in whom an elder places trust—can veer toward deception. “All it takes,” Long said, “is for one person who knows their financial and cognitive situation to be dishonest.”<br><br> Sherrie Kaplan, an assistant vice chancellor at UC Irvine&#39;s medical school, told me about how her late mother was exploited through a home-repair project. Despite having heart disease and mild dementia, and having lost her husband, Kaplan&#39;s mother had done well living on her own. Then her bathtub backed up. Not wanting to burden her children, she picked a plumber from the phone book. The initial estimate of $800 ballooned to more than $8,000. The job grew too. Suddenly men were digging up her driveway. Then came dunning calls and workers banging on her door demanding payment. She didn&#39;t tell her kids for fear that they&#39;d think she couldn&#39;t live alone anymore. Instead, feeling scared and ashamed that she had been taken advantage of, she stopped going out, missed doctors&#39; appointments, and didn&#39;t refill her prescriptions. Then her heart failed, requiring emergency cardiac surgery. She never totally recovered, losing not just her money but likely years of her life.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/03/older-adults-covid-health-quality-of-life/673507/">Read: Life is worse for older people now</a><br><br> Family members can present some of the greatest financial threats to older adults: People who exploit their older relatives are estimated to steal on average <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/cfpb_suspicious-activity-reports-elder-financial-exploitation_report.pdf">two and a half times as much as strangers</a> in each instance. In family settings, the symbolic freight that money carries can contribute to conflict and exploitation. Some family members might feel entitled to take an older relative&#39;s money with justifications such as “I&#39;ll get it anyway,” “I&#39;ve earned it,” or “I need it more.”<br><br> Page Ulrey, a Seattle elder-abuse prosecutor whose work I&#39;ve chronicled for more than a decade, told me that most of her family-exploitation cases are fueled by gambling and shopping addictions, such as with two sisters who pleaded guilty to theft after wiping out more than $85,000 of their mom&#39;s savings, including “by gambling at casinos and bingeing on crappy Home Shopping Network jewelry.” Long told me that many cases identified by Wells Fargo Advisors have involved daughters, who tend to handle the bulk of the care for their aging parents. “Then if Mom says she&#39;s dividing up her estate even stephen among the siblings, the daughter thinks, <em>That&#39;s not fair. I&#39;ve been doing all the work</em> ,” he said. “It doesn&#39;t justify exploitation, but she has a point.”<br><br> There&#39;s still much more to learn about precisely which older Americans are most likely to be victimized, but data suggest that older people of color lose more than their white counterparts. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/50/6/744/629839">One study</a> found that 23 percent of older African Americans were financially exploited, about three times the rate of non–African Americans. And a small <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3396729/#:~:text=The%20promotores%20conducted%20door%2Dto,neglect%20within%20the%20previous%20year.">pilot study</a> of low-income Latinos in Los Angeles found that four in 10 reported being victimized by elder neglect or abuse, including financial exploitation. (Dementia rates are slightly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cuimc.columbia.edu/news/one-10-older-americans-has-dementia">higher</a> among people of color and those with less education.)<br><br> The wealthy are not immune: The son of the New York philanthropist Brooke Astor was convicted of grand larceny for giving himself a retroactive $1 million “raise” for wielding power of attorney for his cognitively impaired mother. But the losses are usually more precarious for those with fewer means. Keren Wilson, an assisted-living pioneer, aging expert, and coal miner&#39;s daughter, called me a few years ago, troubled by what she was seeing in McDowell County, West Virginia. Crime spiked just after the Social Security checks arrived, she said, and elders facing serious pain and end-of-life declined hospice services, fearing that if word got out that they had painkillers in the house, they&#39;d be robbed.<br><br> Although our society has some mechanisms in place to tackle this complex social problem, they aren&#39;t nearly adequate. As with many other aspects of aging, we focus disproportionately on reacting <em>after</em> crises strike.我们几乎没有采取任何措施来加深对防止老年人遭受经济剥削的措施的理解。 This subject deserves more consideration and conversation, both in families and among policy makers.<br><br> Some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/elderjustice/prosecutors/statutes?field_statute_state=NY&amp;field_statute_category=All">states</a> have criminalized various types of exploitative conduct and deemed certain older victims to be “vulnerable” to allow for enhanced penalties. But I have been unable to find any evidence that such measures prevent or reduce financial loss. Although there are cases deserving of prosecution, when a family member is the alleged perpetrator, the victim might be reluctant to seek help because they don&#39;t want a loved one to face criminal punishment. Organizations such as the FTC and AARP regularly publish <em>Look out for this one!</em> lists and guidance about new scams.

Trade-union leaders and CEOs strategized instead of shouting at one another, and the success of German industry offered an unsullied source of pride. So did the fiscal conservatism and hawkish monetary policy that allowed the Federal Republic to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/mb201005en_pp99-110en.pdf">master</a> high inflation in the 1970s and &#39;80s better than the rest of Europe and the United States were able to.<br><br> Economic success provided Germany not only with a postwar identity but also with the power of attraction. During the Cold War, the promise of a freer, better life in the Federal Republic prompted East Germans to flee the Communist German Democratic Republic. When they toppled the Berlin Wall in November 1989, East Berliners first <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.welt.de/politik/20-jahre-mauerfall/article5141880/Kollektives-Tagebuch-Donnerstag-9-November-89.html">stormed</a> Kurfürstendamm, the shopping street and temple of capitalism they had fantasized about but had never gotten to see. German leaders relied on the country&#39;s economic might to power reunification, co-build the European Union, and welcome Syrians escaping civil war in 2015.<br><br> Just three decades after reunification, per capita GDP in the former GDR<i> </i>is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/4187653/11571499/GDP_per_capita_ver3-01.jpg">higher</a> than in many regions in northern France. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://data.oecd.org/unemp/unemployment-rate.htm">Unemployment</a> , at 2.9 percent, is well below the US or EU average, even though Germany took in a million Syrians in 2015 and another million Ukrainians in 2022. Berlin remains the biggest financial contributor to the EU—the organization Paris initially designed to keep post–Nazi Germany in check but that has now made war between its 27 members close to unthinkable.<br><br> Yet an economy, even Germany&#39;s, is a slender thread on which to hang a national identity. When France struggles with unemployment, the French still have the revolutionary myth of 1789 and the Eiffel Tower. When Greece is on the brink of default, the Greeks still have Plato and olive trees. When the United States skirts another financial crisis, there is still the American dream and Beyoncé.

In fact, German GDP has roughly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=12p4H">stagnated</a> since 2019. And German manufacturing is the main problem: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://think.ing.com/snaps/german-ip-april-070623/">Industrial output</a> lags pre-pandemic levels by some 5 percent.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/03/germany-putin-ukraine-invasion/623322/">Read: Europe&#39;s sleeping giant awakens</a><br><br> If you ask Berlin who is to blame, there seems to be just one answer: high energy prices sparked by Russia&#39;s war against Ukraine. The AfD and far-left Die Linke are nostalgic for cheap Russian gas, while the opposing center-right CDU and the governing pro-business FDP blame the Greens for insisting on turning off the country&#39;s last nuclear-power plants this spring. Scholz decided to turbocharge renewables investment, and no one in Berlin expects the government to push back the exit from coal energy from 2030 to 2038, as initially planned.<br><br> But high energy prices are not the only drag on the economy, nor are they new. German electricity prices have run significantly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://strom-report.com/strompreise-europa/">above</a> the European average for at least a decade, and Russian gas was never really cheap, especially if you compare it with US fracking gas.<br><br> The reason Germany ceased to be Europe&#39;s growth engine has less to do with Russian energy than with changing circumstances in the export markets where the country&#39;s industrial champions once flourished. In the 2000s, former Chancellor Gerhard Schröder slashed unemployment benefits and created a low-wage sector to help German exporters increase their market shares across Europe. Since then, many other European countries, including France and Italy, have made reforms to cut labor costs themselves, and Germany faces tougher competition in its biggest export market and has been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php?oldid=452727#Evolution_of_intra-EU_trade_in_goods">running a trade deficit in goods</a> with other EU members since 2020.<br><br> Outside the EU, “made in Germany” goods struggle to find new clients. Exports to China have been roughly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Brad_Setser/status/1586421747934531585?s=20">flat</a> since mid-2015 and may even start to drop, as President Xi Jinping has made clear that he wants to make his country less dependent on European industry. German car exports to China were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.destatis.de/EN/Press/2023/05/PE23_182_51.html">down</a> 24 percent in the first three months of 2023 compared with the same period in 2022. The US is Germany&#39;s second-largest market after the EU, accounting for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://santandertrade.com/en/portal/analyse-markets/germany/foreign-trade-in-figures">8.9</a> percent of its exports, but to top off Germany&#39;s troubles, Washington is becoming more protectionist under Joe Biden. The Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, includes purchase subsidies for electric vehicles that primarily benefit buyers of cars produced in North America.<br><br> So what can Berlin do if exports won&#39;t be driving German growth anymore?<br><br> The obvious solution is for Germany to spend more. Greater investment could raise productivity in a country where <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reisereporter.de/reisenews/deutsche-bahn-ist-im-europa-vergleich-am-unpuenktlichsten-3FRLA33QE6JC5ITOS6Z3JBC3X5.html">the railways</a> have the worst delays among major European countries and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.smartdroid.de/im-eu-vergleich-landen-deutsche-handynetze-weit-hinten/">cellphone</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/224924/umfrage/internet-verbindungsgeschwindigkeit-in-ausgewaehlten-weltweiten-laendern/">internet connectivity</a> are underfunded and therefore <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/224924/umfrage/internet-verbindungsgeschwindigkeit-in-ausgewaehlten-weltweiten-laendern/">patchy</a> . Investment could boost demand, and liberalizing policies could rebalance the economy toward services. But a dogma of balanced budgets and debt avoidance remains deeply anchored among German politicians and voters.<br><br> Germans don&#39;t seem to feel much urgency around these questions at the moment. Unemployment is still low. In Mannheim, students are out and about, enjoying spaghetti ice cream, the local speciality, priced at €5.80, while the once slightly rundown Berlin Ku&#39;damm feels more and more like the manicured Avenue Montaigne in Paris. In March this year, Chancellor Scholz even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.t-online.de/nachrichten/deutschland/innenpolitik/id_100141426/olaf-scholz-rechnet-neuem-wirtschaftswunder-in-deutschland.html">said</a> the country will soon see a new “ <i>Wirtschaftswunder</i> ”—Germany&#39;s age of postwar growth—a prediction that should leave any economist gasping.<br><br> In short, the penny has not yet dropped. Germany&#39;s political elite hasn&#39;t been moved to take the risky step of running up debts and liberalizing at the same time. But until it does, the country&#39;s economy will likely lag European growth. And if the economy ceases to serve as a source of national pride, political forces may thrive by brandishing more nativist concepts of German identity.<br><br> M <span class="smallcaps">ore and more</span> governments across Europe are led by right-wing parties: in Italy, Sweden, Finland, and soon possibly Spain. In all of these countries, the center-right no longer has qualms about working with the far-right. Now Germany, whose effort to confront its Nazi history seemed to inoculate its politicians from having to deal with a large far-right party, is also falling prey to populism and nationalism.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/09/germany-election-afd-far-right/620114/">Read: What Germany says about far-right politics</a><br><br> The AfD&#39;s rise to 20 percent in the polls—twice what it commanded in the 2021 parliamentary elections—has many causes. The party&#39;s bastion is the formerly Communist east, where authoritarian attitudes and resentment of traditional parties <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1467-923X.12859">feed</a> off of feelings of having been the losers in Germany&#39;s reunification. But something broader is going on. For Germans, the hallmark of good government is “ <i>Ruhe und Ordnung</i> ,” calm and order. The three parties in Scholz&#39;s ruling coalition—the center-left SPD, the Greens, and the pro-business FDP—squabble over everything, including whether to ban gas heating systems, how to deal with China, and whether to raise the child-benefits system. The result is neither calm nor order, at a time when inflation and the energy crisis are already destabilizing life in Germany.<br><br> The party has also benefited from a backlash against Germany&#39;s progressive agenda on climate and migration. Despite the country&#39;s reputation abroad as a climate champion, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/may/02/many-europeans-want-climate-action-but-less-so-if-it-changes-their-lifestyle-shows-poll">in a poll of seven European countries</a> , Germans were the least willing among Europeans to switch to electric cars, cut meat consumption, or spend out of their own pockets to renovate their houses to save the climate.<br><br> As for migration, racist views are ingrained in Germany&#39;s formerly Communist east, where more than 28 percent of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.juedische-allgemeine.de/politik/starke-partei/">survey</a> respondents agreed that “Jews have something special and idiosyncratic” and “don&#39;t really fit with us,” and roughly 20 percent said that the crimes of the Nazi regime had been grossly exaggerated. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dw.com/en/half-of-eastern-germans-want-authoritarian-rule/a-66068519#:~:text=Islamophobia%2C%20antisemitism%20and%20xenophobia%20are,a%20%22strong%20party%22%20leadership.">Half</a> of those surveyed wanted a ban on Muslim immigration. But the AfD has also been able to mobilize an anti-immigration electorate in big, rich, formerly West German states, such as Bavaria, the land of Siemens and <i>Weisswurst</i> , and Baden-Württemberg, home to Mercedes and <i>Spätzle</i> .<br><br> Economic conditions as well as refugee crises likely have something to do with the rightward shift on this issue. In the late 1960s, when West Germany hit its first postwar economic recession and migrants from Southern Europe and Turkey started working in its factories, the neo-Nazi NPD won <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/archiv/1968-04-28-LT-DE-BW/index.shtml">9.8 percent</a> in Baden-Württemberg and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/archiv/1966-11-20-LT-DE-BY/index.shtml">7.4 percent</a> in Bavaria. In the 1990s, when Germany struggled with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://de.statista.com/statistik/daten/studie/1127090/umfrage/arbeitslosenquote-der-bundesrepublik-deutschland/">high</a> unemployment and refugees came from the former Yugoslavia, the far-right <i>Republikaner</i> easily <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tagesschau.de/wahl/archiv/1992-04-05-LT-DE-BW/index.shtml">won</a> 10.9 percent in elections in Baden-Württemberg. Both parties vanished into irrelevance when the center-right CDU shifted its migration policy to the right.<br><br> The eastern states of Thuringia and Saxony will hold elections next year—national elections will follow in 2025—and the CDU will need to decide whether it will continue marginalizing the far-right or start working with it instead. The AfD is leading the polls in Thuringia and polling a strong second in Saxony. The national leader of the CDU, Friedrich Merz, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/germany-conservatives-cdu-merz-migrants-b049e245559f85c318d3f1104bcfb3ab">says</a> he will not work with the AfD, but in Berlin many fear that the local CDU branches in Thuringia and Saxony may decide to do it anyway. Merz cannot prevent this if he does not want to risk splitting the party in two.<br><br> G <span class="smallcaps">ermany is joining</span> the European mainstream, with its political class struggling to counter rising far-right support and an economy that is no longer best-in-class. The two things that made postwar Germany unique in Europe are no more. Even Germany&#39;s football team, second only to the economy as a source of post-1945 national pride, is not what it used to be.<br><br> Germany&#39;s <i>déclassement</i> is a problem for the country itself, but also for the EU. When the bloc&#39;s ancestor, the European Coal and Steel Community, came into being in the 1950s, its raison d&#39;être was to domesticate Germany and stabilize the continent with it. Later, the EU started to rely on Germany as its anchor. The German economy was strong enough to help finance the European project, and its politicians were often far-sighted enough to realize that advancing the EU was in Berlin&#39;s interest.<br><br> Now the rise of the AfD is pushing Berlin to become an unreliable partner in Europe. The CDU was once the champion of Schengen, the EU&#39;s policy to allow for passport-less travel across the continent. The party&#39;s leader, Merz, clearly concerned about covering his right flank, has now <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.berliner-zeitung.de/news/steigende-fluechtlingszahlen-friedrich-merz-fuer-erneute-grenzkontrollen-in-der-eu-li.331394">called</a> for reintroducing passport checks at Germany&#39;s borders with other EU members, such as Czechia, in order to turn away migrants.<br><br> The Scholz government surprised Brussels by torpedoing at the very last minute a decision to ban the sale of combustion-engine cars in Europe as of 2035. The FDP, which was the main force behind this decision, received a much-needed boost in the polls as a result. As the AfD criticizes the “reckless” spending of the Scholz government, the FDP and the chancellor are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-05-23/scholz-plots-20-billion-of-german-budget-cuts-in-snub-to-greens?sref=ojq9DljU">doubling down</a> on spending cuts. Germany is becoming less willing to spend for itself and the EU.<br><br> For a decade, pundits speculated that France, led by Le Pen, would put the European project to its biggest stress test. But instead the German speed car seems ready to cut across France to the chase.<br><br> The AfD may one day accede to national government, but it cannot do so on its own. To work in a coalition, the party will almost certainly have to compromise on its most radical policy propositions, such as closing the US military base in Ramstein. But even with the AfD merely exerting pressure on German politics, the EU must sooner or later face an adjustment—to a future in which Germany is no longer an economic and political anchor so much as a source of instability.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 22 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/germany-national-identity-afd-party-political-instability/674786/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/germany-national-identity-afd-party-political-instability/674786/</item></channel></rss>
