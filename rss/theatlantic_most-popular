<i>《芭比娃娃》</i>终于于本周在影院上映。在舞蹈表演和笑话之间，这部电影邀请我们提出有关女权主义以及商业与艺术之间界限的问题。<br><br>首先，这是来自<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>的三个新故事：<br><br><li> <a

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ozempic-noom-diet-industry/674774/">人们只是想减肥。</a></li><b>芭比娃娃的所有侧面</b><br><br>多年来，芭比扮演了很多角色：高不可攀的美丽标准的象征、职业女性、男性目光的体现、年轻女孩的灵感。这个夏天，<i>芭比娃娃</i>就是一个值得去的地方。昨天下午我在布鲁克林放映的这部电影门票全部售罄，挤满了穿着粉红色衣服的高兴的人。为了了解是什么推动了这部电影在今年夏天的普及，并讨论了这部电影如何处理女权主义主题，我给<i>《大西洋月刊》的</i>文化作家雪莉·李打了电话。<br><br><b>以下内容包含<i>芭比娃娃</i>的轻微剧透。</b><br><br><b>洛拉·凯利：</b>今年夏天我到处都看到了<i>芭比娃娃</i>——在广告牌上、在曼哈顿的一家快闪店里，我的谷歌搜索结果页面上都是粉红色的。对于暑期档大片来说，这样的营销活动正常吗？或者这个项目有什么特别之处吗？<br><br> <b>Shirley Li：</b>这部电影对美泰来说是一个很大的转变。我认为他们已经在营销活动中倾注了一切。美泰多年来一直在与芭比品牌斗争，并正在寻找一种方法来扭转芭比的文化相关性。而芭比娃娃恰好在市场上非常有趣。<br><br>与此同时，这种营销推广，至少对于大型夏季主力来说，是大流行之前的常态。好莱坞的罢工也是一个因素：在上周美国演员工会和美国电视演员工会罢工开始之前，<i>芭比娃娃</i>演员们在新闻发布会上尽其所能地进行了宣传。<br><br> <b>Lora：</b><i>芭比娃娃</i>是美泰的品牌营销作品，还是格蕾塔·葛韦格的艺术品？<br><br><b>雪莉：</b>这是美泰的品牌营销，也是编剧兼导演格蕾塔·葛韦格的艺术作品。这就是我对这部电影感兴趣的原因之一。它非常有自知之明，这是一部关于产品的电影。但它认为芭比不仅是一个产品，而且是一个主角——一个值得她自己的女英雄之旅的人，她的功能是代表一个品牌，同时也代表年轻女孩的女性理想。所有这些都包含在这部电影中。<br><br>这部电影邀请您思考芭比娃娃的方方面面。你不能在不谈论影响你的事情的情况下谈论你自己，而这些事情通常是你消费或购买的东西。我们常常认为，我们之所以成为<i>我们，</i>是因为我们玩、消费、看、听的东西。我们会对这些东西变得非常有占有欲。与此同时，我们并不完全由他们组成。<br><br><b>劳拉：</b>我很好奇你对这是否是一部女权主义电影以及在多大程度上是一部女权主义电影的看法。<br><br><b>雪莉：</b><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6289864/barbie-time-cover-story/">美泰公司的一位高管</a>表示， <i>《芭比娃娃》</i> “不是一部女权主义电影”。玛格特·罗比后来回应了这样的情绪， <i>“你是什么意思？”</i>我认为这是一部女权主义电影，而且我认为它确实试图细致入微地阐述女权主义的含义。早期，芭比娃娃相信她们生活在一个女权主义世界。但他们的女权主义观念是有缺陷的。他们生活在肯斯是二等公民的世界里。没有性别平等。这部电影探讨了许多年轻女孩被出卖的光鲜亮丽的女权主义观念。被告知你可以成为任何人是鼓舞人心的，但这不一定是真的。影片邀请你思考这场辩论，但与此同时，它又是纯粹的女权主义。<br><br><b>洛拉：</b>你今天写了一篇关于亚美莉卡·费雷拉独白的精彩<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">文章</a>，这是电影中引人注目的时刻。关于女性的挑战和矛盾的严肃独白如何融入到一部也有很多舞蹈动作、有趣的服装和火花的电影中？葛韦格成功地调和了这些能量吗？<br><br><b>雪莉：</b>我认为它是成功的，因为我认为发人深省<i>的</i>独白不会以它需要的方式出现在一部更发人深省的电影中。如果这部电影不是那么充满活力、色彩缤纷、夸张的话，那么这段独白就会显得说教。<br><br>格蕾塔·葛韦格所做的就是将这段演讲放入电影的特洛伊木马中。从某种意义上来说，这与亚美莉卡·费雷拉饰演的角色所谈论的经历是真实的。对于女性来说，要想成功，就必须不断地协商自己的权力。就像，你必须强调不要太具有攻击性或威胁性，所以你必须咯咯地笑一下。你必须不断地遵守这些关于女性应该如何行事的期望。让我喜欢这段独白的原因是——即使这个角色所说的事情有点明显——没有什么大的收获。<br><br><b>劳拉：</b>我想问一下，“巴本海默”是从哪里来的？为什么每个人都在谈论<i>芭比</i>和<i>奥本海默</i>背靠背？<br><br><b>雪莉：</b>我最简单的说法是，《巴本海默》是一种现象，源于两部电影在风格、功能和感知目标观众方面截然相反的同时上映。其中一部是一部关于原子弹之父的冷酷、忧郁的传记片，时长三个小时，由典型的男孩电影导演克里斯托弗·诺兰执导。它包含了所有这些对道德、人性和傲慢的重要考虑。另一部电影，至少从它的营销方式来看，是一部由格蕾塔·葛韦格执导的闪闪发光、罂粟花般的欢乐庆典，她的电影很大程度上是关于少女时代和女性气质的。<br><br><i>奥本海默</i>似乎适合那些想要一部关于现实的电影的人，而<i>芭比</i>似乎适合那些只想要幻想的人。我认为这就是为什么人们如此享受将它们混搭并制作关于它们的模因。尽管这两部电影代表了所有的二分性，但我认为它们也有很多共同的主题。他们提出存在主义问题：我们如何交换想法？是什么阻止我们成为最好的自己？是什么让我们成为人类？<br><br><b>有关的：</b><br><br><li>

Tragedy]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>一名男孩在家禽加工厂死亡，标签没有任何反应。 <br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>本·科特/大西洋月刊</figcaption></figure>我<span class="smallcaps">是加州葡萄罢工中的一名儿童兵</span>，我的劳动是在伯克利的沙特克大道合作社外进行的。当时我大约七八岁，在联合农场工人的桌子旁摇晃装满硬币的福杰斯咖啡罐，我母亲每周有两到三个下午驻守在那里。我的大部分工作都是和她一起做的，但每小时有几次我会做儿童兵一直做的事情：以只有很小的人才能做的事情来服务。我会走到停车场，在汽车之间溜走，以确保没有人在不捐赠一些硬币或签署请愿书的情况下逃跑。我会突然出现在驾驶员侧的窗户旁边，使罐子发出剧烈的嘎嘎声。我不是吉米·霍法，但我也没有玩任何游戏。<br><br>我的父母是老派左翼分子，出生于 20 年代，是大萧条时期的孩子。他们永远不会越过纠察线，不会不参加抵制活动，不会在罢工者拿不到薪水时忽视他们对金钱的需求。我的父母永远不会说贫穷是因为缺乏智力或努力造成的。我们不是一个宗教家庭（至少可以这么说），但我有一个教义问答：一个工人是无能为力的；一个工人是无能为力的；一个工人是无能为力的。许多工人可以让一家公司屈服。<br><br>当然，我所描述的是一个失落的世界，只能通过历史书或老人的记忆来瞥见。这是一个已经处于死亡之中的世界，尽管我正在向其中注入新鲜的二年级生命。 19<strong>世纪末</strong>和 20 世纪初钢铁工人、纺织工人、铁路工人、煤矿工人的大规模罢工已经成为过去。 1954 年，美国劳动力中工会成员的比例达到顶峰，达到 35%。到 1965 年葡萄罢工时，这一比例已降至 28%。十五年后，美国演员工会前主席罗纳德·里根下令罢工的空中交通管制员重返工作岗位，将集体谈判扔进了历史的垃圾箱，而当他们不回去时，他就解雇了他们。如今，只有 10% 的工人享有工会保护。<br><br>工会因多种原因而动摇。职业安全与健康管理法律和各种法规强制公司遵守工作场所安全标准，否则将面临严厉处罚，大多数州都通过了最低（维持生计）工资。美国人是蹩脚的社会主义者，永远本着卡车广告中经常听到的粗犷个人主义精神，奔赴这片土地。许多最大的美国公司，例如亚马逊，已经成为世界级的工会破坏者。正如塞萨尔·查韦斯本人一再指出的那样，大规模移民使得维持联邦几乎不可能。绝望的人们不会长途跋涉来到这个国家进行罢工。他们这样做是为了尽快向贫困家庭汇款。<br><br>但这个国家工会会员人数如此之低的真正原因是全球化。这个词对美国人来说意味着企业找到了破坏工会的最终手段：他们把工作岗位送走了。工会商店里的好工作通常报酬丰厚，而且从前可以让父母一方养家糊口——他们把这些工作送到中国、印度、墨西哥和孟加拉国，在这些地方，人们的工资要少得​​多，“要求”也少得多。<br><br>所有这一切意味着我们有两代或更多代美国人不知道劳工政治如何运作，并且相信#抵制与真正的抵制一样有效。<br><br> 2018 年，两名黑人男子因涉嫌“非法侵入”在费城星巴克被捕，这引发了多年来<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/us/starbucks-philadelphia-black-men-arrest.html">#抵制星巴克</a>的众多尝试之一。这可能是这些努力中最成功的一次，因为它促使公司<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/05/20/starbucks-you-dont-have-to-buy-coffee-to-sit-in-our-cafes-or-use-our-restrooms/">放宽了关于无需购买任何东西即可使用咖啡馆及其浴室的政策</a>。但抵制者并没有真正的权力，因为没有人停止购买星巴克，这显然只是一座太过遥远的桥梁。 #抵制这个地方，是的。沿着街区走到 Peet’s？快点。星巴克最终通过一种自我抵制的方式帮助抵制者摆脱困境，关闭了数千家门店进行一个下午的反偏见培训，从而为这一事业贡献了几个小时的销售损失。<br><br> #BoycottChickFilA 是为了回应业主反对同性婚姻而发起的，始于十多年前，在此期间，该公司不断发展壮大。有原则，有辣鸡三明治，其中之一必须付出。现在有福来鸡#boycotters的反叛乱（它与“DEI=坏”有关），所以保守派和自由派可以找到共同点，一边塞满炸鸡，一边#抵制制造炸鸡的公司。<br><br> #BoycottGillette 和 #BoycottNike 也是如此。这些#抵制活动与劳资纠纷无关。它们是关于广告和美国公司处于“觉醒”领导层口袋里的看法。他们是弱小而无能为力的。这是数百万年轻人参与的唯一一种抵制活动。<br><br>这就是为什么今年春天<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/bud-light-boycott-consumer-effect/674446/">抵制百威淡啤和塔吉特的大</a>获成功让如此多的左派感到困惑、愤怒和伤害。右翼活动人士出于无聊的原因而采用了旧的工会策略，而且它奏效了。百威淡啤损失了四分之一的销售额。 Target 市值损失超过 130 亿美元。我们所有人都将抵制与上个世纪最伟大的一些斗争联系在一起——蒙哥马利公交车抵制，或 UFW 抵制和罢工。但抵制并没有固有的道德地位。这只是一个策略。<br><br>最近两次抵制的种子是相似的，最终都与跨性别者在主流文化中的知名度不断提高有关。百威淡啤聘请跨性别影响者 Dylan Mulvaney 制作了一段 50 秒的宣传视频，仅在她的 Instagram 帐户上发布。塔吉特每年展示的骄傲商品包括一种可以伪装阴茎的女式泳衣。展出的还有童装，这给许多保守派敲响了警钟。<br><br>从更大的意义上来说，抵制活动本身并没有任何意义。一些男人开始喝不同品牌的啤酒。所以呢？一些塔吉特购物者开始去沃尔玛。所以呢？你可以买你想要的东西，也不能买你想要的东西。正如<em>《广告狂人》</em>的每一集所证明的那样，人们与他们喜欢的品牌有着深刻而强大的联系，这种联系更多地与广告有关，而不是与产品的相对优点有关。忘记唐·德雷珀吧；听听米克·贾格尔的说法：<br><br><p><em>他不可能是一个男人</em></p><p><em>因为他不抽烟</em></p><p><em>和我一样的烟。</em></p>这是一个大国，人们有各种各样的想法和感受。<br><br>有意义的是伴随抵制而来的暴力威胁。 5 月 24 日，Target 宣布将移除部分 Pride 商品，因为“这些威胁会影响我们团队成员在工作时的安全感和幸福感”。这是一份措辞谨慎的声明，一些人不禁怀疑塔吉特是否只是在狡猾地安抚抵制者。<br><br>然后，在六月中旬，由于当地媒体收到炸弹威胁，其中许多媒体联系了警方，塔吉特五个州的商店不得不疏散。乍一看，这似乎是该连锁店对极右翼的黑暗暗示的实现。事实要复杂得多。佛蒙特州警察局长表示，这些威胁包括指控 Target <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2023/06/12/target-bomb-threat-pride/">背叛 LGBTQ 群体</a>的电子邮件。在路易斯安那州， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.klfy.com/local/lafayette-parish/lafayette-police-responding-to-a-bomb-threat-at-target-on-ambassador/">当地一家新闻电视台报道了</a>其收到的电子邮件，称该公司是“屈从于极右极端分子意愿的可悲的懦夫”。<br><br>从自由派媒体的反应中<span class="smallcaps">你可以看出</span>这一切对左派来说是多么令人困惑。 《<em>华盛顿邮报》的</em>一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/05/27/anti-trans-boycotts-target-bud-light/">评论</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/05/27/anti-trans-boycotts-target-bud-light/">文章</a>透露，作者愿意参加战斗，但对参与条款深感困惑：“自由市场正在告诉右翼分子他们拒绝听到的事情：跨性别者存在，他们买东西。”但塔吉特市值的巨大损失并不是变性人抵制的结果。这是反变性人抵制的结果。自由市场的<em>字面定义</em>是消费者能够在任何他们想要的地方购物。作者站在历史的正确一边，但站在<em>《国富论》</em>的错误一边。<br><br>还有一种反事实的尝试，认为塔吉特股票的急剧下跌与抵制无关。<em>美国有线电视新闻网商业频道</em>发表了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/02/business/target-stock-fact-check-lgbt-backlash/index.html">一篇题为《塔吉特股价下跌的真正原因》的文章</a>，其中列举了多种因素来解释这一突然的发展，“包括美国经济的更广泛变化、经济衰退的可能性以及塔吉特对非必需品的过度投资。” （“嘿，Smitty，帮我做空塔吉特。我认为周三，购物者会对美国经济更广泛的变化感到恐慌。”）<br><br> <em>《新共和》</em>发表了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/173073/right-wing-war-bug-light-target">一篇题为《右派对品牌的战争愚蠢而可怕》的文章</a>，该文章具有这种形式的特征：作者对跨性别恐惧症反应的愤怒迫使他将抵制活动描述为对手无寸铁的美国企业的无情攻击。 “如果你惹恼了这些小便，你的股价就会暴跌，你的季度收益就会崩溃，你的高管就会被解雇。”自里根政府以来，我还没有遇到过像他这样的言论。如果末日的迹象是<em>《新共和》</em>对安海斯-布希这样的公司的季度收益和高管职位保障感到担忧，那么现在是时候躲进掩体了。<br><br>安海斯-布希 (Anheuser-Busch) 首席执行官的年薪约为 1200 万美元，其仓库工人的起薪为每小时 18 美元，我居住的地方是南加州，那里是全美物价最昂贵的地区之一。临时仓库工人必须能够“在寒冷的温度下在最少的监督下工作”并且“能够满足工作的体能要求”。这些物理要求包括能够在冷藏仓库中花整个班次装卸卡车。福利包包括一些鼓舞人心的语言和“免费啤酒！”的承诺。这些员工不应该每小时赚取 18 美元，而他们的首席执行官坐在符合人体工程学的舒适环境和温度控制的舒适环境中，每小时可赚取 5,700 美元。<br><br>至于Target，该从哪里开始呢？它的商店里充斥着快时尚，众所周知，这是一场人权和环境灾难。其首席执行官的薪酬与员工的薪酬之间的差距同样令人耻辱。<br><br>对这些抵制活动的困惑揭示了一些比对策略如何运作的不明确理解更重要的事情，甚至比它们给跨性别者及其盟友带来的痛苦和恐惧更重要的事情。这是美国人，尤其是美国年轻人中普遍存在的一种现象，以至于人们几乎不再注意到它：一种对他们认为远远超出他们控制范围的巨大力量的无能为力的感觉，包括大公司可疑的或彻底邪恶的行为。<br><br>去年， <em>《国家报》</em>发表了一篇题为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/amazon-monopoly-boycott/">不要抵制亚马逊</a>”的文章：“它们太大了，不能受到个人消费者选择的伤害。相反，要击中他们真正痛的地方。”当我第一次读到它时，我觉得这篇文章很有趣，但几个月后我发现它很令人心酸。作者提出了一个复杂的策略：“当你从亚马逊购买商品时，不要只是感觉不好。通过向亚马逊工会提供两倍的资金来使其发挥作用，并让亚马逊知道原因。”该策略还涉及……购买亚马逊股票。耶稣哭了。<br><br>你可以说，温习微观经济学和逻辑学的基础知识会对这位作家大有裨益。但引起我注意的是她对机器的无力感的个人例子。她说她一直避免在亚马逊上购物，但后来她就失败了。她的猫的兽医推荐了某种产品，并向她发送了该产品的亚马逊链接，作者用该链接购买了该产品：“我立即感到愤怒和内疚，因为在病态便利的文化中试图成为一个有良心的人。我觉得自己很愚蠢，因为我认为道德消费主义除了暂时缓解这些情绪之外还能做任何事。”<br><br>这是一个士气低落的人的标志，一个感觉自己根本没有力量的人。<br><br>我们并没有离开这些年轻人太多。他们中的许多人对全球变暖感到非常恐惧，以至于他们认为将孩子带到这个世界上是错误的。放弃宗教也许让他们中的许多人摆脱了毫无根据的主张——但是什么取代了它呢？是什么提供了一个拥有共同信仰、社会拓展、为了某个更大目标而生活的社区？没有什么。只要愿意努力工作，进入中产阶级的可靠途径是什么？它消失了。美国公司把它送走了。<br><br>百威淡啤 (Bud Light) 和塔吉特 (Target) 抵制活动是二十五年来美国消费者最成功的抵制活动。它们使两家大公司遭受了严重的物质损失。这并不是造成更多厌倦或疏远的原因。这是一个灯塔：这是可以做到的。这是应该做的。<br><br>我说过工会会员数量枯竭的原因之一是 OSHA 使工作场所变得更安全。但就在本文即将结束时，一名 16 岁男孩在密西西比州乡村的 Mar-Jac 家禽加工厂工作时被杀。据<em>《纽约时报》</em>报道， <a data-event-element="inline link"

Robert Oppenheimer) 的一生故事，改编自 2005 年荣获普利策奖的巨著传记，历时 25 年研究和撰写。凯·伯德 (Kai Bird) 和马丁·J·舍温 (Martin J. Sherwin) 所著的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/american-prometheus-the-triumph-and-tragedy-of-j-robert-oppenheimer-kai-bird/9780375726262?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《美国普罗米修斯》</em></a>长达 700 多页；乍一看，很难想象一本关于如此复杂的主题的书如何成为一部电影。遗憾的是，宣威在两年前去世了，但伯德却在参观诺兰电影片场时获得了“遇见”奥本海默的奇妙经历。我和他谈论了这次邂逅以及他的书通往好莱坞的道路。<br><br>首先，这是<em>《大西洋月刊</em>》图书版块的四个新故事：<br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/russian-state-tv-putin-propaganda/674755/">加里·施泰因加特连续四天观看俄罗斯电视节目。</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/mozart-in-motion-book-review-music/674726/">莫扎特魅力持久的秘诀</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/august-blue-deborah-levy-novel/674740/">一位小说家痴迷于本来可以过的生活</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/colson-whitehead-crook-manifesto-book-review/674775/">科尔森·怀特海德失去了阴谋。</a></li>电影上映前一天，伯德和我通了电话。为了清晰起见，本次采访经过精简和编辑。<br><br><strong>盖尔·贝克曼：</strong>你感觉怎么样？<br><br> <strong>Kai Bird：</strong>嗯，我的头有点旋转。这很奇怪。这本书18年前出版。当时大家都在哪里？<br><br><strong>贝克曼：</strong>嗯，你确实获得了普利策奖。所以你不能说它被忽略了。<br><br><strong>伯德：</strong>确实如此。我不能抱怨。但是，你知道，它上周登上了平装本畅销书排行榜。当时它从未进入畅销书排行榜。<br><br><strong>贝克曼：</strong>花了很长时间才被采纳和改编。<br><br><strong>伯德：</strong>嗯，这本书被选中了。但是，你知道，很多年过去了，什么也没发生。所以，当我在 2021 年 9 月突然接到电话时，我们非常幸运，我被告知克里斯托弗·诺兰想和我说话。当时我没有意识到，但回顾他所有的其他作品，他确实是这本书的完美导演。他一直对时间、空间、记忆、科学和科幻小说感兴趣。因此，他会被一本关于量子物理学家的书所吸引，这是完全有道理的。<br><br><strong>贝克曼：</strong>所以你觉得向电影的转变非常顺利？<br><br><strong>伯德：</strong>马蒂（宣威）和我对这本书的看法（对于任何潜在的电影也是如此）是，这可能是一个讲述原子弹制造过程的有趣故事，但如果仅此而已，我们就不会花这么多年——25 年——在它上面。这个故事的主线既是奥本海默在洛斯阿拉莫斯取得的成就的胜利，也是九年后发生在他身上的悲剧，当时他从美国最著名的科学家沦为无名小卒，在<em>《纽约时报》</em>的头版上受到羞辱。他对国家的忠诚度受到质疑。这就是这个故事真正有趣的原因。因此，当我第一次与诺兰会面时，他当时并没有与我分享剧本。他说他的工作是保密的，尽管他已经完成了整个草稿。他工作得很快。我告诉他我认为专注于审判很重要。我认为听到我这么说他松了口气，因为几个月后他给我看剧本时，确实有很多关于审判的内容。<br><br><strong>贝克曼：</strong>如果没有成百上千页的优势，你是否认为这本书的某些方面在电影中特别难以传达？<br><br><strong>伯德：</strong>量子物理学。这也是书中的一个斗争，因为它太复杂了。但实际上，诺兰确实试图解释量子或让你感受到它的音乐。他在影片中提出了一个很好的比喻。他让奥本海默在 1920 年代走过一家美术馆，当时他正在研究量子，他正在看毕加索画的立体派画作。他盯着它们，他在毕加索的图像中看到了量子。书中没有具体提到，但是，你知道，奥本海默的母亲是一位画家和艺术收藏家。她买了早期梵高的作品和几幅毕加索的作品，所以这是完全合适的。<br><br><strong>贝克曼：</strong>通过这个过程你学到了一些关于电影制作的知识吗？<br><br><strong>伯德：</strong>昨晚我第四次看了这部电影。每次我看到它时，我都会看到我第一次没有看到的层次。我听到了一些以前错过的对话，因为节奏非常快。我认为，作为一名电影制片人，诺兰确实很有趣，正是因为他不想让你跟着一起。他并不想确保你理解一切。他在整个视觉体验中留下了一些他没有解释的线索。举例来说，如果你知道物理学家理查德·费曼是谁，他就会出现在电影中，但他的身份从未被提及。但有几次，你会看到这个年轻人猛烈地敲打邦戈， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/06/funny-book-recommendations/674459/">那就是费曼</a>。<br><br><strong>贝克曼：</strong>如果你知道，你就知道！<br><br><strong>伯德：</strong>没错。他希望人们带着疑问离开剧院：<em>哦，那是谁？</em>还有关于麦卡锡主义、与炸弹共存的问题，以及为什么这种事会发生在奥本海默身上？这是正义还是不正义？他不会给你答案。他在决定实际使用炸弹这一非常重要的问题上做到了这一点，这仍然是有争议的历史。<br><br><strong>贝克曼：</strong>我知道他们拍摄时你去了片场。我很好奇你能否告诉我更多关于那次经历的信息，以及它的离奇之处。而且，你知道，会见扮演奥本海默的希里安·墨菲。<br><br><strong>伯德：</strong>这很奇怪。当我遇到希里安时，他在拍完一场戏后被介绍给我，我大声喊道：“希里安博士。”奥本海默，奥本海默博士。很高兴见到你。这些年来我一直在等待。”然后我们进行了五分钟的谈话。我告诉他，我认为他很好地捕捉到了奥比的声音，这很有趣。奥本海默的声音总是很轻柔。这种声音让你想要向前倾身以确保你听清了每一个字。而且每个字的发音都非常仔细。他讲了整段话。希里安的回答是<em>哦，好吧，我很高兴你这么想——但是，你知道，我们尽量不模仿这个声音；我们会尽量避免模仿这个声音。我们试图简单地捕捉它的精神</em>。<br><br><strong>贝克曼：</strong>嗯，当适应效果良好时，这似乎是对适应的一个非常恰当的描述，就像在这个例子中听起来的那样。<br><br><strong>伯德：</strong>我只是觉得我是一个非常非常幸运的作家。<br><br>读什么<br><br><b><em>雨神</em>，作者：阿图罗·伊斯拉斯</b><br><br><em>《雨神》</em>是奇卡诺先驱作家伊斯拉斯的一部精美的多代小说，讲述了沿着德克萨斯州和墨西哥边境的天使家族的故事，在那里，严厉而虔诚的乔纳妈妈的后裔在复杂的家庭拥抱中彼此拥抱。伊斯拉斯 1938 年出生于埃尔帕索，1990 年成为第一个在纽约主要出版社出版小说的奇卡诺人，但一年后因艾滋病相关并发症去世，享年 52 岁。 The novel&#39;s matriarch was a young woman in Mexico when her firstborn, a brilliant university student, was gunned down in San Miguel de Allende during the Mexican Revolution. The Angel family is thrust north to the desert. Readers receive an intimate glimpse of this web of children and grandchildren, friends and neighbors.

As with many laments of cultural decline, the charge is most often levied by the old against the young.

Today&#39;s young people, in this telling, have ushered in the tyranny of the tongue-tied. Stupefied by our phones, we shirk face-to-face contact.

Pictures</figcaption></figure> <strong><em>This article contains spoilers for the film</em></strong> <strong>Barbie.</strong><br><br> The Greta Gerwig–directed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/"><em>Barbie</em></a> is like a Barbie superfan&#39;s imagination run wild. There are elaborately choreographed dance numbers for the dolls. The dialogue pokes easygoing, knowing fun at Mattel&#39;s products. Almost every scene—especially those in Barbie Land, the plastic world run by different life-size Barbies and their respective adoring Kens—contains inventive set pieces, cheeky references to campy cinema, and costumes of the pinkest variety.<br><br> A normal grown-up human would probably seem out of place in such a sun-soaked, glitter-drenched fantasyland, but Gloria (played by America Ferrera) is no mere tourist: She&#39;s a woman who, as a little girl, spent hours and hours playing with Barbie (Margot Robbie). Now, as an adult, Gloria has been trying and failing to connect with her teenage daughter. In her sadness, she revisits her comfort toy, and accidentally imbues the doll with her darkest thoughts, causing Barbie to “malfunction”—her arched feet go flat, and she starts thinking about death. When Gloria meets Barbie in the flesh through a series of magical events, she becomes Barbie&#39;s guide to understanding her capacity beyond being a plaything—as well as the surprising key to understanding the film, pulling its many ideas into focus through a showstopper of a monologue.<br><br> Gloria&#39;s speech arrives at a moment when her role and Barbie&#39;s have reversed. In the real world, Barbie (who&#39;s known as “Stereotypical Barbie,” to distinguish her from the other variants) has discovered that women don&#39;t actually run everything in existence. Her angst deepens when she returns to Barbie Land, where the Kens, after learning how human men behave, have installed their idea of a patriarchy—Kens running the government! Barbies bringing them beers! Horse paraphernalia everywhere!—leaving Barbie with no purpose but to be an ornament to her Ken (Ryan Gosling, a hoot) in her own supposed paradise. Responding to Barbie&#39;s existential crisis, Gloria gives her a pep talk that turns, line by line, into a sharp and sympathetic dissection of the impossible expectations that come with being a woman.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/">Read: What&#39;s the matter with Barbie?</a><br><br> “Somehow we&#39;re always just doing it wrong,” she begins, before launching into a litany of examples. Women are expected to be thin but not too thin; to strive for leadership roles but not be too aggressive; to love being mothers but not make motherhood their only job; to acknowledge that gender inequality exists but not complain about it. “You have to never get old, never be rude, never show off, never be selfish, never fall down, never fail, never show fear, never get out of line,” Gloria explains. “It&#39;s too hard; it&#39;s too contradictory … I&#39;m just so tired of watching myself and every single other woman tie herself into knots so people will like us. If all of that is also true for a doll just representing a woman, then I don&#39;t even know.”<br><br> It&#39;s a quintessentially Gerwig-ian monologue, following the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D8nRpJsQlk&amp;ab_channel=Movieclips">frank analysis of marriage</a> in the writer-director&#39;s adaptation of <em>Little Women</em> , the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVzFS1M_-rM&amp;ab_channel=Methition">nervous reconsideration of a parent-child relationship</a> in <em>Lady Bird</em> , and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94rtEPIifpc&amp;ab_channel=MrNautica">heartfelt evaluation of best friendship</a> in <em>Frances Ha</em> (which she co-wrote with her partner, Noah Baumbach, who also co-wrote <em>Barbie</em> ). Like those speeches, Gloria&#39;s is a little rambling, a little self-conscious, a little indignant—and completely earnest, performed by Ferrera with just the right amount of exasperation. Much of what Gloria says might be obvious to adult women watching the film, but her unvarnished, matter-of-fact delivery is refreshing for its rawness. That the monologue ends on a resigned and rather unsatisfying note only makes it more powerful. The scene builds with each sentence, and Gloria seems poised to outline a solution worthy of a TED Talk—but none exists.<br><br> After all, there isn&#39;t a tidy solution to making the lives of women agony-free, in either the real world or Barbie Land. The monologue lands so well because it helps show that not even the candy-coated expanse works as an ideal: The pressures Gloria talks about affect every Dreamhouse occupant, often in more superficial ways. The Barbies are horrified, for instance, at the sight of Stereotypical Barbie&#39;s flat feet; when one of them fails to meet society&#39;s subjective beauty standards, the rest are as quick to judge as real humans are. And as the film unfolds, it wisely takes time to observe that Barbie Land is not a bastion of equality, at least not when Kens live as powerless citizens whose only role is to be noticed by Barbies.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/tiny-shoulders-review-hulu/559277/">Read: Can Barbie really have it all?</a><br><br> Gloria&#39;s somber monologue is a risky beat for a film as absurd and flamboyant as <em>Barbie</em> , but it&#39;s a crucial reminder of why the movie exists at all—and why it may endure beyond the <em>Barbenheimer</em> memes and its almost overwhelming marketing campaign. The film grasps that Barbie—the toy, the icon—has been the subject of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/tiny-shoulders-review-hulu/559277/">seemingly endless debates</a> since her 1959 debut because, as Gloria makes clear, being a woman means being the subject of seemingly endless debates about beauty standards and gender roles. In recent years, the doll line has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2016/01/barbies-hips-dont-lie/432741/">added a variety of skin tones and body types</a> to modernize the brand, but the image of Barbie&#39;s arched feet endures for a reason: Barbie must always be on her toes, walking a fine, impossible line in order to model womanhood to girls.<br><br> That idea—of products being reflections of our self-image, which is in turn affected by the products we purchase, creating a never-ending cycle—is heady, and one that will probably fly over the children seeing the film. At my screening, a little girl a few seats from me asked her mom over and over to explain what Gloria was talking about. “ <em>Whaaat?</em> ” she whispered during the monologue, before repeating the question at the end of the speech, sounding even more baffled than before. Her confusion made me laugh—and then gutted me, just a bit. <em>Someday</em> , I thought, <em>she&#39;ll get it</em> . And maybe if she&#39;s lucky, she&#39;ll have someone beside her—a Barbie, a Gloria—who lets her know she&#39;s not alone.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 13:39:24 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Colson Whitehead Loses the Plot]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> <em>Crook Manifesto</em> is both powered and limited by its most absorbing characteristic: the author&#39;s voice. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ZaQAoIW56Nz2130Aaz5Utqa69cU=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/genre_fiction_2/original.jpg" alt="yellow maze over photos of NYC" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic. Sources: Allan Tannenbaum / Getty; Anthony Barboza / Getty; Bettmann / Getty; Donaldson Collection / Getty; Walter Leporati / Getty.</figcaption></figure> For the past three years, I have taught creative-writing courses at Georgetown University, and in that time, I have come to accept something I initially found strange: The majority of my students prefer reading and writing genre fiction—sci-fi, mystery, romance—to literary fiction. (A loose explanation of the difference: Literary fiction generally resembles real life and focuses on characters, whereas genre fiction tends to rely on familiar themes and prioritizes plot.) I&#39;d initially constructed a syllabus that was stocked with a variety of classic and contemporary literary short stories, but I soon learned that my students were keen to produce work that resembled what they were consuming outside of class: fantasy epics, apocalyptic science-fiction tales, fearless and risqué romances.<br><br> I am by no means immune to the charms of sci-fi and fantasy, though I&#39;ve long preferred to read literary fiction because of its general commitment to exploring why humans act and think the way we do. But my students spoke passionately about why they found their favorite stories so appealing: They asserted that these works provided a sturdy vessel for their supercharged feelings, emotions that ranged far beyond the realist confines of the work I&#39;d been assigning. They also argued that genre fiction was better equipped to capture the heightened unreality of the current moment, with its abundance of news and information, which can often feel like daily plot twists.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/09/romance-novels-women-elinor-glyn-books/670609/">Read: Don&#39;t call them trash</a><br><br> I began to search for a bridge, an artist who was adept at incorporating genre elements into their writing while maintaining the quality of craft required of superb literary works. I promptly thought of Colson Whitehead. Since the beginning of his career, Whitehead has brilliantly achieved this merger of modes, beginning with his potent debut, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-intuitionist-colson-whitehead/9780385493000?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Intuitionist</em></a> . But working in these two registers simultaneously is not without its pitfalls, a lesson my students could learn from Whitehead as well. His latest novel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/crook-manifesto-colson-whitehead/9780385545150?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Crook Manifesto</em></a> , displays his singular ability to write adroitly in multiple styles, his facility with language, and his customarily sharp and expansive sentences. Yet this novel does not accomplish what he has managed in his previous works. Its characters don&#39;t feel fully fleshed out, and its plot doesn&#39;t capture the extreme feelings and circumstances that readers might expect from what is essentially a crime novel. Because these elements don&#39;t quite gel, this book is both powered and limited by its most absorbing characteristic: Whitehead&#39;s voice.<br><br> Genre novels function a bit like popular culinary dishes: There are generally two paths to success. The first is to follow the recipe precisely and with finesse, so that when someone tastes a bite of your carrot cake, there is no doubt you have delivered a sterling version of a cherished delicacy. The second path is to depart from the recipe and reinvent the dish in a manner that simultaneously references and elevates it. Whitehead has found success with this second approach throughout his career. In his first Pulitzer winner, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-underground-railroad-colson-whitehead/9780345804327?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Underground Railroad</em></a> , for instance, he transformed the titular network of Good Samaritans who sheltered runaway slaves into a network of actual train stations. Ingeniously combining genre and literary ingredients—here, a propulsive, picaresque plot that was also populated with achingly real characters—he challenged and unsettled a history many readers thought they knew.<br><br> <em>Crook Manifesto</em> is a sequel to Whitehead&#39;s previous novel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/harlem-shuffle-colson-whitehead/9780525567271?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Harlem Shuffle</em></a> , a crime story about a man named Ray Carney, who earns a living acquiring stolen goods and selling them for profit. <em>Crook Manifesto</em> also revolves around Carney, but in this novel, we&#39;ve advanced several years, and he&#39;s recently retired from illicit activities to focus on running his thriving furniture store in Harlem. The backdrop is a decaying 1970s New York City where, as Whitehead puts it, “you knew the city was going to hell if the Upper East Side was starting to look like crap, too.” Carney&#39;s teenage daughter, May, is eager to attend the Jackson 5&#39;s upcoming concert at Madison Square Garden. Unable to acquire tickets through conventional means, Carney decides to participate in one last illegal scheme to obtain them. Things go haywire, and he soon finds himself involved in a harrowing crime spree.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/10/colson-whitehead-harlem-shuffle/619821/">Read: What is crime in a country built on it?</a><br><br> The trouble with the novel starts in the second section, which takes place a couple of years later and mostly concerns the attempts of a character named Zippo to film a blaxploitation picture in Harlem (Carney&#39;s store serves as a set for one of the scenes). Carney is now a minor figure, and the narrative threads that Whitehead established in the prior section are mostly abandoned; as a result, <em>Crook Manifesto</em> begins to read less like a novel and more like an anthology of glancingly related anecdotes. This development draws more attention to the third-person narrator, who assumes an outsize presence. The story, such as it is, recedes; the narrator becomes the only meaningful link between the various sections of this book. Whitehead&#39;s chatty prose reliably carries the reader along, sometimes advancing the plot and sometimes appearing to be taken with its own fluency, its startling virtuosity. This is a boon for a novel in which determining why we&#39;re taking this journey grows more and more difficult.<br><br> Whitehead continues to write some of the best sentences in the business. They&#39;re erudite yet quotidian, infused with a sophisticated rhythmic sensibility and sparkling with charisma. For example, here he is describing Zippo&#39;s experience as a budding artist in New York:<br><br><p> Like many artists Zippo had been starved of attention in his younger days, and like many artists he channeled a modicum of praise into a contempt-of-audience phase: Invincible! He took to dressing like a Negro Salvador Dalí and penciled in a handlebar mustache. Shambling in velour, he pushed a watermelon in a baby carriage down DeKalb Avenue and harrassed strangers, demanding to know if they “liked his baby chile.” Everybody assumed he was high most of the time. He wasn&#39;t.</p> Sometimes, Whitehead&#39;s sentences will feint in one direction before arriving abruptly at an unexpected destination. A few pages later, once Zippo finds himself in Los Angeles, he writes:<br><br><p> Christmas in LA was a disorienting affair: the Santas wore shorts and the workshop elves were past-prime centerfolds and future Waitress #2s. The city was like an Antonioni film. The first time you see it, it sucks, and then you see it a second time and it&#39;s incredible. It was like that, except the second time it still sucks.</p> These passages are typical of the linguistic delights on offer throughout the book. However, as the novel continues, flickering among different perspectives, the language attracts attention to itself at the expense of plot. Whitehead, and not the various colorful characters in this book, emerges as the star.<br><br> Early on, Whitehead introduces several tropes that seem to hint at a particular kind of story. We have the reformed outlaw who reluctantly reenters the crime world, the devoted-but-ignorant wife, the corrupt police officers who are working on both sides of the law, and so on. But rather than using these elements to build momentum, Whitehead layers literary pyrotechnics over them: his ambitious, involved sentences; the seemingly random shifts in point of view; his frequent insertion of long-winded descriptions whenever his story seems to be gathering steam; and—perhaps most jarringly—a narrative structure that prevents the novel from cohering.<br><br> Although he doesn&#39;t get the recipe right, there are many reasons to read this book. Whitehead writes about New York with verve, and the novel is studded with fascinating social commentary about the lives of African Americans in the city during the disco decade. Yet as I read, I could not stop thinking about my conversations with my students. It occurred to me that they are advancing a simple and revolutionary idea—that genre fiction is a better reflection of real life than literary fiction. I believe both kinds of literature can offer a bracing view of reality; the key, of course, is how well the stories are executed. Sometimes our lives seem to be dictated by plots that carry us along without our permission; other times, we derive comfort and meaning from insights about ourselves and the characters who populate our days. The best fiction highlights at least one—and occasionally both—of these realities. <em>Crook Manifesto</em> , unfortunately, doesn&#39;t satisfy either remit. I learned a great deal from reading it, but it never felt quite real.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 13:29:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/colson-whitehead-crook-manifesto-book-review/674775/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/colson-whitehead-crook-manifesto-book-review/674775/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The GOP’s Lurch Toward Extremism Comes for the Border]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Republican states are maneuvering to seize control from President Joe Biden&#39;s administration over immigration. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/qIpmFZF--KYKuTGiUEYH87x76XM=/0x0:6000x3375/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_1532793971/original.jpg" alt="Texas State Troopers talk with migrants behind razor wire along the Rio Grande River in Eagle Pass, Texas, US, on July 13, 2023." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Jordan Vonderhaar / Bloomberg / Getty</figcaption></figure> A pregnant teenager writhing in pain as she suffered a miscarriage while trapped in the barbed wire that Texas has strung along miles of the state&#39;s southern border.<br><br> A 4-year-old girl collapsing from heat exhaustion after Texas National Guard members pushed her away from the wire as she tried to cross it with her family.<br><br> Texas state troopers receiving orders from their superiors to deny water to migrants in triple-digit heat.

They also show how aggressively Texas and other Republican-controlled states are maneuvering to seize control from President Joe Biden&#39;s administration over immigration policy. To many immigration experts, these moves by Texas, like the harsh measures against undocumented migrants signed into law this spring by Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, push to the edge the legal limits on states&#39; ability to infringe on federal authority over immigration.<br><br> “US immigration law governs the border; Texas law doesn&#39;t govern the border,” David Leopold, a former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, told me. Federal law, he noted, establishes a process for handling undocumented migrants seeking asylum in the United States. “It may not be a process that I like, or you like, or people in Texas like, but it&#39;s a process,” Leopold added. “And that process does not include taking a 4-year-old child and throwing that child into the water … or depriving them of water when the temperatures are above 100 degrees. Those are not our values. Those are not our laws.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/deterrence-immigration-us-border-policy/674457/">Jerusalem Demsas: Why deterrence policies create border chaos</a><br><br> Abbott has defended the state&#39;s enforcement effort by arguing that Biden&#39;s immigration policies have exposed his state&#39;s residents to dangerous migrants and drug smuggling, and has endangered migrants themselves by encouraging them to make the arduous trek to the southern border. Responding to Wingate&#39;s email, Abbott&#39;s top law-enforcement officials <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/operation-lone-star-statement-on-orders-addressing-illegal-crossings">issued a joint statement</a> in which they maintained that “these tools and strategies—including concertina wire that snags clothing” were necessary to discourage migrants from making “potentially life-threatening and illegal crossings.”<br><br> The red-state offensive against undocumented immigration sits at the crossroads of two powerful trends in the Donald Trump–era Republican Party. One is the growing movement in the red states to roll back a wide range of civil rights and liberties, including voting rights, access to abortion, and LGBTQ protections.<br><br> The other is an arms race among Republican leaders to adopt ever more militant policies against undocumented immigrants. That dynamic is carrying the party beyond even the hard-line approaches that Trump employed in the White House.<br><br> Both DeSantis and Trump, for instance, have promised that if elected, they will move to end birthright citizenship, the guarantee under the Fourteenth Amendment that anyone born in the United States is automatically an American citizen. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/transcript-cnn-town-hall-trump/index.html">In his town-hall appearance on CNN</a> , Trump suggested that he would reinstate his widely condemned policy of separating the children of migrants from their parents at the border to discourage illegal crossings. And <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/immigration/trump-reveals-plan-largest-domestic-deportation--history">he&#39;s promised</a> to “use all necessary state, local, federal, and military resources to carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history.” That&#39;s an idea Trump often discussed but never risked trying to implement as president.<br><br> DeSantis, meanwhile, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://rondesantis.com/mission/stop-the-invasion">has indicated</a> that he would authorize federal border-enforcement personnel to use force against suspected drug smugglers. He&#39;s also talked about deploying the Navy and the Coast Guard if Mexico does not act more aggressively to interdict the arrival of chemicals used to manufacture drugs.<br><br> Simultaneously, DeSantis and Abbott have been at the forefront of the red-state efforts to seize more control over immigration policy. The legislation DeSantis signed contains sweeping measures to crack down on undocumented migrants, including criminal penalties for anyone providing transportation for such a migrant in Florida.<br><br> Abbott, for his part, is building an enforcement apparatus outside the control of the federal agencies legally responsible for managing the border. His efforts represent one of the most tangible—and consequential—manifestations of what <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/04/tennessee-expulsions-republican-gop/673709/">I&#39;ve called</a> the red-state drive to build “a nation within a nation” that operates by its own rules and values.<br><br> Abbott has not gone as far as conservative activists who claim that the Constitution gives states the right to set their own immigration policies, on the grounds that they are facing an “invasion” of undocumented migrants. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2023/07/06/why-ron-desantis-is-talking-about-an-immigrant-invasion/">During a campaign stop in Texas</a> , DeSantis embraced that fringe legal theory and argued that it provides states, not just the federal government, deportation authority.<br><br> Most immigration-law experts are dubious that even the current conservative Supreme Court majority would agree, and Abbott has not claimed this power. Operation Lone Star, the expansive enforcement effort he launched in 2021, is not attempting to deport undocumented migrants it apprehends in the state. Instead, Texas has returned them to the border, arrested them, or bused them to Democratic-controlled jurisdictions. Abbott&#39;s choice not to claim deportation authority under the invasion theory has generated a steady stream of criticism from some immigration hard-liners.<br><br> Yet the revelations in the emails from Wingate, the Texas state trooper, show how far the state has already moved toward usurping federal authority. It has lined its southern border with miles of concertina wire and sunk barrels wrapped in that wire into the river. Recently, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/06/08/rio-grande-buoys-greg-abbott/">the state placed floating buoys in the river</a> to block areas that might be easier and safer to cross. State troopers and National Guard members are also using force to push migrants away from the barbed-wire barricades. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/operation-lone-star-deploys-new-border-security-deterrence-strategies">Republican governors from nearly a dozen other states</a> have sent law-enforcement personnel, equipment, or both to Texas to support Abbott&#39;s efforts.<br><br> “In the federal government&#39;s absence, we, as Governors, must band together to combat President Biden&#39;s ongoing border crisis and ensure the safety and security that all Americans deserve,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/Governors_Letter_Border_Support_1.pdf">Abbott wrote in a letter</a> asking other states to send resources.<br><br> Wingate, in his email, noted one consequence of these efforts: “With the [razor] wire running for several miles along the river in areas where it is easier for people to cross. It forces people to cross in other areas that are deeper and not as safe for people carrying kids and bags.”<br><br> He recounted the story of a woman who was rescued in the river with one of her children, while another one of them drowned. Wingate also reported that a man suffered “a significant laceration” on his leg while extricating his child from one of the wire-wrapped barrels sunken in the river.<br><br> “We have a governor who is literally using the full force of his government to inflict physical harm and even death on people,” Democratic Representative Veronica Escobar of Texas told me. “The fact that he is using the government doesn&#39;t make it any less horrific and it certainly doesn&#39;t make it lawful.”<br><br> Beyond the human costs, the red-state border-enforcement effort raises pointed questions about legal authority. Escobar and six other Democratic US representatives from Texas <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://escobar.house.gov/uploadedfiles/letter_to_attorney_general_garland_and_secretary_blinken_on_rio_grande_floating_barriers.pdf">last week wrote</a> to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, asking them to investigate whether Abbott&#39;s buoys violate US and international law, including the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the Mexican-American War. Escobar told me she believes that not only should the Justice Department take legal steps to stop Abbott&#39;s enforcement program; the Biden administration should be “sending in federal personnel to remove all of” the physical barriers Texas has constructed.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/border-facilities/593239/">Adam Serwer: A crime by any name</a><br><br> The White House this week condemned the actions disclosed in the email; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/07/06/operation-lone-star-doj-investigation-abbott/"><em>The Texas Tribune</em> and ProPublica</a> have reported that the Justice Department is already investigating whether Operation Lone Star is violating federal civil-rights laws. A spokesperson <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/article/justice-department-border-migrants-18208973.php">said</a> Wednesday. that the department is assessing Wingate&#39;s allegations, and it seems likely that the administration may soon announce further actions.<br><br> White House spokesperson Abdullah Hassan told me via email late yesterday that while the White House &quot;won&#39;t be getting ahead&quot; of the Justice Department assessment, it condemns &quot;Governor Abbott&#39;s actions in the strongest terms.” Abbott&#39;s actions, Hassan charged, &quot;are putting the lives of migrants and Border Patrol agents in danger, and are creating chaos at a time when our border enforcement plan has brought unlawful border crossings down to the lowest levels in years.”<br><br> But many immigration advocates have joined Escobar in arguing that Biden should be challenging the red-state encroachments on federal immigration authority more forcefully.<br><br> “There needs to be federal investigations of this,” David Leopold told me. “The Biden administration should be out front in demanding that the creation of chaos at the southern border by these southern governors stops now.”<br><br> Angela Kelley, a former senior adviser to Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, told me that the Biden administration generally sought to minimize conflict with Abbott early on, while it was struggling to redirect many of Trump&#39;s federal immigration policies. But Texas, she said, is now pursuing “actions [that] actually exceed the atrocities of Trump&#39;s child separation policy.” If Biden feels pressure from congressional Democrats and advocacy groups, “I think that they will act, because it will be an embarrassment that this administration sat back and let” Texas pursue such policies “in an arena that is really the federal government&#39;s responsibility,” said Kelley, now the chief policy adviser to the American Immigration Lawyers Association.<br><br> Ironically, Texas is pursuing these severe approaches just as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/30/politics/immigration-border-security-worker-shortages-fault-lines/index.html">administration&#39;s own program</a> finally appears to be reducing the pressure of undocumented migration. Despite predictions of chaos when <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/emergency-covid-pandemic-end-may-11/673954/">Biden ended Trump&#39;s pandemic-era Title 42 policy</a> this spring, conditions appear to be stabilizing somewhat at the border: On Tuesday, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-releases-june-2023-monthly-update">the administration reported</a> that encounters with undocumented migrants at the southwestern border had fallen by more than 40 percent from May to June, to the lowest monthly level recorded since early 2021. But with polls consistently showing that most Americans disapprove of Biden&#39;s handling of immigration and trust Republicans more on the issue, Abbott and his fellow Republican governors clearly have felt comfortable embracing ever more extreme tactics.<br><br> In response to the Wingate revelations, Texas Department of Public Safety officials <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/18/texas-troopers-department-public-safety-migrants-rio-grande-border/">launched an internal investigation and denied</a> that they had implemented a policy of refusing water to apprehended migrants or pushing them into the river. But <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/operation-lone-star-statement-on-orders-addressing-illegal-crossings">in his statement</a> after the disclosures, Abbott made clear that he has no intention of retreating from Operation Lone Star. Conservative Texas state legislators are already calling on Abbott to maintain the effort, and local political observers told me they are dubious that he will back down in any way.<br><br> As long as the Texas program continues in its current form, more abuses may be inevitable. Doris Meissner, the director of the Immigration and Naturalization Service under President Bill Clinton, points out that even if the state has not instituted a blanket policy ordering such belligerent actions as denying water to migrants, “it is highly predictable that this kind of overreach will happen” in individual units because the state is trying to enforce immigration law with people who are “not trained to do this.” Several other Texas public-safety officers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/us/texas-border-migrants-abbott.html?searchResultPosition=2">told <em>The New York Times</em> on Thursday</a> that they had received orders to deny water to migrants and to tell them to return to Mexico.<br><br> Abbott&#39;s willingness to pursue such a militant enforcement campaign, and the decision by so many Republican governors to assist him, provides another measure of the same impulse evident in the proliferating red-state laws restricting or banning abortion, rolling back voting rights, and prohibiting gender-affirming care for transgender minors. All capture a determination <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/12/republican-states-rights-restrictions/621101/">to slip the bonds of national authority</a> and impose a set of rules and policies that reflect the priorities and grievances of the primarily older, white, nonurban and Christian coalition that has placed these states&#39; leaders in power.<br><br> That impulse, as Leopold says, is producing a dangerous “balkanization” of the country reminiscent of the years before the Civil War. It has also motivated the leadership of the nation&#39;s second-largest state to conclude that the threat of undocumented immigration is sufficient to justify, both legally and morally, entangling children and pregnant women in coils of razor-sharp wire.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 12:40:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/texass-immigration-policy-biden/674784/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/texass-immigration-policy-biden/674784/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Biden Declares War on the Cult of Efficiency]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> New antitrust guidelines revive the old-fashioned idea that American life is about more than just buying lots of cheap stuff. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/d-umT0DpY4dqPyPAqJQ1W9OkV7E=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/efficiency_final/original.jpg" alt="An illustration showing Joe Biden smiling against an industrial backdrop" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> The Atlantic / Getty</figcaption></figure> T <span class="smallcaps">his week</span> , the Biden administration very quietly published a manifesto for a counterrevolution. It didn&#39;t arrive trumpeted with flaming rhetoric. There was no televised speech or Oval Office photo op—just a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-07/2023-draft-merger-guidelines_0.pdf">draft memo</a> from the Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission laying out the new standards they will use to assess the legality of corporate mergers. This is, to say the least, not the most scintillating piece of reading that will be released this year. But it may turn out to be one of the most consequential.<br><br> The revolution being countered started pretty quietly too. For most of the New Deal and postwar years, the US government took an aggressive stance on mergers. Concentrated economic power was understood to threaten core American values, and even to have helped trigger the Great Depression. The antitrust agencies tended to be suspicious of corporate deals even when the parties involved were nowhere close to dominating the market. This consensus began to wobble in the 1970s; the arrival of the Reagan era flipped it on its head. In 1982, the administration <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/15/business/us-is-easing-68-antitrust-guidelines-on-mergers.html">issued</a> its own merger guidelines making clear that the days of aggressive antitrust enforcement were over.<br><br> This was not huge news at the time. Kids today certainly don&#39;t read about it in history class. And yet the impact of the policy shift, along with court rulings limiting the scope of antitrust law, has been enormous. In the four decades since, the American economy has grown <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/10/americas-monopoly-problem/497549/">dangerously concentrated</a> , dominated by a shrinking number of airlines, banks, tech companies, and pharmaceutical firms (to name just a few examples). Corporate titans have amassed outsize influence over the political process, smothered start-ups, and often treated consumers with shocking indifference. Study any dysfunction in American economic life long enough—runaway <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/health/hospital-mergers-health-care-spending.html">health-care costs</a> , baby-formula <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6177128/baby-formula-congress-monopoly-abbott/">shortages</a> , regional <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/cities-economic-fates-diverge/417372/">inequality</a> —and you&#39;re likely to find corporate concentration among the causes.<br><br> Why did the Reaganites do this? They were in thrall to the idea that the highest, in fact the only, valid goal of economic policy is <i>efficiency</i> —defined narrowly as the maximum output for the lowest prices. And they believed that Big Business was inherently efficient. They were devastatingly successful at entrenching that view. For two generations, their version of efficiency became the driving logic of competition policy (and other areas, including trade), regardless of the party in power. Concern for how monopoly power might affect workers, small-town businesses, or even democracy itself dropped out of the analysis. The Obama administration&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-08192010">2010 guidelines</a> , for example, exempted even more mergers from review and praised corporate deals for their “potential to generate significant efficiencies and thus enhance the merged firm&#39;s ability and incentive to compete.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/biden-domestic-industrial-investment-chips-act/674529/">Joel Dodge: My hometown is getting a $100 billion dose of Bidenomics</a><br><br> One of the most overlooked features of the Biden administration has been its willingness to challenge the efficiency fetish. The merger guidelines are its most frontal assault to date. In the view of Biden&#39;s antitrust officials, Washington&#39;s turn toward efficiency—a word that doesn&#39;t appear in any antitrust statute—substituted the preferences of libertarian economics professors for the laws that Congress actually passed. The new guidelines seek to undo that. They don&#39;t reject economic analysis. But their guiding theory is that corporations ought to be prevented from acquiring the kind of power that enables abuses, even if econometric models promise some sort of efficiency gain.<br><br> If the new standards were applied retrospectively, some of the splashiest mergers of recent memory would probably not have been allowed to happen, at least not without a fight. Think Exxon and Mobil, United and Continental, Amazon and Whole Foods, and so on. Smaller deals could have been challenged too, because the new guidelines recognize that a lot of little mergers can add up to monopoly power over time. Facebook might have been denied its purchase of the virtual-reality company Oculus. Google might not have been allowed to roll up the digital-advertising market.<br><br> Perhaps the clearest example of the new approach is the guidelines&#39; insistence that the government scrutinize how mergers might hurt workers, not just consumers. This builds on the Justice Department&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/penguin-random-house-amazon-doj/671973/">successful lawsuit</a> to block Penguin Random House from acquiring Simon &amp; Schuster. In that case, the government argued that the deal would have resulted in smaller advances for authors, because one fewer publishing firm would be competing for their talents. The effect on writers was more important than whatever supposed efficiencies might have flowed from the consolidation of the industry.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n the</span> <span class="smallcaps">age</span> of polarization, each political party has learned to exploit the power of the executive branch to the hilt. Unable to use the closely divided Congress to achieve their goals, administrations rely on the far flimsier power of fiat. In fact, the Reaganites helped pioneer the tactic of revolution by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.promarket.org/2022/04/28/a-richard-posner-and-george-stigler-memo-throttling-back-on-antitrust-a-practical-proposal-for-deregulation/">government memo</a> . They saw their merger guidelines as a way to change the law without any actual legislation. As one concerned observer <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3480166">put it</a> at the time, “Under the guise of regularizing discretion, the antitrust laws are being amended without benefit of congressional action.”<br><br> The flaw in this approach is obvious enough: Any executive action can be reversed by the next administration. But bureaucratic policies also have the potential to stick, if skillfully conceived. They can manage not just to survive legal challenges, but to become enmeshed in the culture of the civil service. In the case of the merger guidelines, there&#39;s the further hope that the populist wing of the Republican Party might embrace the policy out of a shared concern with the power of Big Tech.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/tech-giants-are-dangerous-and-congress-knows-it/614740/">Franklin Foer: The tech giants are dangerous, and Congress knows it</a><br><br> The Biden merger guidelines have been built to sustain future attempts at dislodging them. Despite their radical intentions, they pose as an act of modest interpretation of judicial precedent. Every new policy is presented as the faithful expression of existing law, amply footnoted. The implicit argument is that the discipline of antitrust has been eroded from within, captured and distorted by market fundamentalists from the Chicago school of economics. These guidelines present themselves as merely a reversion to the laws as originally conceived and written.<br><br> Will that gambit work? As the name implies, the guidelines don&#39;t have the force of law. Ultimately, the fate of a merger challenge is usually decided by a federal judge. Just last week, the FTC <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/e94b9d46-ae94-4563-b09c-0032a9e7530d">lost</a> its effort to stop Microsoft from closing its $69 billion deal for the video-game developer Activision. The federal judge who ruled against the agency is a Biden appointee.<br><br> Critics will also argue that the new framework is divorced from economic reality and warn that it will result in higher prices. In fact, efficiency-focused antitrust appears to have failed under its own terms: The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262536776/mergers-merger-control-and-remedies/">leading analysis</a> to date finds that mergers have been more likely to raise consumer prices than lower them. But on some level, to focus on price effects is to miss the point. Efficiency was the coldest metric for evaluating a merger. It reduced Americans into the stylized economic caricature known as the “consumer,” treating cheap goods as our highest and only aspiration.

The program encourages you to banish “thought distortions” such as labeling foods “good” or “bad.” It assures you that slipups don&#39;t mean failure, and nudges you to practice “joyful movement.” For the first week, all Noom asks you to do is “simply believe.”<br><br> And if this psychological approach fails, there&#39;s always Ozempic.<br><br> Noom and the dieting stalwart WeightWatchers have both recently added services that will allow their customers to obtain Ozempic and other blockbuster new GLP-1 obesity drugs, such as Wegovy and Mounjaro. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-25/weight-loss-startup-noom-is-getting-into-the-ozempic-business?sref=BGQFqz7X">This spring</a> , Noom launched Noom Med, which pairs its behavior-change program with prescriptions for various weight-loss drugs, the GLP-1s among them. Noom Med will connect its users with doctors who prescribe the drugs—though it won&#39;t cover their often-gargantuan monthly cost. And WeightWatchers recently acquired <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.joinsequence.com/program/our-program">Sequence</a> , an online provider of the obesity drugs. People who sign up get a free WeightWatchers membership thrown in.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/02/intuitive-eating/583357/">Read: The latest diet trend is not dieting</a><br><br> The move marks the latest reinvention of the diet industry—an acknowledgment that, for some people, joyful movement will never be enough, counting calories is insufficient, and drugs like Ozempic can be a crucial tool in achieving good health.<br><br> It also reflects the diet world&#39;s awkward, enduring reality: Many obese people <i>do</i> want to lose weight, but the desire to be slimmer has become a little gauche. We are supposed to love our body, even as we fight like hell to reshape it. To Adrienne Bitar, a Cornell historian of the diet industry, this turn shows that although the weight-loss world has periodically dabbled in fuzzy concepts like “wellness,” “at the end of the day, most people just really want to lose weight.” Why not let them?<br><br> Americans go on yo-yo diets, but we also have a yo-yo relationship to dieting. For the past century or so, the weight-loss industry has bounced between moralizing, shaming, and tepid body positivity, depending on the sentiment of the times. Early eating reformers, such as the cracker namesake Sylvester Graham, thought that eating better could literally make a person better, more virtuous. Gluttony, Graham and others believed, led to sins like violence and masturbation, as Susan Yager describes in her book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Year-Diet-Americas-Voracious/dp/1605290114"><i>The Hundred Year Diet</i></a> . “Treat your stomach like a well-governed child,” Graham advised.<br><br> During World War I, eating less was considered patriotic, a way of freeing up precious caloric resources for American troops fighting abroad. Later, doctors and psychologists came to the (wrong) conclusion that overweight people were lazy, and society adjudicated heaviness a “disgrace,” in the words of Lulu Hunt Peters, an early diet-book author. Dieting organizations ruthlessly shamed people into losing weight. In the early &#39;50s, one such “support” group held public weigh-ins and forced members who&#39;d gained weight to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://responsejournal.net/issue/2020-12/article/reducing-betty-food-suppression-appetites">stand in a “pig line,”</a> where they would sing a song that included the lyric “We are plump little pigs who ate too much, fat, fat, fat.”<br><br> WeightWatchers began in the 1960s, when a housewife named Jean Nidetch <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/business/jean-nidetch-dies-at-91-co-founder-of-weight-watchers-and-dynamic-speaker.html?searchResultPosition=17">invited six friends</a> to her house to talk about their weight struggles. Nidetch eventually lost 72 pounds, and she established group support as a pillar of her new program. Still, she remained preoccupied with the “weight” part of WeightWatchers, urging members to carry photos of their former, heavier selves. Yager quotes her as saying, “I pray that I&#39;ll never forget where I came from.”<br><br> But in recent years, dieting has gone the way of the Livestrong bracelet. Magazines <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/magazine/weight-watchers-oprah-losing-it-in-the-anti-dieting-age.html?searchResultPosition=10">stopped using</a> phrases such as <i>bikini body</i> on their covers. Lean Cuisine offered a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/goodbye-diet-lean-cuisine-combats-dieting-words-ad-blocking-in-new-campa-1/411803/">browser extension</a> that blocked the word <i>diet</i> from web pages. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna8757597">A Dove commercial</a> reminded everyone that size-10 women use soap. It used to be moral to diet; now it was moral to <i>not</i> diet. “Americans are just simply not dieting anymore,” a Nestle USA executive <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fooddive.com/news/goodbye-diet-lean-cuisine-combats-dieting-words-ad-blocking-in-new-campa-1/411803/">told one news outlet</a> in 2016.<br><br> In 2018, WeightWatchers dropped “weight,” literally, and rebranded itself as WW, with a new focus on “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/weight-watchers-changes-name-as-it-shifts-mission-1537807754">wellness</a> .” The company stopped requiring members to have a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thewrap.com/weight-watchers-sheds-name-oprah/">weight-loss goal</a> , and cut <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.news.com.au/finance/business/other-industries/weight-watchers-set-to-ditch-famous-before-and-after-pictures/news-story/041a3dbe3684b92569191c3201218d88">“before and after” photos</a> from its ads. Its expanded set of goals for subscribers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/9/24/17897114/weight-watchers-ww-wellness-rebranding">included</a> “developing a positive mindset.” At the time, then-CEO <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/weight-watchers-looking-to-expand-beyond-dieting-1519784923">Mindy Grossman said</a> , “The world doesn&#39;t need another diet,” and “Healthy is the new skinny.”<br><br> Even so, WeightWatchers and other diet programs worked by modifying behavior, with the goal, spoken or otherwise, of losing weight. (The company now goes by both names.) Noom has a strong focus on psychology; the app includes many articles about stress triggers, mindless eating, and “behavior chains.” “You are not your thoughts, but the observer of your thoughts,” the app told me at one point. It also, however, encourages users to weigh in every day, log their food, and stick to a daily calorie goal. And even as it de-emphasized “weight,” WeightWatchers still offered <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.weightwatchers.com/nz/wellbeing/evolution-of-ww">workout plans</a> and its “points” system of tracking food&#39;s nutritional value. Meetings were renamed “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/18/dieting-is-out-at-weight-watchers-as-it-renames-itself-ww.html">workshops</a> ,” but they still happened.<br><br> GLP-1s work much better than any of these strategies; they take whatever behavioral modification you&#39;re doing and supercharge it. Being aware of the concept of mindless eating is one thing, but with a GLP-1 you <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/21/well/eat/ozempic-food-noise.html">won&#39;t be as tempted</a> to mindlessly eat. The GLP-1 drug Mounjaro can help people lose <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/06/06/ozempic-weight-loss-ruth-marcus/">22.5 percent</a> of their body weight—approaching the amount someone would lose with bariatric surgery. (And people overwhelmingly prefer the medications to surgery.) With Wegovy, it&#39;s 15 percent—still a life-changing number for the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html">42 percent</a> of Americans who are obese. Compare that with diet and exercise, which generally lead to less than 5 percent weight loss, according to Scott Kahan, the director of the National Center for Weight and Wellness, or 7 percent if you add in a guided program like Noom. Some people&#39;s bodies cling to extra fat; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34453886/">research has shown</a> that when obese people begin an intense exercise program, their resting metabolic rate <i>declines</i> —making it even harder to lose weight. Obese people have often tried everything, and “then these drugs come along … like, go for it, man,” Lara Dugas, an associate professor at Loyola University Chicago and an author of that study, told me. “You take that help.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/ozempic-pills-obesity-drugs-semaglutide/674541/">Read: Goodbye, Ozempic</a><br><br> The advent of these drugs raises the question of whether there&#39;s any point for obese people to frantically diet and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/exercise-body-positivity-jonah-hill-stutz-ozempic/673524/">exercise</a> with no end in sight. “The behavioral approach to weight loss has been under pressure for a few years now,” says Alex Fuhrman, an analyst at Craig-Hallum Capital Group who covers WeightWatchers. These companies, seeing the upsurge of Ozempic, want “a horse in the race themselves.”<br><br> Both WeightWatchers and Noom seem to be acknowledging that diet and exercise alone—the mainstays of their programs in the recent past—just don&#39;t work for some people. Executives from the organizations told me they see obesity as a chronic medical condition that sometimes requires ongoing pharmaceutical treatment. “Way back in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, our thinking was people were bad; they ate too much. They don&#39;t exercise, they develop obesity, and then everything else goes haywire,” Noom&#39;s chief medical officer, Linda Anegawa, told me. “We now have learned that, actually, there are certain individuals who, for example, are genetically predisposed to have insulin resistance.” This can lead to abnormal fat storage and a dysregulated appetite—which can be helped with GLP-1s.<br><br> To WeightWatchers CEO Sima Sistani, the drugs might be a solution for obese people who couldn&#39;t lose weight on the program, or who kept regaining it. “There are people who joined this program and lapsed from our program because it didn&#39;t work for them,” Sistani told me. “And we have to be honest about that. And we now know better. So we should do better.”<br><br> To qualify for GLP-1s through either Noom Med or Sequence, a person has to be obese, with a BMI higher than 30, or overweight with a qualifying health condition, such as diabetes. Customers are screened by doctors to ensure that they meet the criteria. Sequence costs $99 a month, and Noom Med <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-25/weight-loss-startup-noom-is-getting-into-the-ozempic-business?sref=BGQFqz7X">costs about $120</a> , but neither rate includes the cost of the drugs, which can top $1,000 a month without insurance.<br><br> To my surprise, weight-loss doctors told me that this merging of diet apps and injectable pharmaceuticals could be a good thing. Kahan cautions that the drugs don&#39;t work well for many people. But services like Noom Med may help obese people who live in remote areas or can&#39;t reach a specialist. “We&#39;ve increased the ranks of obesity-medicine doctors, but still, the majority of Americans don&#39;t have access to one,” he said. “Done well, these virtual-care programs could potentially be extremely valuable.”<br><br> Though medications like Ozempic and Wegovy help people feel fuller and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/21/well/eat/ozempic-food-noise.html">think about food less</a> , the person taking them does have to consume fewer calories in order to lose weight. And that&#39;s where a program such as Noom or WeightWatchers can be helpful. Something like the Noom app, which includes quizzes about which foods are healthiest (grapes or raisins? It&#39;s grapes), may allow people on GLP-1s to maintain a lower weight in perpetuity. What leads to the most dramatic weight loss is a combination of obesity drugs <i>and</i> healthier habits. And dramatic weight loss is, after all, a goal for many people.<br><br> At one point, Sistani used the phrase <i>weight health</i> , and I asked her whether “Healthy is the new skinny” was still the company&#39;s ethos. “I think the word <i>diet</i> and <i>diet culture</i> and where it went wrong was a preoccupation with thinness,” Sistani said. She appreciates the concept of body positivity, she told me. But she also seemed clear-eyed about obesity&#39;s downsides: that it shortens <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://irp.nih.gov/blog/post/2020/01/extreme-obesity-shaves-years-off-life-expectancy">a person&#39;s life span</a> , for example, and increases the risk of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9857053/#:~:text=Obesity%20is%20a%20risk%20factor,risk%20of%20cancer%2Dspecific%20mortality.">cancer</a> and other maladies. “Within that framework is still the opportunity to talk about well-being, and <i>How do I live? How do I achieve longevity? How do I have a strong, healthy life?</i> Your weight is going to be a part of that.”<br><br> The yo-yo has snapped back, and we&#39;ve conceded that dieting people don&#39;t want to be moral, patriotic, or shamed. They just want to lose weight. That desire has always been value-neutral. But now it&#39;s more attainable.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ozempic-noom-diet-industry/674774/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ozempic-noom-diet-industry/674774/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Real Mystery of Bud Light]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> How did it become so popular in the first place? <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Uol9tLbi--WcTD-AgUjNDvHNcJ8=/1x0:974x547/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/BudLight_2/original.gif" alt="An animation of Bud Light cans falling" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Paul Spella / The Atlantic.资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">, Monday through Friday.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small><br><br> N <span class="smallcaps">o beverage</span> stays fizzy forever. Bud Light has been America&#39;s best-selling beer since 2001, but its run at the top finally seems to be ending. The troubles started in April, when the brand unveiled a sponsorship deal with the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, sparking a massive anti-trans backlash. Kid Rock <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/culture/pride/kid-rock-shoots-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney-campaign-1235298048/">filmed himself</a> blasting cases of Bud Light with a rifle. A boycott swiftly spread. By June, the Mexican lager Modelo Especial had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/modelo-tops-bud-light-top-selling-beer-us-may-rcna89350">claimed</a> the top spot in retail sales, according to the market-research firm NielsenIQ. By one measure, at least, Bud Light was officially no longer America&#39;s most popular beer.<br><br> The boycott&#39;s success was stunning. Bud Light had been so popular, for so long, that its sudden decline seemed unthinkable. The truth, however, is that its dominance was never as secure as it appeared, and the boycott merely accelerated an existing trend. America no longer shares a united taste for beer. There are more than 9,500 craft breweries in the country turning out flavorful IPAs and fruited sour ales—the antithesis of light lager—and beer faces ever-stiffer competition from cocktails, wine, spirits, and seltzers. Grabbing a light lager is hardly today&#39;s drinking default. Even when it is, no law of nature requires Americans to prefer Bud Light over similarly bland competitors.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/bud-light-boycott-consumer-effect/674446/">James Surowiecki: The bitter truth about the Bud Light boycott</a><br><br> “We have the most diverse collection of drinkers in the country&#39;s history, who get to choose from the most diverse collection of beverage alcohol brands that have ever existed,” says Bryan Roth, the editor of the alcoholic-beverage newsletter <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.goodbeerhunting.com/sightlines">Sightlines</a> . If Bud Light doesn&#39;t appeal to people, they “can very easily find something that does.”<br><br> H <span class="smallcaps">umans have</span> fermented beer for millennia, but American light beer only dates to the early 1940s, when Coors Brewing Company introduced Coors Light. That brand was quickly discontinued, however, because of World War II grain shortages. The real story of light beer begins in the 1960s, when Brooklyn&#39;s Rheingold Brewery developed a low-calorie, zero-carbohydrate beer using a process invented by the Swiss chemist Hersch Gablinger. They named it Gablinger&#39;s Beer.<br><br> Rheingold released Gablinger&#39;s in 1967, positioning it as a diet drink for calorie-conscious women. It flopped. Joseph L. Owades, Rheingold&#39;s in-house biochemist, then shared the recipe with Chicago&#39;s Meister Bräu, where it became “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4818642458_dc8a10e425_z.jpg">lusty, full strength</a> ” Meister Bräu Lite. After Meister Bräu went bankrupt in 1972, Miller Brewing bought the brand, reformulated it, and reintroduced it as the 96-calorie Miller Lite. It would be the first truly mass-market American light beer.<br><br> Executives at Anheuser-Busch, Budweiser&#39;s parent company, were skeptical. “We think our beer is light enough,” the company&#39;s vice president of brewing said at the time. (In 2008, Anheuser-Busch merged with the Belgian conglomerate InBev to form Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world&#39;s largest brewer.)<i> </i>They were quickly proved wrong. Miller seems to have been the first company to discover that having success with light lager is less about how it&#39;s brewed than about how it&#39;s marketed. Miller Lite went national in 1975 with an advertising onslaught featuring professional athletes selling men on a lager that tasted great and was less filling. The message was: Guys can drink light beer too! It worked. Miller Lite became a hit, shipping 5 million barrels in its first full year. Other companies were forced to respond. Coors brought back Coors Light, and Anheuser-Busch debuted Natural Light and Michelob Light in 1977 and 1978, respectively. But the company was reluctant to release a light version of Budweiser, America&#39;s best-selling beer.<br><br> “They didn&#39;t want to hang their company on it,” says William Knoedelseder, the author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/bitter-brew-pb-william-knoedelseder/9780062009272?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Bitter Brew</i></a> , a history of the Anheuser-Busch dynasty. Chairman August A. Busch III, the great-grandson of the founder, Adolphus Busch, viewed Budweiser as the company&#39;s “crowning glory” and the family&#39;s heritage. “Nothing with the Budweiser name on it had ever failed.”<br><br> By 1981, however, with Miller Lite sales accelerating, the pressure was too great to resist. Busch needed to bet on his lead horse. He commissioned a recipe for what he called Budweiser Light. “He was investing a century&#39;s worth of brand loyalty with this product,” Knoedelseder says. After tinkering with the recipe to lessen bitterness, per the chairman&#39;s standards, the company debuted Budweiser Light in 1982 with commercials featuring a galloping Clydesdale that aired during sporting events. Bud Light, as it was later named, sold well among young and middle-aged professionals, but sales still lagged Miller Lite&#39;s.<br><br> A Super Bowl ad changed everything. In 1987, Anheuser-Busch made a play for younger male drinkers with a 30-second <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T18XOQppkkY">spot</a> during the big game featuring a bull terrier named Spuds MacKenzie—“Bud Light&#39;s original party animal!” Spuds became a pop-culture sensation, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K5BgCI-U7c">skateboarding in sunglasses</a> and drawing the thirsty gaze of scantily clad women. “He&#39;s Spuds MacKenzie,” the narrator of a later ad exclaimed: “One party-loving, happening dude!” (Never mind that the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56228/life-death-and-resurrection-spuds-mackenzie-original-party-animal">dog who played Spuds</a> was female.) Spuds came to embody the fun-loving-frat-boy image that set Bud Light apart from the more staid Budweiser brand.<br><br> The splashy ads helped boost Bud Light&#39;s sales 21 percent in the first full year. By late 1994, Bud Light had passed Miller Lite as America&#39;s best-selling light lager and trailed only Budweiser among all beers, meaning Anheuser-Busch owned the top two spots. Seven years later, in 2001, Bud Light passed Budweiser to become America&#39;s best-selling beer, period: a staple at grocery stores and bars, a ubiquitous option at the ballpark, an entry-level lager to crush at college parties and tailgates.<br><br> But the light-lager market was never a monopoly. If you decide to give up Bud Light, it&#39;s relatively painless to switch to the likes of Coors Light or Miller Lite. Drinkers view such brands as “interchangeable,” says Harry Schuhmacher, the publisher of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://beernet.com/"><i>Beer Business Daily</i></a> : “They&#39;re the same price and they taste the same.” What matters is how customers feel about the brand. Fueled by strong marketing and a loyal Hispanic customer base, the importer Constellation Brands has cultivated a broad following for Modelo Especial. Michelob Ultra, which slightly outsold Bud Light in recent scan data (and which is also owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev), is positioned as a light beer for active, health-conscious drinkers to enjoy after cardio or golfing 18 holes.<br><br> “They&#39;re never getting that volume back,” says Dave Infante, who publishes the drinks newsletter <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fingers.email/about">Fingers</a> . Bud Light sales <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/bud-light-ad-agency-search-ab-inbev-beer-marketing-strategy-and-history/2421881">peaked</a> at 42.4 million barrels in 2008 and had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brewbound.com/news/beer-marketers-insights-50-years-in-beer-volume-flattens-suppliers-grow-brands-shrink/">dropped</a> to 25.7 million barrels by 2020. Even before the boycott, “it was always preordained that it wasn&#39;t going to be the best-selling beer in the country.”<br><br> “I had a really clear job to do when I took over Bud Light, and it was, &#39;This brand is in decline, it&#39;s been in a decline for a really long time, and if we do not attract young drinkers to come and drink this brand, there will be no future for Bud Light,&#39;” Alissa Heinerscheid, vice president of marketing for Bud Light, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ninesliving.com/make-yourself-at-home-podcast-alissa-heinerscheid-bud-light/">told</a> the <i>Make Yourself at Home</i> podcast in March. A month later, Heinerscheid was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/business/anheuser-execs-on-leave/index.html">placed</a> on leave as the company tried to control the fallout of the anti-Mulvaney boycott. Her effort to shed the company&#39;s frat-boy image may have been too tall an order for a brand that built its empire by encouraging young men to imagine themselves as a literal horndog.<br><br> L <span class="smallcaps">et&#39;s not get</span> carried away, though. Just as Bud Light&#39;s seemingly unshakable dominance was exaggerated, so too is the idea that it&#39;s in a death spiral. Agitation over beer is nothing new. “The brewing industry has sustained a number of different consumer movements like this, in part because beer is ubiquitous in American life and easily recognizable,” says Allyson P. Brantley, the author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/brewing-a-boycott-how-a-grassroots-coalition-fought-coors-and-remade-american-consumer-activism-allyson-p-brantley/9781469661032?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Brewing a Boycott</i></a> <i>.</i> In 1966, two Denver-based Hispanic groups launched a boycott against Coors Brewing Company over its treatment of its Mexican American workers; it <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cpr.org/2014/10/03/the-coors-boycott-when-a-beer-can-signaled-your-politics/">lasted until 1987</a> . Jesse Jackson led a 1982 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/07/us/around-the-nation-boycott-of-busch-beers-sought-by-jesse-jackson.html">boycott against Anheuser-Busch</a> to protest its lack of Black-owned distributors. Remember those controversies? Probably not. “Americans tend to not have very good lasting memories of boycotts,” Brantley says.<br><br> Coors responded to the backlash by creating subsidiary brands that hid the corporate connection, such as Killian&#39;s Irish Red and Zima. (After mergers, Coors is now part of Molson Coors Beverage Company, a juggernaut that also owns Miller.) “You have to be a really knowledgeable consumer when you&#39;re standing there in the beer aisle to know where these different products come from,” Brantley says. That dynamic seems guaranteed to blunt the impact of the latest boycott on Anheuser-Busch InBev&#39;s bottom line. In America, the conglomerate <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.anheuser-busch.com/brands">offers</a> more than 100 brands that include not only Michelob Ultra and Busch Light but also the likes of Stella Artois and Hoegaarden, plus once-independent craft breweries such as Goose Island. Representative Dan Crenshaw, the Texas Republican, tried dissing Bud Light by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/dan-crenshaw-bud-light-boycott-17888792.php">displaying</a> a fridge full of beer from Karbach, a Houston brewery owned by … Anheuser-Busch InBev. The bucks go to the same bank account.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/craft-beer-industry/550850/">Read: Craft beer is the strangest, happiest economic story in America</a><br><br> Even Bud Light&#39;s new second-place standing requires more context. Reported figures don&#39;t include draft sales at bars, restaurants, and other venues where you&#39;re more likely to find Bud Light than Modelo Especial. By volume, Bud Light is “still easily the No. 1 beer year to date,” says Roth of Sightlines.<br><br> But tastes change. Schlitz was once America&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://beerconnoisseur.com/articles/schlitz-how-milwaukees-famous-beer-became-infamous">best-selling beer</a> , and the original Budweiser&#39;s run ended in 2001. Bud Light rose to prominence as a good-time brand that brings the party: <i>Our beer is fun! Drink a lot of it!</i> Today&#39;s drinkers tend to have a more sophisticated self-conception. They also have far more options—and opinions. Beer exists in a fractious world in which anything can become ammo in the culture war, be it Disney movies or clothing at Target. No beer brand will ever be so dominant again. It&#39;s difficult to know quite how to feel. Bud Light, engineered to be bland and widely appealing, is hardly a point of national pride. And yet the fracturing of the beverage market represents a certain loss of shared culture. There&#39;s something bittersweet about that. Just a little, though. Not really too bitter at all.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

人居住在树林和山脉中的小镇中。它以斯托和走私者峡谷这两个滑雪胜地以及一条蜿蜒的河流而闻名，当地人和游客可以在这里飞蝇钓鱼和划独木舟。 2020 年， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://projects.propublica.org/climate-migration/">ProPublica 的</a>一项分析认为，拉莫伊尔是整个美国最能免受气候变化综合影响（包括海平面上升、野火、农作物受损和经济影响）影响的县。但那是在洪水之前。<br><br>本月早些时候，县中心附近的莫里斯维尔<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/11/us/vermont-ny-rainfall-totals-floods.html">降雨量为 5 至 10 英寸</a>。附近沃尔科特的道路被毁。拉莫伊尔河的洪水在剑桥周围盘旋，三十人被疏散。农作物全部被毁，主要道路无法通行。佛蒙特州公共安全专员詹妮弗·莫里森称拉莫伊尔县是该州“受灾最严重的地区”。<br><br>七月的洪水只是佛蒙特州今年一系列极端天气事件中最新的一起。在经历了<a data-event-element="inline link"

月 10 日这一周，暴雨淹没了州首府蒙彼利埃，冲毁了全州的房屋和企业。这是自飓风艾琳以来最严重的洪水，艾琳飓风是 12 年前袭击的“100 年”风暴。<br><br>佛蒙特州不再是许多人认为的避风港。如果这个充满田园风光的小州不安全，又远离海洋，而且是该国最凉爽的地区之一，那么很难想象还有哪个地方是安全的。<br><br>学术界长期以来一直对确定“气候避难所”感兴趣，即随着全球气温持续攀升，这些地区不太可能遭受极端高温、海平面上升和内陆洪水的影响，并且可能有能力容纳气候难民。佛蒙特州的城镇经常出现在这些名单上。其中一份由杜兰大学房地产教授杰西·基南去年编制，

年一遇的风暴；未来几十年，阿什维尔预计将容易出现干旱、极端高温和极端降水。如果所谓的避难所的情况看起来如此糟糕，那么我们就急需觉醒了。<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/05/16/nicholas-adams-vermont-faces-a-looming-climate-refugee-crisis/">调查</a>发现，佛蒙特州三分之一的新居民因气候相关原因搬到这里。我的朋友乔·迪克森就是其中之一。他和他的丈夫曾经在德克萨斯州巴斯特罗普县拥有一个农场，该地区每年都会发生更多的野火和山洪。 2017 年，飓风哈维冲毁了一座桥梁，使他们的社区陷入困境。仅一年前，他们搬到了佛蒙特州的秘鲁。乔告诉我，上周洪水过后，他感到一种“深深而焦虑的警惕”——尽管他的房子位于高地，但他还是彻夜不眠地查看天气预报。就像在德克萨斯州的暴风雨期间，他每隔一两个小时就会醒来，出去检查雨量计，看看小溪，等待水溢出的那一刻。<br><br>长期居住在佛蒙特州的人也同样对洪水感到震惊。周六，我在我们当地的有机农场遇到了我的朋友布拉德·皮科克（Brad Peacock），他已经在沙夫茨伯里生活了几十年。 “我不认为我是唯一一个认为佛蒙特州为应对气候变化做好了更好准备的农民，”他告诉我。我们习惯了生活在一个崇尚自然、气候政策先进的北方州。我们预计不会像飓风艾琳期间以及上周那样措手不及。<br><br> <a

在朋友的婚礼上在雨中跳舞，我抱着她还在襁褓中的妹妹。我们不知道很快整个城镇就会因高速公路被冲毁而与世界隔绝。但上周的风暴有所不同。我的两个女儿现在分别是 14 岁和 12 岁，她们的手机收到了洪水警报；他们的朋友发送了水冲过他们房子的视频。最初的降雨过后，我们沿着 7A 号公路向北行驶，调查受损情况。我们的轮胎溅过高速公路上几英寸深的积水。地下室的物品被倾倒到前院进行紧急保管。当地的公园和果岭完全被淹没，巴滕基尔河——通常是清澈的——被径流变成棕色，河水如此之高，在下面咆哮时舔着当地的一座桥梁。<br><br>回到家后，我们的集体情绪都很低落。 “我能感觉到自己在期待一些不好的事情发生，”弗雷泽告诉我。后来，当我们在客厅沙发上观看洪水的新闻片段时，Zephyr 感到忧郁。 “我感到害怕，因为我必须在一个被毁的佛蒙特州长大，”她说。<br><br>与其他美国农村人一样，佛蒙特州人往往与周围的土地有着深厚的联系。我的农民朋友布拉德为田地被洪水淹没的当地人感到悲痛。他在给我的信中写道，有些人“可能永远无法回到他们如此精心照料的土地，这确实伤害了我的心”。 “我知道与土地相连是什么感觉，一想到它眨眼间就被夺走，我就心碎。”<br><br>在全国各地，在气候避风港和已知的风险地区，家庭都害怕失去与家乡的联系。佐治亚州的农民正在<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/6/29/23762219/ai-artificial-intelligence-new-nuclear-weapons-future">写道</a>：“我认识很多从事人工智能政策工作的人，他们一直在阅读罗德的书来获取灵感。” 《<em>纽约时报》</em>对人工智能公司 Anthropic 的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/technology/anthropic-ai-claude-chatbot.html">介绍</a>指出，罗德斯的书“在公司员工中很受欢迎”，其中一些人“将自己与现代的罗伯特·奥本海默进行比较”。<br><br>就像之前的奥本海默一样， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt.html">许多人工智能商人</a>相信他们的创造可能会改变历史进程，因此他们与深刻的道德问题作斗争。即使他们在开发技术的同时，也担心如果<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/ai-threat-warning.html">人工智能变得比人类更聪明</a>并变得失控，会发生什么，随着生成人工智能模型吸收<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/">大量信息</a>并显得越来越有能力，这种推测的可能性已经演变成一种不可动摇的神经症。 40 多年前，罗德斯开始对人类历史上最重要的成就之一进行权威的阐述。今天，它就像一本使用说明书一样被仔细审查。<br><br>罗兹本人并不是一个末日论者，但他了解 20 世纪 40 年代洛斯阿拉莫斯的工作与当今硅谷所发生的事情之间的相似之处。 “奥本海默多次谈到原子弹既是危险又是希望，”罗德告诉我——它可以结束战争，同时威胁到终结人类。他曾 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/richard-rhodes#details">表示</a>，人工智能可能像核能一样具有变革性，并饶有兴趣地关注着硅谷最大的公司为构建和部署人工智能而展开的疯狂竞争。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">阅读：人工智能厄运论是一个诱饵</a><br><br>毫无疑问，人工智能的支持者和建设者会对罗兹在其书 25 周年纪念版的前言中提出的一个论点感到安慰，即核裂变的发现以及原子弹的发现是不可避免的。 “要阻止它，你就必须停止物理学，”他写道。这一论点与乐观的人工智能公司<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/29/us-china-chip-export-restrictions-ai-race">和政府</a>的言论相呼应，他们将这项技术视为全球信息军备竞赛的一部分。按照逻辑，民主国家不能停下来或等待法律出台，以免我们输给中国或其他一些敌对势力。<br><br>这个想法有助于解释为什么技术专家会构建一个人工智能系统，即使他们相信它可以消灭人类的生命—— <em>《原子弹的制造》</em>第一部分中的铭文也是如此。罗德在这里引用了奥本海默的话：“科学中深奥的东西不是因为有用而被发现的，这是一个深刻而必然的真理；而是因为它们有用。”他们被发现是因为有可能找到他们。”<br><br>作为一名技术作家，我职业生涯的大部分时间都在与那些拥有建设冲动的人打交道，无论后果如何。我对人工智能创始人和研究人员的心态感到着迷和困惑，他们说他们对自己正在积极努力创造的事物感到恐惧。我一直在努力使这种性格特征与我自己的倾向相一致：谨慎，对意想不到的后果矩阵的痴迷。我问罗德，这是什么？是什么让人们能够打开潘多拉魔盒？这个问题悬在空中，就在兴登堡号悬空模型的下方，我想象着罗兹在脑海中翻阅着一系列采访和卷角的传记。<br><br>他开始解释。他说，任何伟大的科学家，“在他们 12 岁之前”，都会“有一些形成性的经历，这些经历推动他们走向他们要前进的方向，并让他们决定要经历学习数学或科学的艰苦过程，直到他们能够突破界限。”恩里科·费米（Enrico Fermi）是第一个核反应堆的发明者和原子弹的总设计师，他在青少年时期失去了一位心爱的兄弟，不久之后，他开始痴迷于测量和量化他生活的各个领域。 “他可以告诉你他在街上走了多少步，”罗兹说。 “他看起来非常像一个在数字中找到了他失去兄弟时所失去的那种确定性的人。”罗兹说，十岁时，利奥·西拉德 (Leo Szilard) 因一部关于太阳即将消亡的匈牙利史诗而深感不安，以至于他开始迷恋火箭，以此作为拯救地球的一种方式，这一追求最终使他发现了核链式反应。<br><br> “这么多最终参与炸弹计划的人都是逃离纳粹德国的犹太人，这并非巧合，”他说。 “他们看到了那里发生的事情，他们就在周围，他们知道这很可怕，必须阻止。”罗兹也在自己的作品中看到了童年的阴影，其特点是继母手中的身体虐待和饥饿：“毫不奇怪，我所有的书在某种程度上都是关于人类暴力以及如何处理它的，因为我是这方面的专家。”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">Read: Never give artificial intelligence the nuclear codes</a><br><br>也许这是二元性的另一个教训——在事物的宏伟计划中，我们的噩梦和梦想是一体的。如果说罗德希望人工智能研究人员和创始人从<em>《原子弹的制造》</em>中借鉴一个概念，那就是<em>互补性</em>的概念。这是诺贝尔奖获得者、丹麦物理学家尼尔斯·玻尔的量子物理学思想。据罗兹介绍，玻尔在曼哈顿计划最黑暗的日子里前往洛斯阿拉莫斯向奥本海默传授。用非常基本的术语来说，互补性描述了对象如何具有无法同时观察到的相互冲突的属性。世界包含众多。<br><br>根据罗兹的说法，玻尔从这一观察中发展出了完整的哲学世界观。归根结底，一个可怕的武器可能同时也是一个很棒的工具。 “玻尔的想法给洛斯阿拉莫斯带来了希望，”罗德斯说。 “他告诉关心这种大规模杀伤性武器的物理学家，这个东西将改变战争的现状，从而改变国际政治的整个结构。它要么完全结束战争，要么毁灭世界。前者给了他们希望。”<br><br>在罗兹看来，最重要的教训是，你可能会制造出一种世界末日武器，但事实证明它是不稳定和平的有缺陷的代理人。但反之亦然：旨在让人类永续繁荣的工具可能会带来灾难。因此，对于罗兹来说，对人工智能的真正恐惧只是我们走在一条不确定的道路上，我们进展太快，创建的系统可能违背其预期目的：生产力工具最终会破坏就业机会；合成媒体最终模糊了人造与机器制造、事实与幻觉之间的界限。 “最令人不安的是，社会吸收和适应它的时间太少了，”罗兹在谈到人工智能的崛起时说道。<br><br>在我们离开他的办公室的路上，罗兹停下来给我看了一个胶片盒大小的罐子，里面装着一些看起来像石头的东西。一张褪色的打字标签上写着<span class="smallcaps">Trinitite</span> ，这是 1945 年 7 月 Trinity 核弹试验后从新墨西哥州沙漠地面上刮下的残留物的名称。爆炸温度如此之高，以至于沙子变成了玻璃。 “很诡异，不是吗？”罗德笑着说道。我现在很清楚他为什么把这些文物保存得这么近了。它们是玻尔哲学的物理表现，也是罗德斯大部分作品的主线——与室内设计的互补性。这提醒我们，自然世界和我们为自己建造的世界的欢乐和恐怖在于，很少有东西会按照我们的预期行事。无论我们如何努力，我们都无法同时观察到这一切。它提醒人们，存在于无法解开的谜团中所固有的兴奋和恐惧。<br><br></div>
