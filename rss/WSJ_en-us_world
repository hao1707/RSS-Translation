But it is also leaving hospitals in developing countries and some wealthier nations such as the UK worse off, as they lose staff to countries offering bigger paychecks.</p><p> Australia has been one of the most aggressive poachers, with offers of special bonuses and fast-tracked visas. An Australian advertising campaign in the British Isles this past winter featured workers with sunshine streaming through windows behind them. The campaign coincided with British nurses <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-k-nurses-stage-biggest-ever-strike-as-health-system-strains-11671121289?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">going on strike</a> over pay, long hours and other concerns.</p><p> “You can surf in the early mornings, go fly fishing on weekends, take photography classes, write novels, or sell preserves at the farmers&#39; markets,” stated an ad in the British Medical Journal, an industry magazine, for an emergency-medicine registrar job.</p><div class="media-object scope-web,mobileapps

"></div><p> The health department in Australia&#39;s Tasmania state, which placed the ad, said that like other local authorities it is looking to many countries including the UK for overseas workers.</p><p> The battle is part of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worlds-biggest-economies-cautiously-open-their-doors-to-more-foreign-workers-664c3549?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">a global resurgence in migration</a> that is reshaping the world economy this year. As borders have reopened since the worst of the pandemic, countries have been welcoming foreign workers in selected industries to address labor shortfalls, helping push migration to record levels.</p><p> Douglas Chikobvu, a nurse at Gweru Provincial Hospital in Zimbabwe, said he has watched about a dozen nurses from his surgical ward move to take jobs abroad in recent years.</p><p> Chikobvu, who is secretary-general of the Zimbabwe Professional Nurses Union, said that in some hospitals one nurse sometimes ends up looking after 25 or 30 patients during a shift, instead of a more reasonable level of 10.

These countries on average have just 15 health workers per 10,000 people, compared with 148 per 10,000 in high-income countries.</p><p> The WHO has asked its members not to actively recruit doctors and nurses from these 55 nations without first sealing bilateral agreements to support the countries where they are recruiting. Such support could include financing the training of new staff or plans for health workers to return to their country of origin after a number of years.</p><p> For wealthier countries, luring medical staff from abroad is attractive because it can take years to train nurses and doctors.

        </span></p></div></div><p>Republicans have been probing whether Joe Biden had any involvement in his son&#39;s business dealings, and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) said that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/kevin-mccarthy-says-house-on-course-to-impeach-biden-1ae4dbd4?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Republicans are set to pursue an impeachment inquiry</a> of President Biden to boost their investigatory powers. The White House has said that Biden was never in business with his son.</p><p> Archer appeared Monday in front of a GOP-led panel probing the business dealings of Biden&#39;s son, the latest in a long-running political drama about the younger Biden&#39;s globe-trotting consulting and investment work for Ukraine&#39;s Burisma energy company and a variety of foreign entities in places including China.</p><p> Archer testified that Joe Biden was put on the phone to help Hunter Biden sell what he called “the brand,” according to Rep. James Comer (R., Ky.), who chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Accountability.</p><p> Comer said Archer testified that there were about 20 phone calls including Joe Biden. The calls took place while Joe Biden was vice president and included one during a dinner in Paris with a French energy company and another in China with Jonathan Li, the CEO of Chinese private-equity firm BHR.</p><p> Archer&#39;s testimony “confirms Joe Biden lied to the American people when he said he had no knowledge about his son&#39;s business dealings and was not involved,” said Comer.</p><p> Hunter Biden&#39;s legal team downplayed the importance of the testimony. “It&#39;s well known that Hunter and his father speak daily,” said lawyer Abbe Lowell. “What Mr. Archer confirmed today was that when those calls occurred during Hunter&#39;s business meetings, if there was any interaction between his father and his business associates, it was simply to exchange small talk,” he said.</p><p> The White House has denied that President Biden was a party to his son&#39;s business dealings. White House spokesman Ian Sams said the GOP probe amounted to an “evidence-free wild goose chase” and that the testimony Monday didn&#39;t show any wrongdoing. While running for president, Joe Biden <a href="https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1175486006348460032?s=20" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he had “never spoken to my son about his overseas business dealings.”</p><p> Rep. Dan Goldman (D., NY), also on Oversight, said Republicans had failed to show any involvement by President Biden in his son&#39;s activities. “This investigation is a complete waste of time,” he said.</p><p> Archer&#39;s testimony was “very, very consistent that none of those conversations ever had to do with any business dealings or transactions,” Goldman said.</p><p> Goldman also said that it wasn&#39;t always clear that Joe Biden was aware that he was on speakerphone with Hunter Biden&#39;s associates. “Hunter would put his father on speakerphone with whomever was at dinner and there was no indication that he had any idea who was at dinner,” Goldman said.</p><p> Rep.</p> Andy Biggs (R., Ariz.), another member of Oversight, said Archer testified that only pleasantries were exchanged when Joe Biden was on the phone. Still, Biggs said that he was confident that the testimony implicated Biden in his son&#39;s business activities.<p></p><p> Archer&#39;s testimony covered a period when he and Hunter Biden served on Burisma&#39;s board of directors. Comer said that Archer testified that Burisma&#39;s owner “placed constant pressure on Hunter Biden” to “get help from DC” to tamp down Viktor Shokin, a Ukrainian prosecutor who was investigating Burisma for corruption. Joe Biden had called for the ouster of Shokin because he and others thought that the prosecutor wasn&#39;t aggressive enough.</p><p> Archer didn&#39;t respond to questions on his way out of the hearing Monday afternoon.</p><p> Archer and Hunter Biden were involved in businesses together since at least 2009. The two men served together on the board of Burisma, which has become the focus of a Republican-led investigation into potential conflicts of interest.</p><p> Archer was convicted of securities fraud and conspiracy charges related to a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/judges-revive-conviction-of-hunter-bidens-ex-business-partner-11602179125?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">scheme to defraud a Native American tribal corporation</a> and was sentenced to 12 months in prison. He has appealed the verdict, but is due to report to prison and begin serving his sentence in the coming months. </p><div class="media-object scope-

        </span></p></div></div><p>Neighboring Nigeria and other West African countries are considering using military force to return the president to power. A senior State Department official declined to say whether the US supported an intervention by the African nations, saying it&#39;s a tricky question in part because an attack on Niger&#39;s presidential guard could endanger Bazoum.</p><p> At an emergency summit on Sunday, leaders from the Economic Community of West African States said they would give Niger&#39;s military junta, which is led by Gen. Omar Tchiani, the head of the presidential guards, one week to back down. Failing that, the leaders of the group, known as Ecowas, said they would take more forceful measures, including a possible military intervention, to return Bazoum to power.</p><p> The West African leaders also announced a string of painful financial and trade sanctions, including the suspension of the sale of electricity and fuel to Niger and freezing the country&#39;s reserves at the regional central bank.</p><p> But the bloc&#39;s decision is facing opposition from other military leaders in the region who also came to power through coups and are now siding with Russia. In a joint statement late Monday, Burkina Faso and Mali, which are led respectively by Capt. Ibrahim Traore and Col. Assimi Goïta, said they had agreed to support the Niger junta. They said they would assist the coup plotters in Niamey if they were attacked. “Any military intervention against Niger will be considered as a declaration of war against Burkina Faso and Mali,” their joint statement said.</p><p> On Saturday, the European Union and France said they had suspended financial support for Niger&#39;s government, amounting to several hundred million dollars a year, while US Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that US assistance to the country <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/blinken-says-u-s-aid-to-niger-in-jeopardy-following-coup-766a0156?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">was in jeopardy</a> .</p><p> French officials said Monday that they hoped that the concerted economic and political pressures could persuade the Nigerien Armed Forces to renounce their support for the rebellion led by Niger&#39;s presidential guard and its leader, Tchiani.</p><p> Having a military-led government in Niger poses great risks to powerful West African nations such as Nigeria, which shares a roughly 1,000-mile border with Niger, as well as the US and Europe. All three have worked closely with Bazoum&#39;s government and Niger&#39;s military to fight Islamist militants in the Sahel region, the semiarid strip south of the Sahara. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Now it is facing deals gone bust where $63 million of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/atlantas-record-62-million-crowdfunding-deal-raises-red-flags-with-some-investors-11661266801?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">customer cash</a> has gone missing.</p><p> CrowdStreet raised $4 billion for property developers by touting big returns, but many deals fell short.</p><p> After this story was published Monday, CrowdStreet said it was replacing its chief executive officer.</p><p> The deals that went bust involved a real-estate developer called Nightingale Properties, which raised money to buy office buildings in Atlanta and Miami. In a bankruptcy filing this month, the newly named chief restructuring officer of the projects alleged that the buildings were never purchased and all but $127,000 of the investor money was transferred to other accounts, including some belonging to Nightingale&#39;s chief executive officer. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"><img width="600" height="1000" src="https://images.wsj.net/im-825518?width=600" alt="不明确的" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><p> CrowdStreet promoted the Nightingale offerings despite several potential red flags. The developer omitted results from two bad deals from the track record shown to investors. An arbitration clause in the deals&#39; operating agreements stipulated that disputes would be settled by a rabbinical court.</p><p> A lawyer for Nightingale and its CEO, Elie Schwartz, declined to comment. CrowdStreet Chief Executive Tore Steen, who was replaced, last week declined to answer whether his company bore any responsibility for the missing money, saying, “CrowdStreet did not commit the fraud here.” Steen&#39;s departure was earlier reported by The RealDeal.</p><p> CrowdStreet is one of the largest of several platforms that enable small investors to band together to buy office buildings, hotels and other types of commercial real estate. Developers made pitches to investors in webcasts, while a CrowdStreet representative stepped in to announce when the “Invest Now button” had been activated.</p><p> Developers pay fees to advertise their deals, and investors can buy slivers of equity for as little as $25,000. Sponsors of more than 770 deals have raised more than $4 billion on the platform.<br><br> A Wall Street Journal review of 104 completed deals and other deals that were aborted or still in process found that many failed to meet returns suggested in sales pitches. When developers fell short of funds, they asked investors to pony up more cash or risk losing their investments. CrowdStreet also helped raise cash for a firm that lied about its track record to investors, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Justice Department, and whose chief executive was later sentenced to prison for fraud for the fundraising. </p><div class="media-object scope-

        </span></p></div></div><p>The Journal analyzed data on expected and realized returns of 104 completed deals from the sale of property or investor redemptions, which the company posted from 2013 to August 2022.</p><p> The Journal analysis found that more than half of those investments promoted on CrowdStreet&#39;s platform failed to meet their target returns. Hundreds of CrowdStreet users lost some $34 million on 19 deals that underperformed as of this July, according to the Journal&#39;s analysis. A dozen of those deals lost nearly 100% of investor funds.</p><p> CrowdStreet also hosted successful deals. More than 20 deals outperformed projected return rates by at least 10 percentage points. Hundreds of others are still outstanding. It often takes at least three years before investors can realize a return on their investments.</p><p> A spokeswoman for the platform said the company sees deals that realize returns above estimates as well as below, and has generated $307 million in profits for investors.</p><p> Several developers ran into unexpected costs or underestimated their cash needs because of supply shortages, rising prices or higher interest rates.</p><p> Between 2020 and 2021, Fountain Residential Partners raised $45 million on CrowdStreet for three off-campus student-housing projects at Clemson University, the University of Arkansas and Louisiana State University, including one that needed major overhauls and another that was essentially uninhabitable <strong>&nbsp;</strong> for months after a flood.</p><p> Cost overruns led Fountain to ask CrowdStreet investors for an additional $12.4 million and in September were told to expect a call to raise millions more.</p><p> “It looks like we&#39;re going to need another $20 million to finish the project,” said Fountain CEO Brent Little in a September webinar for the Arkansas project. Little blamed the overruns on materials including <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sky-high-lumber-prices-are-back-11639842879?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">lumber prices</a> that shot up during the pandemic. The company didn&#39;t disclose the need for more funds to complete repairs for months because “we felt it would send panic which wasn&#39;t necessary,” he said.</p><p> Little declined to comment. </p><div class="media-object scope-

In a pitch for a private real-estate investment trust run by the company, it said higher interest rates have historically increased property values. Property values typically fall when rates rise and have declined 15% since the Federal Reserve began raising interest rates last year, according to the Green Street Commercial Property Price Index.</p><p> In 2018, MG Capital Management, which said it was “the largest owner-manager of debt-free individual luxury properties in Manhattan,” pitched a new fund to CrowdStreet investors. CrowdStreet&#39;s chief investment officer said of MG at the time, “We exclusively work with leading sponsors on commercial real estate offerings that meet our strict marketplace requirements.”<br><br> MG Capital&#39;s offering materials said the firm had overseen two funds that returned four times the S&amp;P 500&#39;s performance over 10 years. It said investors in the new fund were “100 percent protected from loss.” MG Capital raised $1.8 million from CrowdStreet investors of the $35 million in total it raised for the fund. The 23 investors in the deal recovered about one-third of their money, according to CrowdStreet.<br><br> In 2021, the SEC and Justice Department charged MG Capital and its manager with securities fraud. MG Capital&#39;s funds had falsified reports to conceal huge losses, and its prior funds never existed, the government said. MG Capital&#39;s chief executive, who pleaded guilty to securities fraud for the fundraising and was sentenced to 60 months in prison, and MG Capital settled with the SEC.</p><p> The Nightingale deal for the Atlanta Financial Center was one of CrowdStreet&#39;s largest ever. Potential investors received an email from CrowdStreet&#39;s chief investment officer with the subject line: “$10B Enterprise Sponsor Brings Trophy Asset with Huge Potential in Hot Market.” Nightingale raised around $54 million from 654 CrowdStreet investors for the shimmering glass-covered office building in Atlanta&#39;s Buckhead neighborhood. The developer also raised around $8 million for a Miami building.</p><p> CrowdStreet assessed Nightingale in its highest tier as an “enterprise” sponsor, indicating it had a national footprint and a portfolio worth more than $5 billion. The listing projected an internal rate of return of 28.1%, among the highest for a project on the platform. </p><div class="media-object scope-

At the time, a spokesman for CrowdStreet said that the omissions were benign and inessential and investors were offered their money back if they wanted it.</p><p> CrowdStreet&#39;s Steen told the Journal in an interview last week that the company had analyzed the undisclosed deals as part of its process but didn&#39;t think that defaults or foreclosures should prevent developers from listing on the platform.</p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"></div><p> CrowdStreet allowed investors to fund the deal through February, but several say they began asking for their money back from both CrowdStreet and Nightingale. Campbell said it took 11 emails and a conference call with Nightingale executives before his funds were returned in June.<br><br> Denys Glushkov began asking for his funds in March. CrowdStreet told him Nightingale was honoring refund requests, but the next day Nightingale told him in an email that it was “not considering any redemptions at the moment,” as it tried to close the deal for the building.</p><p> Glushkov was told in May he was added to a list of coming redemptions but never got his money. The vehicle with investor cash filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware on July 14.<br><br> Later that day, Anna Phillips, who had been named the fiduciary of the vehicle, told investors that financial records showed millions of dollars had been transferred to Schwartz and his affiliates soon after it was raised from investors. There was just $127,000 of investor money left behind.</p><div class="media-object scope-web

"></div><p> TEL AVIV—For months now, hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been taking to the streets against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-protests-judicial-overhaul-netanyahu-7e264a71?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">divisive plans</a> to curb the powers of the country&#39;s Supreme Court. Some call it a struggle for the Jewish state&#39;s soul, casting the battle in almost cosmological terms as they fight to preserve what they say is the only brake against any future authoritarian government.</p><p> The country&#39;s two million Arab citizens—more than a fifth of the population—have largely kept out of it.</p><p> At first glance, their absence is curious. The Supreme Court has been one of the strongest defenders of Arab civil rights. The government&#39;s plan to limit the power of the court and hand more control to elected officials could arguably hurt Israel&#39;s minorities the most, legal experts say, by paving the way for legislation aimed at disenfranchising Arab citizens.</p><p> Israel&#39;s Arabs, though, say that they have long felt alienated from the state and that the debates about the future of the Jewish people don&#39;t have much to do with their day-to-day problems, such as crime and unemployment. Many say they already feel like second-class citizens.</p><p> “Arabs don&#39;t participate because they don&#39;t feel a part of the state, but more like an appendage,” said Abed Kaboub, a 41-year-old lawyer from the mixed Arab-Jewish city of Jaffa.</p><p> Netanyahu&#39;s government says the overhaul is needed <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/israel-netanyahu-government-judicial-overhaul-protests-862dffd3?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">to recalibrate a judicial system</a> that grabbed too much power and leans too far to the left. Protesters often speak of equality for all, including the country&#39;s Arab population. But they also play heavily off Zionist ideals, portraying Israel as the homeland for the Jewish people. Israeli flags are abundant at the protests and the national anthem, “Hatikva,” which speaks of the Jewish soul, is sung.</p><p> Arab citizens say such imagery can be off-putting for Israel&#39;s non-Jewish population. Many argue that the demonstrators&#39; chants of democracy ring hollow since they don&#39;t address Israel&#39;s occupation in the West Bank, where two million Palestinians live under a mix of Israeli military rule and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/young-palestinians-battle-israeli-troops-and-the-palestinian-authority-deepening-unrest-11663761718?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">the faltering Palestinian Authority</a> . </p><div class="media-object scope-

Rallying around the Israeli flag and singing [the national anthem] isn&#39;t something they will get behind,” said Diana Buttu, a Palestinian lawyer who lives in the Jewish-Arab city of Haifa.</p><p> The weekly demonstrations in Tel Aviv and other cities, which have taken place <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/israeli-protesters-pledge-to-intensify-civil-unrest-76b69af9?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">for 30 weeks straight</a> , attract a small crowd of antioccupation protesters who wave Palestinian flags.</p><p> The National Protest Movement, an umbrella group for many of the groups that have demonstrated across the country, said that some Arab Israelis have joined protests in Haifa, but also acknowledged “legitimate concerns that may have deterred others from joining.”</p><p> “By recognizing the unique challenges faced by different communities and valuing diverse perspectives, we strive to build bridges of trust and solidarity,” the group said.</p><p> The lack of participation in the protest movement follows a longstanding policy of some Arab citizens of Israel to boycott the political process, part of an antipathy to the idea of a Jewish state. Historically, Arab citizens have voted at a much lower rate in national elections than Jewish Israelis.</p><p> Other Arab citizens say the protests don&#39;t address their specific concerns, including high levels of poverty and crime in Arab towns.</p><p> For many Arab Israelis like Ahmad Mahamid, 30, a Hebrew teacher from the Arab Israeli city of Umm El-Fahm, the issue of preserving Israel&#39;s liberal democracy is disconnected from the everyday struggles his community faces.</p><p> Arab Israelis are likely to be poorer, have a shorter life expectancy and be less satisfied with their lives than Jewish Israelis, according to Israel&#39;s Central Bureau of Statistics. They have long complained that discrimination in allocating government resources has led to them having poorer schools and a lack of housing and proper infrastructure. </p><div class="media-object scope-

This year, 111 Arab citizens of Israel have been killed in crime-related events, a 135% increase from the same period in 2022, according to the Abraham Initiatives, a nonprofit organization that deals with Arab-Jewish relations.</p><p> “They are busy safeguarding their private little democracy while we are busy trying to survive—avoiding whatever stray bullet might hit us at random,” said Mahamid.</p><p> Israel&#39;s Supreme Court has in the past struck down laws aimed at limiting the rights of Palestinians and Arab citizens. For example, the court in a landmark 2000 case said that Jewish communities built on state land couldn&#39;t ban Arabs from moving in. It also struck down legislation that enforced sanctions on anyone calling to boycott Israel and a law that prevented Palestinians from claiming damages from Israeli security forces in the occupied West Bank.</p><p> Netanyahu&#39;s coalition, made up of right-wing, ultranationalist and religious conservative political parties, has discussed passing legislation that would effectively limit Arab political participation by banning any party that doesn&#39;t recognize Israel as a Jewish state from Parliament, known as the Knesset. Today&#39;s Supreme Court would likely strike down such legislation, and the judicial overhaul could limit the court&#39;s ability to do so.</p><p> Ayman Odeh, head of the left-wing Arab-Jewish Hadash party, has participated in some of the protests and called on Arab citizens to get involved.</p><p> “Arab society must strengthen its participation in the protests,” Odeh tweeted earlier this month. “Despite the legitimate criticism and despite the challenge, we will be the first to be harmed by a further limiting of the democratic space,” he wrote. </p><div class="media-object scope-

        </span></p></div></div><p>Still, groups fighting for equal rights for Arab citizens say they have lost the majority of cases brought before the court. This includes a law to effectively allow small Jewish communities in areas with large Arab populations to ban Arabs from moving in, on the basis of preserving shared communal values. The court upheld another law that severely limits marriage between Arab Israelis and Palestinians in the West Bank. The largest blow came in 2018, when the court sided with the government over a law that defined Israel as a Jewish state.</p><p> Arab Israelis&#39; confidence in the Supreme Court has fallen in recent years, from 75% in 2017 to 42% in 2022, according to polling by the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security.</p><p> But the biggest complaint among many Arab Israelis over this wave of antigovernment protests is the scant attention demonstrators give to the West Bank, where Palestinians have lived under Israeli military occupation since Israel seized the territories from Jordan in 1967.</p><p> “Whatever they are trying to work against won&#39;t change the fact of the Israeli occupation, which they simply ignore,” said Hasan Haj-Yahya, a 29-year-old schoolteacher from the Arab Israeli town of Tayibe. “Why would we waste our days and nights fighting for what will ultimately bolster an image of the country that we know to be false?” </p><div class="media-object scope-
