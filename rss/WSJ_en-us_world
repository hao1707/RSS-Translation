Just not the kind the country needs.</p><p> China&#39;s economy got a fresh dose of bad news on Monday, with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-economy-barely-grows-as-recovery-fades-5652a92a?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">growth in the second quarter of the year slowing to 0.8%</a> when compared with the prior quarter—losing steam just months after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-covid-dropped-restrictions-reopen-xi-11673534796?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">lifting strict Covid-19 measures</a> that had suppressed the economy for the better part of three years.</p><p> The fading recovery has raised expectations that Chinese officials will unveil limited new measures to juice growth soon, including interest rate cuts and more easing in the housing market, in a bid to combat the rising risk of deflation and growing signs of weak confidence among consumers and businesses.</p><p> The country&#39;s gross domestic product grew by 6.3% in the second quarter when compared with a year earlier, up from the 4.5% growth rate in the first quarter. But that healthy-looking figure was aided by a comparison to a period last year when Covid lockdowns were hammering supply chains and bringing almost all economic activity to a halt. It was also far weaker than the 6.9% expected by economists polled by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p> Other troubling signs included <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-problem-that-wont-go-away-in-china-high-youth-unemployment-f22e3b8c?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">youth unemployment</a> rising to a record high in June, while retail sales inched up just 0.2% from May. Beijing&#39;s full-year growth target of around 5%—once viewed as conservative—is now at risk unless authorities respond with more forceful measures, economists say.</p><p> The problem for Chinese policy makers is that injecting more credit into the market and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-banks-cut-rates-to-spur-economic-growth-11661151854?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">cutting interest rates modestly</a> , as they have been doing in recent months, is likely to have little effect, since <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fueled-by-long-credit-binge-chinas-economy-faces-drag-from-debt-purge-e4621859?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">few businesses and families want to borrow</a> to finance investment or spending. Beijing&#39;s traditional playbook for propping up growth—by spending on infrastructure and supporting manufacturers, rather than focusing on households—is also yielding diminishing returns.</p><p> Instead, China should provide more direct support to individual consumers, many economists say.</p><p> There is an expectation that “once you get into a deflationary environment with weak confidence, that will prompt the officials to do more,” said Mary Lovely, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.</p><p> “The question is, &#39;What can they do that is going to be effective?&#39; ” she added. “Everywhere they turn, they&#39;ll find constraints.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

But measures so far have fallen short of what is needed to provide a meaningful boost to the economy,” economists at Capital Economics wrote in a note to clients, while cutting their forecast for full-year growth to 5.5%, from 6% previously.</p><p> The Wall Street Journal reported in June that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-cuts-rates-to-prop-up-flagging-recovery-6fe3ec72?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Beijing was considering issuing roughly one trillion yuan</a> , equivalent to about $140 billion, of bonds to help indebted local governments and boost business confidence. The special bonds would be used to finance infrastructure projects and other initiatives aimed at boosting economic growth, or used to help local governments repay their debt.</p><p> Top officials are due to meet this month and are expected to announce another bundle of measures. Many economists expect them to be limited in scope.</p><p></p> Rory Green, head of Asia and China research at TS Lombard in London, said he expects officials to take steps to ease funding strains at local governments to free up financing for infrastructure investment. Steps could include issuing more bonds or prodding banks to extend new loans.<p></p><p> He said he also expects the government to announce small measures to lift consumption, such as handing out vouchers that need to be spent. But Green doesn&#39;t think such meager support will be sufficient for most consumers.</p><p> More economists, and even some former officials, have begun calling for Beijing to adopt a new approach to stimulate growth—one aimed at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/deflation-looms-in-china-as-rebound-continues-to-lose-steam-b0d66d7e?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">shoring up consumer spending</a> .</p><p> Last month, Mao Zhenhua, co-director of Renmin University&#39;s Institute for Economic Research, called on officials to provide direct subsidies for Chinese households to boost consumption. Zhang Jun, a professor at Fudan University, pointed out that China needs to raise household incomes to boost domestic demand instead of plowing more money into infrastructure investments.</p><p> “Well-targeted fiscal stimulus could be helpful in boosting household consumption in the short run as well as growth rebalancing in the longer term,” said Eswar Prasad, professor of trade and economics at Cornell University and a former head of the International Monetary Fund&#39;s China division.</p><p> Policies aimed at boosting consumption, he said, would serve the short-term objective of getting the economy revved up again, as well help meet the longer-term goal of rebalancing the economy away from an overreliance on investment and exports.</p><p> Other steps could include measures to make it easier for Chinese workers to move around to find jobs and more spending in areas such as healthcare, pensions and unemployment insurance.</p><p> But those shifts are unlikely to materialize soon, since such moves will require sweeping changes to the fabric of society that could have a destabilizing effect on tens of millions of people&#39;s lives.</p><p> During past rounds of downturns, including the 2008-09 global financial crisis, Chinese authorities unleashed hundreds of billions of dollars to fuel a multiyear construction boom and stave off a sharp economic slowdown.</p><div class="media-object scope-web

Failure to extend membership to Ukraine—especially if Kyiv remains sidelined from NATO—would leave the country frozen out of Western institutions and exposed to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-pulls-back-from-humanitarian-cooperation-at-u-n-a871ae5d?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Russian influence and aggression</a> for decades, however <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/changing-places-europeans-grow-more-assertive-on-ukraine-as-washington-shows-caution-e4b83acf?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">the current conflict</a> between the two nations ends. Ukrainians would likely see it as a huge betrayal, threatening the viability of their pro-Western leadership.</p><p> Yet EU accession—even for countries not at war and with stronger economies—is an arduous process requiring years of effort to adopt EU rules and law. Enlargement had also lost its zest among West Europeans in the years before Russia&#39;s invasion of Ukraine. A perception that newer EU entrants, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-squeezes-hungary-funding-while-seeking-its-backing-against-russia-11663501887?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">such as Hungary</a> , were backsliding on democratic norms soured many voters on expanding the bloc.</p><p> Ukraine&#39;s next steps are clear. The EU handed Kyiv seven tasks to complete for accession negotiations to begin. An initial report last month showed progress in most areas, including on the country&#39;s media laws and the independence of its Constitutional Court.</p><p> The European Commission, the EU&#39;s executive body, will make a formal progress report in the fall. If positive, diplomats say there will be a strong push for EU leaders to agree in December to begin negotiations.</p><p> European officials have in recent weeks also begun their first discussions of what enlargement would entail for the bloc. EU affairs ministers discussed the issue last month in Sweden, which at that time held the rotating presidency of the bloc.</p><p> A week later, on the sidelines of a Brussels summit, 10 EU leaders, including Macron, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte and German Chancellor</p> Olaf Scholz, held a breakfast meeting to chew the issues over. EU leaders are expected to return to the theme at an October summit.<p></p><p> Diplomats involved in talks say conversations so far have focused on the questions that need addressing. There were some early conclusions. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Treaty change would likely entail national referendums, something most leaders want to avoid.</p><p> Second, it was clear that member states need to start making decisions in the next couple of years to allow for the possibility of enlargement over the next decade. That starts with negotiations on the next multiannual EU budget package, for which talks will likely begin in 2025.</p><p> Many other questions remain unanswered. Failure to settle them could slow or stymie Ukraine&#39;s hopes of membership.</p><p> The biggest challenges will be money, governance and the enlargement process.</p><p> The entrance of Ukraine—whose economy is about one-fifth the size of its neighbor Poland&#39;s and is largely agrarian—would force a huge readjustment of the EU&#39;s biggest spending areas: agricultural assistance and grants for poorer EU regions. The bloc spends around two-thirds of its seven-year budget, totaling more than $1.35 trillion, on those areas.</p><p> Some European officials suggest that Ukraine&#39;s entry into the bloc would, under current rules, turn every other EU country into a net budget contributor. Currently, every member state pays into the budget but poorer ones receive back billions of euros more in EU spending than they pay in. Each EU member will have a veto over enlargement and the bloc&#39;s next budget.</p><p> “The whole architecture of the EU has to change when you want to integrate such a big country as Ukraine,” said Stefan Meister at the German Council on Foreign Relations. “You have to change the whole subsidies system, which is the most attractive part of the EU.”</p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps
          wrap
"></div><p> The bloc will also need to rethink how it makes joint decisions after enlargement, because it is already hard with 27 members. Some EU policies are decided through special majorities, depriving member states of a veto. But many of the biggest policy files require unanimity.</p><p> In a speech last August, Germany&#39;s Scholz said EU enlargement would require an end to vetoes on foreign-policy decisions and on taxation.</p><p> “Where unanimity is required today, the risk of an individual country using its veto…increases with each additional member state,” Scholz said in a speech in Prague. “Anyone who believes anything else is in denial about the reality of Europe.”</p><p> Those ideas, which would need to be backed unanimously, are highly controversial. Smaller member states have long resisted majority decisions on defense and security matters. Ireland, which hosts a number of foreign multinational companies, has led opposition to ending the veto on tax policy.</p><p> The EU will have to decide whether to try to bring Ukraine and all other EU aspirants into the bloc together. That would tie accession of fast-reforming countries to the progress of laggards. But European officials worry that enlarging in several rounds will leave those whose road to membership is slower exposed to Russian pressure and interference.</p><p> A more fundamental debate is over how enlargement happens.</p><p> New members would likely have to accept significant transition periods to win their full rights as EU members. That precedent was set in 2004, when Poland and other new members agreed <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1028057036887219120?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">multiyear restrictions</a> on the rights of their citizens to work elsewhere in the bloc.</p><p> Some politicians, including Macron, have a more radical vision of an enlarged EU where member states would enjoy different levels of integration and different sets of rights and responsibilities within the bloc, a concept that risks disrupting the EU&#39;s single market of goods, services, capital and labor.</p><p> “Yes, it should be enlarged. Yes, it should be rethought very extensively with regard to its governance,” he said in a speech in Slovakia in May. “Yes, it should innovate, undoubtedly to invent several formats and clarify each of their aims.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

They are becoming poorer.</p><p> Life on a continent long envied by outsiders for its <em>art de vivre</em> is rapidly losing its shine as Europeans see their purchasing power melt away.</p><p> The French are eating less foie gras and drinking less red wine.

Across Germany, meat and milk consumption has fallen to the lowest level in three decades and the once-booming market for organic food has tanked. Italy&#39;s economic development minister, Adolfo Urso, convened a crisis meeting in May over prices for pasta, the country&#39;s favorite staple, after they jumped by more than double the national inflation rate.</p><p> With consumption spending in free fall, Europe tipped into recession at the start of the year, reinforcing a sense of relative economic, political and military decline that kicked in at the start of the century. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"><img width="600" height="960" src="https://images.wsj.net/im-818002?width=600" alt="不明确的" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><p> Europe&#39;s current predicament has been long in the making. An aging population with a preference for free time and job security over earnings ushered in years of lackluster economic and productivity growth. Then came the one-two punch of the Covid-19 pandemic and Russia&#39;s protracted war in Ukraine. By upending global supply chains and sending the prices of energy and food rocketing, the crises aggravated ailments that had been festering for decades.</p><p> Governments&#39; responses only compounded the problem. To preserve jobs, they steered their subsidies primarily to employers, leaving consumers without a cash cushion when the price shock came. Americans, by contrast, benefited from inexpensive energy and government aid directed primarily at citizens to keep them spending.</p><p> In the past, the continent&#39;s formidable export industry might have come to the rescue. But a sluggish recovery in China, a critical market for Europe, is undermining that growth pillar. High energy costs and rampant inflation at a level not seen since the 1970s are dulling manufacturers&#39; price advantage in international markets and smashing the continent&#39;s once-harmonious labor relations. As global trade cools, Europe&#39;s heavy reliance on exports—which account for about 50% of eurozone GDP versus 10% for the US—is becoming a weakness.</p><p> Private consumption has declined by about 1% in the 20-nation eurozone since the end of 2019 after adjusting for inflation, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based club of mainly wealthy countries. In the US, where households enjoy a strong labor market and rising incomes, it has increased by nearly 9%. The European Union now accounts for about 18% of all global consumption spending, compared with 28% for America. Fifteen years ago, the EU and the US each represented about a quarter of that total.</p><p> Adjusted for inflation and purchasing power, wages have declined by about 3% since 2019 in Germany, by 3.5% in Italy and Spain and by 6% in Greece. Real wages in the US have increased by about 6% over the same period, according to OECD data. </p><div class="media-object scope-

In Brussels, one of Europe&#39;s richest cities, teachers and nurses stood in line on a recent evening to collect half-price groceries from the back of a truck. The vendor, Happy Hours Market, collects food close to its expiration date from supermarkets and advertises it through an app. Customers can order in the early afternoon and collect their cut-price groceries in the evening.</p><p> “Some customers tell me, because of you I can eat meat two or three times per week,” said Pierre van Hede, who was handing out crates of groceries.</p><p> Karim Bouazza, a 33-year-old nurse who was stocking up on half-price meat and fish for his wife and two children, complained that inflation means “you almost need to work a second job to pay for everything.”</p><p> Similar services have sprung up across the region, marketing themselves as a way to reduce food waste as well as save money. TooGoodToGo, a company founded in Denmark in 2015 that sells leftover food from retailers and restaurants, has 76 million registered users across Europe, roughly three times the number at the end of 2020. In Germany, Sirplus, a startup created in 2017, offers “rescued” food, including products past their sell-by date, on its online store. So does Motatos, created in Sweden in 2014 and now present in Finland, Germany, Denmark and the UK</p><p> Spending on high-end groceries has collapsed. Germans consumed 52 kilograms of meat per person in 2022, about 8% less than the previous year and the lowest level since calculations began in 1989. While some of that reflects societal concerns about healthy eating and animal welfare, experts say the trend has been accelerated by meat prices which increased by up to 30% in recent months. Germans are also swapping meats such as beef and veal for less-expensive ones such as poultry, according to the Federal Information Center for Agriculture.</p><p> Thomas Wolff, an organic-food supplier near Frankfurt, said his sales fell by up to 30% last year as inflation surged. Wolff said he had hired 33 people earlier in the pandemic to handle strong demand for pricey ecological foodstuffs, but he has since let them all go.</p><p> Ronja Ebeling, a 26-year-old consultant and author based in Hamburg, said she saves about one-quarter of her income, partly because she worries about having enough money for retirement. She spends little on clothes or makeup and shares a car with her partner&#39;s father. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

That has left the average EU country poorer per head than every US state except Idaho and Mississippi, according to a report this month by the European Centre for International Political Economy, a Brussels-based independent think tank. If the current trend continues, by 2035 the gap between economic output per capita in the US and EU will be as large as that between Japan and Ecuador today, the report said.</p><p> On the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, businesses are lobbying for more flights to the US to increase the number of free-spending American tourists, said Maria Frontera, president of the Mallorca Chamber of Commerce&#39;s tourism commission. Americans spend about €260 ($292) per day on average on hotels compared with less than €180 ($202) for Europeans.</p><p> “This year we have seen a big change in the behavior of Europeans because of the economic situation we are dealing with,” said Frontera, who recently traveled to Miami to learn how to better cater to American customers. </p><div class="media-object scope-

European governments find the old recipes for fixing the problem are either becoming unaffordable or have stopped working. Three-quarters of a trillion euros in subsidies, tax breaks and other forms of relief have gone to consumers and businesses to offset higher energy costs—something economists say is now itself fueling inflation, defeating the subsidies&#39; purpose.</p><p> Public-spending cuts after the global financial crisis starved Europe&#39;s state-funded healthcare systems, especially the UK&#39;s National Health Service.</p><p> Vivek Trivedi, a 31-year-old anesthesiologist living in Manchester, England, earns about £51,000 ($67,000) per year for a 48-hour workweek. Inflation, which has been about 10% or higher in the UK for nearly a year, is devouring his monthly budget, he says. Trivedi said he shops for groceries in discount retailers and spends less on meals out. Some colleagues turned off their heating entirely over recent months, worried they wouldn&#39;t be able to afford sharply higher costs, he said.</p><p> Noa Cohen, a 28-year old public-affairs specialist in London, says she could quadruple her salary in the same job by leveraging her US passport to move across the Atlantic. Cohen recently got a 10% pay raise after switching jobs, but the increase was completely swallowed by inflation. She says friends are freezing their eggs because they can&#39;t afford children anytime soon, in the hope that they have enough money in future.</p><p> “It feels like a perma-freeze in living standards,” she said. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"><img width="600" height="800" src="https://images.wsj.net/im-818000?width=600" alt="不明确的" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><p> Huw Pill, the Bank of England&#39;s chief economist, warned UK citizens in April that they need to accept that they are poorer and stop pushing for higher wages. “Yes, we&#39;re all worse off,” he said, saying that seeking to offset rising prices with higher wages would only fuel more inflation.</p><p> With European governments needing to increase defense spending and given rising borrowing costs, economists expect taxes to increase, adding pressure on consumers. Taxes in Europe are already high relative to those in other wealthy countries, equivalent to around 40-45% of GDP compared with 27% in the US American workers take home almost three-quarters of their paychecks, including income taxes and Social Security taxes, while French and German workers keep just half.</p><p> The pauperization of Europe has bolstered the ranks of labor unions, which are picking up tens of thousands of members across the continent, reversing a decadeslong decline. </p><div class="media-object scope-

That&#39;s because many are pushing workers&#39; preference for more free time over higher pay, even in a world of spiraling skills shortages.</p><p> IG Metall, Germany&#39;s biggest trade union, is calling for a four-day work week at current salary levels rather than a pay raise for the country&#39;s metalworkers ahead of collective bargaining negotiations this November. Officials say the shorter week would improve workers&#39; health and quality of life while at the same time making the industry more attractive to younger workers.</p><div class="media-object scope-web

"><div class="media-object-rich-text"><h4>分享你的意见</h4><p><em>What is your outlook for the economic health of Europe?加入下面的对话。</em></p></div></div><p> Almost half of employees in Germany&#39;s health industry choose to work around 30 hours per week rather than full time, reflecting tough working conditions, said Frank Werneke, chairman of the country&#39;s United Services Trade Union, which has added about 110,000 new members in recent months, the biggest increase in 22 years.</p><p> Kristian Kallio, a games developer in northern Finland, recently decided to reduce his working week by one-fifth to 30 hours in exchange for a 10% pay cut. He now makes about €2,500 per month. “Who wouldn&#39;t want to work shorter hours?” Kallio said. About one-third of his colleagues took the same deal, although leaders work full-time, said Kallio&#39;s boss, Jaakko Kylmäoja.</p><p> Kallio now works from 10 am to 4.30 pm He uses his extra free time for hobbies, to make good food and take long bike rides. “I don&#39;t see a reality where I would go back to normal working hours,” he said.</p><p> Igor Chaykovskiy, a 34-year-old IT worker in Paris, joined a trade union earlier this year to press for better pay and conditions. He recently received a 3.5% pay increase, about half the level of inflation. He thinks the union will give workers greater leverage to press managers. Still, it isn&#39;t just about pay. “Maybe they say you don&#39;t have an increase in salary, you have free sports lessons or music lessons,” he said. </p><div class="media-object scope-

European governments find the old recipes for fixing the problem are either becoming unaffordable or have stopped working. Three-quarters of a trillion euros in subsidies, tax breaks and other forms of relief have gone to consumers and businesses to offset higher energy costs—something economists say is now itself fueling inflation, defeating the subsidies&#39; purpose.</p><p> Public-spending cuts after the global financial crisis starved Europe&#39;s state-funded healthcare systems, especially the UK&#39;s National Health Service.</p><p> Vivek Trivedi, a 31-year-old anesthesiologist living in Manchester, England, earns about £51,000 ($67,000) per year for a 48-hour workweek. Inflation, which has been about 10% or higher in the UK for nearly a year, is devouring his monthly budget, he says. Trivedi said he shops for groceries in discount retailers and spends less on meals out. Some colleagues turned off their heating entirely over recent months, worried they wouldn&#39;t be able to afford sharply higher costs, he said.</p><p> Noa Cohen, a 28-year old public-affairs specialist in London, says she could quadruple her salary in the same job by leveraging her US passport to move across the Atlantic. Cohen recently got a 10% pay raise after switching jobs, but the increase was completely swallowed by inflation. She says friends are freezing their eggs because they can&#39;t afford children anytime soon, in the hope that they have enough money in future.</p><p> “It feels like a perma-freeze in living standards,” she said. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Taxes in Europe are already high relative to those in other wealthy countries, equivalent to around 40-45% of GDP compared with 27% in the US American workers take home almost three-quarters of their paychecks, including income taxes and Social Security taxes, while French and German workers keep just half.</p><p> The pauperization of Europe has bolstered the ranks of labor unions, which are picking up tens of thousands of members across the continent, reversing a decadeslong decline. </p><div class="media-object scope-

That&#39;s because many are pushing workers&#39; preference for more free time over higher pay, even in a world of spiraling skills shortages.</p><p> IG Metall, Germany&#39;s biggest trade union, is calling for a four-day work week at current salary levels rather than a pay raise for the country&#39;s metalworkers ahead of collective bargaining negotiations this November. Officials say the shorter week would improve workers&#39; health and quality of life while at the same time making the industry more attractive to younger workers.</p><div class="media-object scope-web

He now makes about €2,500 per month. “Who wouldn&#39;t want to work shorter hours?” Kallio said. About one-third of his colleagues took the same deal, although leaders work full-time, said Kallio&#39;s boss, Jaakko Kylmäoja.</p><p> Kallio now works from 10 am to 4.30 pm He uses his extra free time for hobbies, to make good food and take long bike rides. “I don&#39;t see a reality where I would go back to normal working hours,” he said.</p><p> Igor Chaykovskiy, a 34-year-old IT worker in Paris, joined a trade union earlier this year to press for better pay and conditions. He recently received a 3.5% pay increase, about half the level of inflation. He thinks the union will give workers greater leverage to press managers. Still, it isn&#39;t just about pay. “Maybe they say you don&#39;t have an increase in salary, you have free sports lessons or music lessons,” he said. </p><div class="media-object scope-
