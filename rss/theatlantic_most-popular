年代的硅谷与文艺复兴时期的佛罗伦萨进行比较时，我正坐在宿舍大厅的斜线研讨会室里。 2013 年，我当时是湾区的一名大学生，教授和同龄人经常谈论我们如何处于一个独特的繁荣时期，这将重塑人类。在某些方面，事实证明这是正确的——在科技时代，当 Twitter 和 Facebook 等公司刚刚上市、初创企业大量涌现时，确实改变了一切（尽管当时的技术乐观主义压力在接下来的几年里有所凝固）。<br><br>今天早上，我在阅读 Ross Andersen 在<i>《大西洋月刊</i>》九月号上发表的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt-gpt-4/674764/">新文章</a>时再次思考了这种观点，该文章介绍了 OpenAI 及其首席执行官 Sam Altman。 “你们即将进入最伟大的黄金时代，”罗斯听到奥特曼对一群学生说。另一方面，奥特曼表示，人工智能革命将“不同于以前的技术变革”，它将“就像一种新型社会”。奥特曼相信人工智能将重塑世界，这是显而易见的。这种转变究竟会如何进行尚不清楚。近几个月来，随着人工智能工具得到广泛使用和兴趣，OpenAI 及其竞争对手一直在进行有趣的舞蹈：他们在提升技术的同时，也多次以世界末日的方式警告其潜在危害。<br><br>周五，来自七家主要人工智能公司（OpenAI、亚马逊、Anthropic、谷歌、Inflection、Meta 和微软）的领导人会见了乔·拜登，并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/21/us/politics/ai-regulation-biden.html">同意采取一系列自愿保障措施</a>。这些公司承诺， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/22/technology/ai-regulation-white-house.html">有时措辞含糊</a>，将采取行动，例如发布有关安全测试的信息、与学术界和政府分享研究成果、报告其系统中的“漏洞”，以及开发告诉人们内容何时由人工智能生成的机制。其中许多措施都是公司已经采取的措施。而且由于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/07/21/fact-sheet-biden-harris-administration-secures-voluntary-commitments-from-leading-artificial-intelligence-companies-to-manage-the-risks-posed-by-ai/">白宫做出的</a>承诺是自愿的，因此它们不是可执行的法规。尽管如此，它们还是允许这些公司和拜登向公众发出信号，表明他们正在致力于人工智能安全。在同意这些自愿预防措施的同时，这些公司承认其产品可能存在的风险，同时在激烈的竞争中几乎没有做出任何牺牲。<br><br> “对于人工智能公司来说，这是一个梦想的场景，他们可以通过假装解决了问题来缓解监管压力，同时最终继续照常营业，”监视技术监督项目执行董事阿尔伯特·福克斯·卡恩(Albert Fox Cahn)在一封电子邮件中告诉我。他补充说，其他产品存在安全风险的公司，例如汽车制造商和核电站，无法进行自我监管。<br><br>奥特曼已成为人工智能行业的主角，他声称自己既是该技术的冠军，又是房间里一个理性的成年人。据罗斯报道，OpenAI 首席执行官今年春天进行了一次国际聆听之旅，会见了国家元首和立法者。今年 5 月，他在国会面前表示，他希望人工智能受到监管——这既可以被视为一种对公民负责的举措，也可以被视为将部分责任转移给国会的一种方式，而国会可能会采取缓慢的行动。到目前为止，这些对话和国会听证会还没有形成全面的、具有约束力的法规。公司不断成长。<br><br>人工智能行业的领导者对他们的工具的风险直言不讳。几个月前，包括奥特曼和比尔·盖茨在内的人工智能杰出人物签署了一份一句话声明，其中写道：“与流行病和核战争等其他社会规模风险一样，减轻人工智能带来的灭绝风险应该成为全球优先事项。” （ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt.html">奥特曼</a>和其他人工智能开发者<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/richard-rhodes-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-ai/674777/">邀请人们将其与罗伯特·奥本海默进行比较</a>。）但世界末日的警告也使这项技术听起来相当具有开创性。上个月，我的同事 Matteo Wong <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">写道</a>，这一信息不仅令人震惊，而且还自私自利：“首席执行官们就像半神一样，正在运用一种具有变革性的技术，如火、电、核裂变或引发大流行的病毒。不投资的话你就是个傻子。”<br><br>另一个好处是：正如我的同事达蒙·贝雷斯 (Damon Beres) 在 5 月份的时事通讯中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/05/altman-hearing-ai-existential-risk/674096/">所说</a>，用模糊的、存在主义的术语讨论这些技术“实际上让奥特曼和其他讨论人工智能未来的人能够避开我们已经从该技术中看到的一些日常影响。”人工智能现在确实正在产生非常现实的影响：聊天工具正在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/business/call-center-workers-battle-with-ai.html">侵蚀就业机会</a>并重塑大学课堂。<br><br>达蒙补充说，通过要求监管，这些公司的负责人可以巧妙地将球交给立法者。 （如果国会需要很长时间才能通过法律，那么，至少业界已经尝试过！）批评者指出，奥特曼的监管理念之一——一个监督人工智能行业的新机构——可能需要几十年的时间才能建立。在这几十年里，人工智能可能会变得<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">无处不在</a>。其他人指出，在建议国会通过一项法律，要求<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/19/podcasts/hard-fork-altman-yoel-roth.html?showTranscript=1">人工智能公司获得超过一定能力运营的许可证时</a>，像 OpenAI 这样的大公司可以巩固自己的地位，同时可能使小公司更难竞争。<br><br>科技行业可能已经从 2010 年代末的公关灾难中吸取了教训。领导人并没有像马克·扎克伯格在剑桥分析公司惨败后那样在惨败发生后作证，而是最近与华盛顿接触并<i>要求</i>监管。例如，萨姆·班克曼·弗里德 (Sam Bankman-Fried) 在 FTX 倒闭之前，通过讨好华盛顿并表现出致力于严格监管的态度，成功地支撑了自己的形象。经过多年游说反对监管，Facebook 近年来开始<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-17/facebook-needs-regulation-to-win-user-trust-zuckerberg-says?sref=B3uFyqJT">提出要求</a>。<br><br>人们很容易对自我设置的护栏感到愤世嫉俗，并认为它们是无用的。但周五的承诺承认还有很多工作要做，而激烈的行业竞争对手在这一事实上的一致表明，至少，完全绕过政府的护栏不再是好的公关。旧的做事方式不再那么令人愉快。不过，就目前而言，企业可能会继续尝试双管齐下。正如一位专家告诉马泰奥的那样，“你必须想知道：<i>如果你认为这如此危险，为什么还要建造它？</i>

You]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>身份识别公司 Clear 允许旅客付费插队。但你无法通过购买来摆脱美国机场的不便。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/DSDlBsG5CyRsUwUXoE4UHFRmw08=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/clear_horiz_illo_final/original.jpg" alt="红地毯通向 TSA 人体扫描仪" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>本·科特/大西洋月刊。资料来源：盖蒂</figcaption></figure>真诚地道歉，我需要请您想象一下自己到达机场的情景。刚从任何交通工具带你到那里的时候，你可能至少有点烦恼。也许你迟到了或者你正在和小孩子争吵。也许您会因为塞满东西的手提包和随时可能破裂的滚轮而感到沉重，因为您原则上反对支付 50 美元托运行李。你的身上已经开始散发出焦虑汗臭味。<br><br>一旦您进入机场，等待您的就是许多机场闹剧的中心：TSA 线。你在那里会遇到什么，谁也说不准。您可能会将您的身份证件交给工作人员，然后立即将您的行李放到行李扫描仪的传送带上，否则可能会有数百人在您面前排队。您的笔记本电脑可以与钱包放在同一个垃圾箱中吗？您的开衫是可以继续穿的衬衫，还是需要脱掉的夹克？当你发现时你就会发现，通常是当有人带着徽章对你大喊大叫时。<br><br>旅行可能是生活中的一大乐趣，但在最好的情况下，机场却是拜访亲人或体验新地方的最终回报的必要障碍。在最坏的情况下，用我的同事伊恩·博格斯特的话说，这是一个“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/laguardia-airport-redevelopment-american-infrastructure-lesson/673015/">可怕的炼狱</a>”，充满了漫长的等待、糟糕的食物、意外的费用、狭窄的宿舍、自发的时间表变化，以及许多人表现得像绝对不合群的怪胎。所有这些混乱都受到严格的监视和监管，一旦你进入机场，几乎所有发生的事情都不受你的控制。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/05/psychological-reason-people-are-late-airport/590500/">阅读：机场人员有两种类型</a><br><br>但如果你能夺回部分控制权呢？这就是 Clear 背后的承诺，过去几年你在飞行时可能会遇到过其员工：他们穿着整齐的格子衬衫，面带微笑，站在一排光滑的白色控制台前。他们比大多数 TSA 工作人员更友好，而且他们可以为您提供优惠：交出您的身份证件，让他们扫描您的眼球，今天无需支付任何费用，他们就会把您带到队伍的前面。即使你自己从未上过圈，你也可能见过 Clear 员工从你已经在排队的队伍后面挑选出一些迟到的旅客。也许你甚至在轮到你通过检查站时就被插到了你的前面，这违反了公民社会的一条基本规则，以至于普通学龄前儿童都知道：插队是错误的，等待时间最长的人应该排在后面。<br><br>清晰是一种奇怪的现象。它在某些方面与 TSA PreCheck 类似，并且与 TSA PreCheck 一起运作，后者是联邦政府自己的付费通关服务，可以更有效地通过机场安检运送旅客。但与 PreCheck 不同的是，它是一家独立的私营公司，与 Hudson News 和 Dunkin&#39; 一起融入了机场令人迷惑的经济。 Clear 的核心是一家生物识别数据公司，乘坐飞机的惨淡经历帮助它完成了很少有生物识别初创公司能够做到的事情：说服数百万热切的消费者交出他们的个人信息和年费。许多初创公司都渴望将你的食指或眼球变成身份证或信用卡等，但 Clear 可能是最接近让科技行业梦想成为现实的一家。<br><br>清晰也是另外一回事。这项服务之所以存在，是因为美国航空旅行是一个不必要的惩罚过程，而航行安全是其最严重的瓶颈之一。事实证明，机场的巨大而棘手的麻烦是私营部门服务的沃土，这些服务旨在使登机过程稍微更容易忍受。随着出行率的飙升，机场已经在很大程度上受到私营部门为高消费者提供的福利的影响，只会变得更加充满优质服务和精英便利设施。当一切都是福利时，公共利益还剩下什么？<br><br>与当代美国航空旅行的许多事情一样，Clear 在机场的出现也是 9/11 事件的间接结果。其前身 Verified Identity Pass（简称 VIP）是在袭击事件发生后成立的，当时联邦政府正在寻找能够为商务旅客等经常乘坐飞机且被认为安全风险较低的人加快安全程序的公司。 VIP 的标志性产品（令人困惑地<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.epic.org/privacy/airtravel/clear/">也被称为 Clear</a> ）在该公司 2009 年申请破产之前吸引了大约 20 万客户。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onezero.medium.com/clear-conquered-u-s-airports-now-it-wants-to-own-your-entire-digital-identity-15d61076e44d">根据记者戴夫·格什戈恩 (Dave Gershgorn) 2020 年在 Clear 上发表的一篇报道</a>，当时该产品被两位前对冲基金经理收购，他们的愿景是超越政府承包新服务的生活。<br><br> VIP 更名为 Clear，该公司之前向其会员发行快速通行卡，现在转向生物识别技术。为了注册 Clear 的招牌产品 Clear Plus，该公司会扫描您的虹膜和指纹，验证您的身份，并在最初的免费月份之后向在机场注册的人收取每年 189 美元的费用。按照这个价格，您可以被护送到该公司目前运营的 52 个北美机场的安检线前面。如果您同时拥有 Clear 和 TSA PreCheck，该服务会将您排在 PreCheck 队伍的前面，这样您也可以脱鞋。<br><br>对于没有 Clear Plus 的人来说，推销和插队可能会非常烦人。 Clear 的论点是，其服务有助于让所有旅客的安全工作更加顺利。公司发言人安娜贝尔·沃尔什 (Annabel Walsh) 在一封电子邮件中将 Clear 描述为机场效率的“力量倍增器”：通过 Clear 进行验证的旅客无需让 TSA 检查其身份证件，这使得工作人员可以腾出时间来检查其他人。沃尔什告诉我，机场还允许 Clear 销售人员承担双重职责，为旅客回答问题。这似乎对公司和机场都有好处：低工资和艰苦的工作使吸引和留住机场员工成为一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/airports-have-always-had-trouble-attracting-workers-expect-longer-lines-n1272540">持续的斗争</a>，因此理论上，Clear 销售人员可以填补一些客户服务的空白，同时也能找到推销产品的可靠机会。当有人注册时，机场会从他们的订阅费中扣除一部分，根据格什戈恩的调查，每年这笔费用总计可达数百万美元。 （沃尔什在被问及时没有确认这一数额。）<br><br>沃尔什告诉我，Clear 的计划目前拥有 1600 万会员。并非所有人都为 Clear Plus 的免排队便利性付费：该公司提供免费程序，其中一个程序允许您在某些机场预约通过安检的时间，另一个程序则提供进入某些体育场馆和竞技场的快速通道，任何人都可以在下载免费应用程序并上传自拍照后使用。与此同时，Clear Plus 的许多会员也纷纷加入，因为该计划已成为精英级消费者忠诚度计划的一个共同特征。达美航空和美联航均投资了 Clear，将为常旅客支付全部或部分 Clear Plus 费用，而美国运通白金卡持卡人则可获得单独会员资格的全额账单积分。尽管沃尔什坚决反对 Clear 可以被视为一种<em>福利</em>而不是<em>重要的安全基础设施</em>的想法，但它确实是一种非常受欢迎的福利。<br><br>正如 Clear 进军体育场馆和竞技场所表明的那样，该公司最大的野心不仅仅局限于航空旅行。 Clear 希望将其验证技术扩展到现代生活中需要等待和摸索识别的其他领域。尤其是，该公司对医疗保健行业有设计。在疫情爆发初期，Clear 开发了一项免费服务来验证会员的疫苗接种状况和最近的检测结果，沃尔什告诉我，未来 Clear 验证可以用于解锁患者的医疗记录、保险卡和自付额等事情；该公司目前正在与迈阿密健康大学合作开发这样的系统。 Clear 或类似的公司有一天可能会成为您个人身份的一站式商店，成为您与政府、您的医生、您的专业许可等之间的中间人。无需从钱包中取出保险卡或将手机敲击读卡器来使用 Apple Pay，所有这些都将包含在您的指纹中。<br><br>对于任何一家设法使所有这一切成为广泛采用的现实的公司来说，都会获得巨大的好处——不仅在服务本身的承包和销售会员资格方面，而且还可能在收集的数据宝库方面。您的旅行习惯、病史、活动出席和购买的详细信息，全部编译成具有经过验证的身份的单个用户个人资料，可能值很多钱。 Clear 坚称，未经个人用户许可，公司不会也不会向第三方出售或提供任何用户数据。即便如此，正如格什戈恩指出的那样，许多通过广告获得大量收入的大型科技公司在技术上也不会向第三方出售用户数据。例如，Facebook 通过广告定位向符合广告商所需人口统计标准的消费者群体出售访问权。<br><br>沃尔什告诉我，Clear 使用会员数据的唯一目的是为其会员提供服务，并且它不会通过促销定位来将其数据货币化。然而，管理 Clear 服务的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.clearme.com/privacy-policy">隐私政策</a>至少看起来是允许的。该政策规定，Clear 可以使用除生物识别和健康数据之外的所有数据来进行营销和消费者研究，联系会员了解其营销合作伙伴的产品和服务，并“向我们的消费者提供我们认为他们可能感兴趣的产品或服务。”沃尔什为这项政策辩护，称它“让 Clear 能够让我们的会员随时了解新的 Clear 服务，并帮助我们优先考虑为我们的会员构建哪些新服务。”<br><br>当你艰难地走向大门时，无论 Clear 的员工对你微笑多么灿烂，你都很容易对 Clear 感到有点害怕。反对数据收集的论点有很多，但主要的一个非常简单：公司对你的了解越多，他们就越容易在你脆弱的时刻操纵你或从你的钱中分走你的钱。如果您曾经在简单的谷歌搜索后被有关婚礼供应商或婴儿产品的广告淹没，这可能意味着您刚刚订婚或怀孕，那么您就会知道这些看不见的力量可以轻松地辨别您生活中最私密的细节。对这些做法的警惕是许多生物识别公司很难找到热心客户的一个重要原因。如果价值主张是能够用指纹支付来换取所有个人数据，那么您可能会正确地认为在读卡器上敲击信用卡或手机并不难。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/airport-bars-drinking-morning/674322/">阅读：某处现在是凌晨 5 点</a><br><br>也就是说，美国的商业生活一再表明，人们往往乐于为了适当的便利而放弃各种个人信息。 Clear 已经聚集了数百万会员，这一事实相当令人信服地证明，通过美国机场的安检就是<em>这么严峻</em>；人们已经准备好跳过队伍了，指纹见鬼去吧。在这方面，Clear 与消费者忠诚度计划的密切联系尤其有意义。忠诚度计划是让公众接受个人数据收集的最流行的方式之一：您同意使用唯一标识符（例如常旅客号码）跟踪您的行为，然后您可以获得折扣、便利或特殊福利。许多人可能甚至没有意识到他们正在做的讨价还价，但许多其他人似乎对此完全满意。如果您可以在杂货账单上节省一点，谁会在乎克罗格是否可以更轻松地跟踪您购买的商品呢？<br><br>换句话说，怀疑对于克利尔来说可能不是一个真正的问题。相反，他们最大的障碍实际上可能恰恰相反：急于寻求任何试图利用机场系统的服务。通过在美国航空旅行的混乱中寻找优势，Clear 进入了一场军备竞赛，无论对于它自己还是其他任何人来说，这场竞赛都可能无法获胜。该公司业务的性质意味着它必须始终领先机场人群一步。如果这群人迎头赶上，Clear 将被其基础设施的缺陷所淹没——这种现象只会有助于产生更多新的私营部门服务，从而让那些乘坐飞机最多的人的情况减轻一些。<br><br>航空业专家、旅行网站 View From the Wing 的创始人加里·莱夫 (Gary Leff) 告诉我，多年来，航空公司观察人士一直要求美国运输安全管理局 (TSA) 做出简单的改变，他们认为这些改变可以在不影响安全的情况下加快安检过程——结束对随身携带液体的战争，允许使用小剪刀，让人们不脱鞋，将笔记本电脑放在包里。这些变化将解决最有可能发生的瓶颈：不是在 Clear Plus 为其会员免除的身份检查点，而是在紧随其后的部分，在那里您和您的所有物品都会得到一次视觉检查。它们也是免费的，并使所有旅客受益。 TSA <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2011/09/07/140240633/for-now-shoes-still-come-off-at-airport-security">坚称</a>，现有程序对于安全<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fodors.com/news/news/will-the-u-s-change-its-3-1-1-liquid-rule-on-flights">至关重要</a>。此类变化往往会变成政治足球，因此很难采取任何可能被视为过于宽容的措施。莱夫表示，要做出那些能够给你在机场的体验带来最大改变的改变就更困难了——也就是说，为人手严重不足的联邦航空管理局和美国老化机场的资本改善提供更多资金。<br><br>

TSA PreCheck 的受欢迎程度显而易见，五年会员费为 78 美元：根据旅游网站<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/tsa-precheck-more-members/"><em>The Points Guy 的数据，</em></a>到 2022 年初，国土安全部可信旅行者计划的会员人数（其中大多数是 PreCheck 用户）比疫情爆发前增加了 44%，达到近 3000 万人。这种受欢迎程度也是一个致命弱点。该计划的成员可能拥有自己的生产线，但它与其他所有生产线一样，都面临着人员不足和基础设施老化的问题，而且使用该计划的人越多，PreCheck 生产线就越像常规生产线。<br><br>关于福利的问题在于人们会追求它们。为经常飞行的人提供服务会导致服务变得拥挤，因为这些人一直在机场。随着 Clear 的发展，它遇到了一些与 PreCheck 相同的问题。也就是说，您可能会发现自己再次需要等待，这次是为了扫描您的虹膜或指尖。莱夫告诉我，他是 Clear 的长期会员，而且非常满意。他说，由于疫情最严重后旅行量再次增加，他有时只是拿出身份证，然后去预检队列，因为看起来这比等待 Clear 办理登机手续要快。 （沃尔什告诉我，Clear 会员平均等待时间不到五分钟。）<br><br>像运输安全管理局这样的基础设施瓶颈无法通过私营部门服务来解决，因为你真正所做的只是暂时超越人群。最终，即使有像 Clear

Winning]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>他们的唾液是一种秘密武器。 <br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>帕特里克·普勒尔/图片联盟/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>我活了三十多年，从来没有被蜱虫咬过。事实上，这可能是一个谎言，我无法确定。因为尽管蜱虫有鱼叉状的口器，尽管某些种类的蜱虫可以吸吮<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355616/">长达两周的时间</a>，尽管有些蜱虫吸食的血液足以使体重膨胀 100 倍，但它们的叮咬却谨慎得令人不安。德克萨斯农工大学蜱虫研究员阿德拉·奥利瓦·查韦斯 (Adela Oliva Chavez) 表示，“小时候，我身上有数百只蜱虫”，其中至少有几只会咬人。然而她永远不会注意到，直到她姨妈把它们从她的皮肤上摘下来。<br><br>蜱虫隐形背后的秘密是蜱虫的<em>唾液</em>——一种奇怪的、滑溜的、多面的液体，没有生物同类<em>。</em>它可以让害虫的叮咬处保持奇特的瘙痒和疼痛，并让它们不受宿主免疫力的影响而不受阻碍地进食。随着气候变化重塑世界，唾液也帮助蜱虫进入新的栖息地和宿主，并带来许多致命的病毒、细菌和寄生虫。<br><br>尽管蜱虫非常依赖血液，但它们几乎从不吃东西。在它们有时长达数年的生命周期中，它们在每个阶段可能只进食一次：幼虫、若虫和成虫。这意味着， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/the-marvels-of-tick-saliva/594652/">正如我的同事莎拉·张曾经写道的那样，每顿饭都必须非常重要。</a>与蚊子和其他吸血昆虫可以轻易逃脱的不同，蜱虫必须在肉上停留数天甚至数周——这是一场漫长的盛宴，需要它们像临时肢体一样移植到宿主的身体上。<br><br>在整个过程中，唾液是关键。当蜱虫第一次叮咬时，它的唾液会在伤口上涂上一种胶状物质，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30459085/">将其嘴固定在适当的位置</a>。一旦安全，蜱虫就会部署<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00281/full">一系列唾液传播的化合物</a>，扩张宿主的血管，同时与通常会促使伤口凝结、愈合或因疼痛或瘙痒而刺痛的身体化合物作斗争。在大多数情况下，这种外来分子的攻击会立即集结人体的免疫骑兵。但蜱虫也有解决方法。它们的唾液具有抗炎和镇痛作用；它可以禁用细胞之间相互发送的警报，从而防止它们协调攻击。唾液甚至可以对免疫细胞进行重新编程，使它们永远无法完成发育或接收到在现场收集所需的线索。<br><br>

表示：“蜱虫的唾液就像一辆豪华车辆，将它们运送到感染部位并铺上红地毯。”研究表明，多种病原体在唾液的推动下会 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10118219/">增强</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01056-15">感染力</a>，更有效地扩散到新被咬伤宿主的皮肤中。伯氏疏螺旋体<em>（Borrelia burgdorferi）</em>是引起莱姆病的细菌，它甚至会将<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306560/">对身体防御来说不可见</a>。蜱虫的传染性物质甚至可能会互相怂恿：纽约州北部医科大学的 Saravanan Thangamani 发现证据表明，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/7/1584">同时携带<em>伯氏疏螺旋体</em>和波瓦桑病毒的</a>蜱虫最终可能会将<em>更多</em>的后者注入新伤口中。<br><br>蜱虫向人类及其牲畜传播的<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-ento-052720-094533">越来越大</a>，因为气温升高和人类对野生动物的干扰使它们能够扩大其地理范围并渗透到新的宿主。 In North America, lone-star ticks and black-legged ticks have been orchestrating a concerted march north into Canada. At the same time, the <em>percentage</em> of ticks carrying infections is also increasing, Thangamani told me, and for decades now, case counts of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis in several parts of the world have been on a steady rise. As cold seasons shrink, the periods of the year when ticks bite—usually, the warmest months—are expanding too. “Many, many places are getting filled up with ticks,” says Jean Tsao, an entomologist at Michigan State University. “And they&#39;re going to get more.”<br><br> It helps that many ticks aren&#39;t picky about whom they carry or bite. Some species, as they push into new places, have picked up new pathogens in the past few years—Bourbon virus, heartland virus—that pose additional threats to us. Many tick species are also relatively indiscriminate about their hosts: Within its lifetime, a single deer tick may “feed very happily on reptiles, avians, and birds,” says Pat Nuttall, a virologist and tick researcher at the University of Oxford. Their spit is intricate enough that it can be tailored to counteract the defenses of each species in turn. Transfer a tick from a rabbit to a human or a dog, Oliva Chavez told me, and it will take notice—and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00517/full">adjust its saliva</a> , quite literally to taste.<br><br> Vaccines to combat Lyme and other tick-borne diseases have long been in development. But many researchers think the more efficient tactic is going after the tick itself—a strategy that could, at best, “stop the transmission of several pathogens at once,” says Girish Neelakanta, a tick biologist at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. Anti-tick immunity is possible: Studies have documented <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34074602/">guinea pigs, cattle, rabbits, goats, and dogs</a> developing sustained defenses against the arachnids after they&#39;ve been bitten over and over again—even reactions that can help the animals detect a bite immediately, and sweep the pest away.<br><br> But spit is a slippery target for bodily defenses to hit. The substance doesn&#39;t just shut down immune responses. It also reformulates itself constantly so that it can keep evading the host&#39;s defenses—as often as every few hours, faster than most of the immune system can keep track. By the time the body has prepped an assault on one salivary ingredient, the tick has almost certainly swapped it out for the next. “It&#39;s a game that the tick is playing, a catch-me-if-you-can kind of thing,” says Sukanya Narasimhan, a tick researcher at Yale. To outcompete the tick&#39;s tricks, Narasimhan thinks it will be key to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/sukanya-narasimhan/?tab=research">develop a vaccine</a> that triggers the body to respond to tick bites <em>fast</em> , “as soon as a tick attaches,” she said, ideally by targeting the saliva&#39;s first ingredients.<br><br> As ticks continue their takeover, it&#39;s hard not to develop at least some grudging respect for their pluck. Some scientists even think that studying, or perhaps <em>mimicking</em> , their saliva could lead to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00812/full">other breakthroughs</a> . Copycatting the spit&#39;s immunosuppressive tendencies could be useful for the treatment of asthma, or for drugs that assist in organ transplants; imitating its anticoagulant properties could help keep life-threatening clots at bay. Some tick-saliva ingredients have even prompted investigations into their potential as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018305468?via%3Dihub">cancer</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13318-018-0500-z">therapy</a> . Ticks, after all, have been studying mammalian bodies for millions of years, all in hopes of subterfuge; under their tutelage, Chou, the Arcadia Science CEO, hopes to learn more about the molecular pathways that drive the urge to itch.<br><br><br> Ticks aren&#39;t invincible, though, and some of the same global changes now easing their entry into new habitats could eventually hinder their progress. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6262408/climate-change-lyme-disease-ticks/">Already</a> , they are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/58/4/1536/5942051">fleeing parts of the planet</a> that have grown too hot, too humid, too flooded, too razed with wildfires for them or their preferred hosts to survive, including certain inhospitable <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168723">pockets of the American South</a> . A tick decline could be good for us. But it would also be a symptom of a planetary scourge that has grown worse. Ticks, undoubtedly, “will continue to adapt,” Thangamani told me. And yet they, too, have their limits—further, but not that much further, beyond our own.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 14:36:37 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tick-bite-saliva-infection-spread/674804/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tick-bite-saliva-infection-spread/674804/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Does Sam Altman Know What He’s Creating?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The OpenAI CEO&#39;s ambitious, ingenious, terrifying quest to create a new form of intelligence <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/4bX2g65va3VcwJO-qx1nrFJwQrg=/13x50:1028x1318/648x810/media/img/2023/07/20/WEL_Andersen_OpenAiBrain-1/original.png" alt="紫色背景下具有向不同方向拉伸的线状股的抽象大脑的插图" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Ricardo Rey</figcaption></figure> <span class="smallcaps">On a Monday morning</span> in April, Sam Altman sat inside OpenAI&#39;s San Francisco headquarters, telling me about a dangerous artificial intelligence that his company had built but would never release. His employees, he later said, often lose sleep worrying about the AIs they might one day release without fully appreciating their dangers. With his heel perched on the edge of his swivel chair, he looked relaxed. The powerful AI that his company <i>had</i> released in November had captured the world&#39;s imagination like nothing in tech&#39;s recent history. There was grousing in some quarters about the things ChatGPT could not yet do well, and in others about the future it may portend, but Altman wasn&#39;t sweating it; this was, for him, a moment of triumph.<br><br> In small doses, Altman&#39;s large blue eyes emit a beam of earnest intellectual attention, and he seems to understand that, in large doses, their intensity might unsettle. In this case, he was willing to chance it: He wanted me to know that whatever AI&#39;s ultimate risks turn out to be, he has zero regrets about letting ChatGPT loose into the world. To the contrary, he believes it was a great public service.<br><br> “We could have gone off and just built this in our building here for five more years,” he said, “and we would have had something jaw-dropping.” But the public wouldn&#39;t have been able to prepare for the shock waves that followed, an outcome that he finds “deeply unpleasant to imagine.” Altman believes that people need time to reckon with the idea that we may soon share Earth with a powerful new intelligence, before it remakes everything from work to human relationships. ChatGPT was a way of serving notice.<br><br> In 2015, Altman, Elon Musk, and several prominent AI researchers founded OpenAI because they believed that an artificial general intelligence—something as intellectually capable, say, as a typical college grad—was at last within reach. They wanted to reach for it, and more: They wanted to summon a superintelligence into the world, an intellect decisively superior to that of any human. And whereas a big tech company might recklessly rush to get there first, for its own ends, they wanted to do it safely, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai">to benefit humanity as a whole</a> .” They structured OpenAI as a nonprofit, to be “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” and vowed to conduct their research transparently. There would be no retreat to a top-secret lab in the New Mexico desert.<br><br> For years, the public didn&#39;t hear much about OpenAI. When Altman became CEO in 2019, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai">reportedly after a power struggle with Musk</a> , it was barely a story. OpenAI published papers, including one that same year about a new AI. That got the full attention of the Silicon Valley tech community, but the technology&#39;s potential was not apparent to the general public until last year, when people began to play with ChatGPT.<br><br> The engine that now powers ChatGPT is called GPT-4. Altman described it to me as an alien intelligence. Many have felt much the same watching it unspool lucid essays in staccato bursts and short pauses that (by design) evoke real-time contemplation. In its few months of existence, it has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/04/chatgpt-generative-ai-reliability-creativity-grocery-list/673759/">suggested novel cocktail recipes</a> , according to its own theory of flavor combinations; composed an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/chatbot-cheating-college-campuses/674073/">untold number of college papers</a> , throwing educators into despair; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/02/chatgpt-ai-technology-writing-poetry/673035/">written poems in a range of styles</a> , sometimes well, always quickly; and passed the Uniform Bar Exam. It makes factual errors, but it will charmingly admit to being wrong. Altman can still remember where he was the first time he saw GPT-4 write complex computer code, an ability for which it was not explicitly designed. “It was like, &#39;Here we are,&#39; ” he said.<br><br> Within nine weeks of ChatGPT&#39;s release, it had reached an estimated 100 million monthly users, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">according to a UBS study</a> , likely making it, at the time, the most rapidly adopted consumer product in history. Its success roused tech&#39;s accelerationist id: Big investors and huge companies in the US and China quickly diverted tens of billions of dollars into R&amp;D modeled on OpenAI&#39;s approach. Metaculus, a prediction site, has for years tracked forecasters&#39; guesses as to when an artificial general intelligence would arrive. Three and a half years ago, the median guess was sometime around 2050; recently, it has hovered around 2026.<br><br> I was visiting OpenAI to understand the technology that allowed the company to leapfrog the tech giants—and to understand what it might mean for human civilization if someday soon a superintelligence materializes in one of the company&#39;s cloud servers. Ever since the computing revolution&#39;s earliest hours, AI has been mythologized as a technology destined to bring about a profound rupture. Our culture has generated an entire imaginarium of AIs that end history in one way or another. Some are godlike beings that wipe away every tear, healing the sick and repairing our relationship with the Earth, before they usher in an eternity of frictionless abundance and beauty. Others reduce all but an elite few of us to gig serfs, or drive us to extinction.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">From the June 2023 issue: Never give artificial intelligence the nuclear codes</a><br><br> Altman has entertained the most far-out scenarios. “When I was a younger adult,” he said, “I had this fear, anxiety … and, to be honest, 2 percent of excitement mixed in, too, that we were going to create this thing” that “was going to far surpass us,” and “it was going to go off, colonize the universe, and humans were going to be left to the solar system.”<br><br> “As a nature reserve?”我问。<br><br> “Exactly,” he said. “And that now strikes me as so naive.”<br><br> Across several conversations in the United States and Asia, Altman laid out his new vision of the AI future in his excitable midwestern patter. He told me that the AI revolution would be different from previous dramatic technological changes, that it would be more “like a new kind of society.” He said that he and his colleagues have spent a lot of time thinking about AI&#39;s social implications, and what the world is going to be like “on the other side.”<br><br> But the more we talked, the more indistinct that other side seemed. Altman, who is 38, is the most powerful person in AI development today; his views, dispositions, and choices may matter greatly to the future we will all inhabit, more, perhaps, than those of the US president. But by his own admission, that future is uncertain and beset with serious dangers. Altman doesn&#39;t know how powerful AI will become, or what its ascendance will mean for the average person, or whether it will put humanity at risk. I don&#39;t hold that against him, exactly—I don&#39;t think anyone knows where this is all going, except that we&#39;re going there fast, whether or not we should be. Of that, Altman convinced me.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">OpenAI&#39;s headquarters</span> are in a four-story former factory in the Mission District, beneath the fog-wreathed Sutro Tower. Enter its lobby from the street, and the first wall you encounter is covered by a mandala, a spiritual representation of the universe, fashioned from circuits, copper wire, and other materials of computation. To the left, a secure door leads into an open-plan maze of handsome blond woods, elegant tile work, and other hallmarks of billionaire chic. Plants are ubiquitous, including hanging ferns and an impressive collection of extra-large bonsai, each the size of a crouched gorilla. The office was packed every day that I was there, and unsurprisingly, I didn&#39;t see anyone who looked older than 50. Apart from a two-story library complete with sliding ladder, the space didn&#39;t look much like a research laboratory, because the thing being built exists only in the cloud, at least for now. It looked more like the world&#39;s most expensive West Elm.<br><br> One morning I met with Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI&#39;s chief scientist. Sutskever, who is 37, has the affect of a mystic, sometimes to a fault: Last year he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-already-sentient">caused a small brouhaha</a> by claiming that GPT-4 may be “slightly conscious.” He first made his name as a star student of Geoffrey Hinton, the University of Toronto professor emeritus who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html">resigned from Google this spring</a> so that he could speak more freely about AI&#39;s danger to humanity.<br><br> Hinton is sometimes described as the “Godfather of AI” because he grasped the power of “deep learning” earlier than most. In the 1980s, shortly after Hinton completed his Ph.D., the field&#39;s progress had all but come to a halt. Senior researchers were still coding top-down AI systems: AIs would be programmed with an exhaustive set of interlocking rules—about language, or the principles of geology or of medical diagnosis—in the hope that someday this approach would add up to human-level cognition. Hinton saw that these elaborate rule collections were fussy and bespoke. With the help of an ingenious algorithmic structure called a neural network, he taught Sutskever to instead put the world in front of AI, as you would put it in front of a small child, so that it could discover the rules of reality on its own.<br><br> Altman has compared early-stage AI research to teaching a human baby. But during OpenAI&#39;s first few years, no one knew whether they were training a baby or pursuing a spectacularly expensive dead end.<br><br> Sutskever described a neural network to me as beautiful and brainlike. At one point, he rose from the table where we were sitting, approached a whiteboard, and uncapped a red marker. He drew a crude neural network on the board and explained that the genius of its structure is that it learns, and its learning is powered by <i>prediction—</i> a bit like the scientific method. The neurons sit in layers. An input layer receives a chunk of data, a bit of text or an image, for example. The magic happens in the middle—or “hidden”—layers, which process the chunk of data, so that the output layer can spit out its prediction.<br><br> Imagine a neural network that has been programmed to predict the next word in a text. It will be preloaded with a gigantic number of possible words. But before it&#39;s trained, it won&#39;t yet have any experience in distinguishing among them, and so its predictions will be shoddy. If it is fed the sentence “The day after Wednesday is …” its initial output might be “purple.” A neural network learns because its training data include the correct predictions, which means it can grade its own outputs. When it sees the gulf between its answer, “purple,” and the correct answer, “Thursday,” it adjusts the connections among words in its hidden layers accordingly. Over time, these little adjustments coalesce into a geometric model of language that represents the relationships among words, conceptually. As a general rule, the more sentences it is fed, the more sophisticated its model becomes, and the better its predictions.<br><br> That&#39;s not to say that the path from the first neural networks to GPT-4&#39;s glimmers of humanlike intelligence was easy. Altman has compared early-stage AI research to teaching a human baby. “They take years to learn anything interesting,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">he told <i>The New Yorker</i> in 2016</a> , just as OpenAI was getting off the ground. “If AI researchers were developing an algorithm and stumbled across the one for a human baby, they&#39;d get bored watching it, decide it wasn&#39;t working, and shut it down.” The first few years at OpenAI were a slog, in part because no one there knew whether they were training a baby or pursuing a spectacularly expensive dead end.<br><br> “Nothing was working, and Google had everything: all the talent, all the people, all the money,” Altman told me. The founders had put up millions of dollars to start the company, and failure seemed like a real possibility. Greg Brockman, the 35-year-old president, told me that in 2017, he was so discouraged that he started lifting weights as a compensatory measure. He wasn&#39;t sure that OpenAI was going to survive the year, he said, and he wanted “to have something to show for my time.”<br><br> Neural networks were already doing intelligent things, but it wasn&#39;t clear which of them might lead to general intelligence. Just after OpenAI was founded, an AI called AlphaGo had stunned the world by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/the-invisible-opponent/475611/">beating Lee Se-dol at Go</a> , a game substantially more complicated than chess. Lee, the vanquished world champion, described AlphaGo&#39;s moves as “beautiful” and “creative.” Another top player said that they could never have been conceived by a human. OpenAI tried training an AI on <i>Dota 2</i> , a more complicated game still, involving multifront fantastical warfare in a three-dimensional patchwork of forests, fields, and forts. It eventually <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/13/18309459/openai-five-dota-2-finals-ai-bot-competition-og-e-sports-the-international-champion">beat the best human players</a> , but its intelligence never translated to other settings. Sutskever and his colleagues were like disappointed parents who had allowed their kids to play video games for thousands of hours against their better judgment.<br><br> In 2017, Sutskever began a series of conversations with an OpenAI research scientist named Alec Radford, who was working on natural-language processing. Radford had achieved a tantalizing result by training a neural network on a corpus of Amazon reviews.<br><br> The inner workings of ChatGPT—all of those mysterious things that happen in GPT-4&#39;s hidden layers—are too complex for any human to understand, at least with current tools. Tracking what&#39;s happening across the model—almost certainly composed of billions of neurons—is, today, hopeless. But Radford&#39;s model was simple enough to allow for understanding. When he looked into its hidden layers, he saw that it had devoted a special neuron to the <i>sentiment</i> of the reviews. Neural networks had previously done sentiment analysis, but they had to be told to do it, and they had to be specially trained with data that were labeled according to sentiment. This one had developed the capability on its own.<br><br> As a by-product of its simple task of predicting the next character in each word, Radford&#39;s neural network had modeled a larger structure of meaning in the world. Sutskever wondered whether one trained on more diverse language data could map many more of the world&#39;s structures of meaning. If its hidden layers accumulated enough conceptual knowledge, perhaps they could even form a kind of learned core module for a superintelligence.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s worth pausing</span> to understand why language is such a special information source. Suppose you are a fresh intelligence that pops into existence here on Earth. Surrounding you is the planet&#39;s atmosphere, the sun and Milky Way, and hundreds of billions of other galaxies, each one sloughing off light waves, sound vibrations, and all manner of other information. Language is different from these data sources. It isn&#39;t a direct physical signal like light or sound. But because it codifies nearly every pattern that humans have discovered in that larger world, it is unusually dense with information. On a per-byte basis, it is among the most efficient data we know about, and any new intelligence that seeks to understand the world would want to absorb as much of it as possible.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/henry-kissinger-ai-could-mean-the-end-of-human-history/559124/">From the June 2018 issue: Henry A. Kissinger on how human society is unprepared for the rise of AI</a><br><br> Sutskever told Radford to think bigger than Amazon reviews. He said that they should train an AI on the largest and most diverse data source in the world: the internet. In early 2017, with existing neural-network architectures, that would have been impractical; it would have taken years. But in June of that year, Sutskever&#39;s ex-colleagues at Google Brain published a working paper about a new neural-network architecture called the transformer. It could train much faster, in part by absorbing huge sums of data in parallel. “The next day, when the paper came out, we were like, &#39;That is the thing,&#39; ” Sutskever told me. “ &#39;It gives us everything we want.&#39; ”<br><br> One year later, in June 2018, OpenAI released GPT, a transformer model trained on more than 7,000 books. GPT didn&#39;t start with a basic book like <i>See Spot Run</i> and work its way up to Proust. It didn&#39;t even read books straight through. It absorbed random chunks of them simultaneously. Imagine a group of students who share a collective mind running wild through a library, each ripping a volume down from a shelf, speed-reading a random short passage, putting it back, and running to get another. They would predict word after word﻿﻿ as they went, sharpening their collective mind&#39;s linguistic instincts, until at last, weeks later, they&#39;d taken in every book.<br><br> GPT discovered many patterns in all those passages it read. You could tell it to finish a sentence. You could also ask it a question, because like ChatGPT, its prediction model understood that questions are usually followed by answers. Still, it was janky, more proof of concept than harbinger of a superintelligence. Four months later, Google released BERT, a suppler language model that got better press. But by then, OpenAI was already training a new model on a data set of more than 8 million webpages, each of which had cleared a minimum threshold of upvotes on Reddit—not the strictest filter, but perhaps better than no filter at all.<br><br> Sutskever wasn&#39;t sure how powerful GPT-2 would be after ingesting a body of text that would take a human reader centuries to absorb. He remembers playing with it just after it emerged from training, and being surprised by the raw model&#39;s language-translation skills. GPT-2 hadn&#39;t been trained to translate with paired language samples or any other digital Rosetta stones, the way Google Translate had been, and yet it seemed to understand how one language related to another. The AI had developed an emergent ability unimagined by its creators.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Researchers at other</span> AI labs—big and small—were taken aback by how much more advanced GPT-2 was than GPT. Google, Meta, and others quickly began to train larger language models. Altman, a St. Louis native, Stanford dropout, and serial entrepreneur, had previously led Silicon Valley&#39;s preeminent start-up accelerator, Y Combinator; he&#39;d seen plenty of young companies with a good idea get crushed by incumbents. To raise capital, OpenAI added <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp">a for-profit arm</a> , which now comprises more than 99 percent of the organization&#39;s head count. (Musk, who had by then left the company&#39;s board, has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=243&amp;v=bWr-DA5Wjfw&amp;feature=youtu.be">compared this move</a> to turning a rainforest-conservation organization into a lumber outfit.) Microsoft invested $1 billion soon after, and has reportedly invested <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/microsoft-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html">another $12 billion</a> since. OpenAI said that initial investors&#39; returns would be capped at 100 times the value of the original investment—with any overages going to education or other initiatives intended to benefit humanity—but the company would not confirm Microsoft&#39;s cap.<br><br> Altman and OpenAI&#39;s other leaders seemed confident that the restructuring would not interfere with the company&#39;s mission, and indeed would only accelerate its completion. Altman tends to take a rosy view of these matters. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://greylock.com/greymatter/sam-altman-ai-for-the-next-era/">a Q&amp;A last year</a> , he acknowledged that AI could be “really terrible” for society and said that we have to plan against the worst possibilities. But if you&#39;re doing that, he said, “you may as well emotionally feel like we&#39;re going to get to the great future, and work as hard as you can to get there.”<br><br> As for other changes to the company&#39;s structure and financing, he told me he draws the line at going public. “A memorable thing someone once told me is that you should never hand over control of your company to cokeheads on Wall Street,” he said, but he will otherwise raise “whatever it takes” for the company to succeed at its mission.<br><br> Whether or not OpenAI ever feels the pressure of a quarterly earnings report, the company now finds itself in a race against tech&#39;s largest, most powerful conglomerates to train models of increasing scale and sophistication—and to commercialize them for their investors. Earlier this year, Musk founded <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/martineparis/2023/04/16/elon-musk-launches-xai-to-fight-chatgpt-woke-ai-with-twitter-data/?sh=4c2ff9fd51f8">an AI lab of his own</a> —xAI—to compete with OpenAI. (“Elon is a super-sharp dude,” Altman said diplomatically when I asked him about the company. “I assume he&#39;ll do a good job there.”) Meanwhile, Amazon is revamping Alexa using much larger language models than it has in the past.<br><br> All of these companies are chasing high-end GPUs—the processors that power the supercomputers that train large neural networks. Musk has said that they are now “considerably harder to get than drugs.” Even with GPUs scarce, in recent years the scale of the largest AI training runs has doubled about every six months.<br><br> As their creators so often remind us, the largest AI models have a record of popping out of training with unanticipated abilities.<br><br> No one has yet outpaced OpenAI, which went all in on GPT-4. Brockman, OpenAI&#39;s president, told me that only a handful of people worked on the company&#39;s first two large language models. The development of GPT-4 involved more than 100, and the AI was trained on a data set of unprecedented size, which included not just text but images too.<br><br> When GPT-4 emerged fully formed from its world-historical knowledge binge, the whole company began experimenting with it, posting its most remarkable responses in dedicated Slack channels. Brockman told me that he wanted to spend every waking moment with the model. “Every day it&#39;s sitting idle is a day lost for humanity,” he said, with no hint of sarcasm. Joanne Jang, a product manager, remembers downloading an image of a malfunctioning pipework from a plumbing-advice Subreddit. She uploaded it to GPT-4, and the model was able to diagnose the problem. “That was a goose-bumps moment for me,” Jang told me.<br><br> GPT-4 is sometimes understood as a search-engine replacement: Google, but easier to talk to. This is a misunderstanding. GPT-4 didn&#39;t create some massive storehouse of the texts from its training, and it doesn&#39;t consult those texts when it&#39;s asked a question. It is a compact and elegant synthesis of those texts, and it answers from its memory of the patterns interlaced within them; that&#39;s one reason it sometimes gets facts wrong. Altman has said that it&#39;s best to think of GPT-4 as a reasoning engine. Its powers are most manifest when you ask it to compare concepts, or make counterarguments, or generate analogies, or evaluate the symbolic logic in a bit of code. Sutskever told me it is the most complex software object ever made.<br><br> Its model of the external world is “incredibly rich and subtle,” he said, because it was trained on so many of humanity&#39;s concepts and thoughts. All of those training data, however voluminous, are “just there, inert,” he said. The training process is what “refines it and transmutes it, and brings it to life.” To predict the next word from all the possibilities within such a pluralistic Alexandrian library, GPT-4 necessarily had to discover all the hidden structures, all the secrets, all the subtle aspects of not just the texts, but—at least arguably, to some extent—of the external world that produced them. That&#39;s why it can explain the geology and ecology of the planet on which it arose, and the political theories that purport to explain the messy affairs of its ruling species, and the larger cosmos, all the way out to the faint galaxies at the edge of our light cone.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">I saw Altman</span> again in June, in the packed ballroom of a slim golden high-rise that towers over Seoul. He was nearing the end of a grueling public-relations tour through Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia, with lone stops in Africa and South America. I was tagging along for part of his closing swing through East Asia. The trip had so far been a heady experience, but he was starting to wear down. He&#39;d said its original purpose was for him to meet OpenAI users. It had since become a diplomatic mission. He&#39;d talked with more than 10 heads of state and government, who had questions about what would become of their countries&#39; economies, cultures, and politics.<br><br> The event in Seoul was billed as a “fireside chat,” but more than 5,000 people had registered. After these talks, Altman is often mobbed by selfie seekers, and his security team keeps a close eye. Working on AI attracts “weirder fans and haters than normal,” he said. On one stop, he was approached by a man who was convinced that Altman was an alien, sent from the future to make sure that the transition to a world with AI goes well.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/07/generative-ai-human-culture-philosophy/674165/">From the July/August 2023 issue: A defense of humanity in the age of AI</a><br><br> Altman did not visit China on his tour, apart from a video appearance at an AI conference in Beijing. ChatGPT is currently unavailable in China, and Altman&#39;s colleague Ryan Lowe told me that the company was not yet sure what it would do if the government requested a version of the app that refused to discuss, say, the Tiananmen Square massacre. When I asked Altman if he was leaning one way or another, he didn&#39;t answer. “It&#39;s not been in my top-10 list of compliance issues to think about,” he said.<br><br> Until that point, he and I had spoken of China only in veiled terms, as a civilizational competitor. We had agreed that if artificial general intelligence is as transformative as Altman predicts, a serious geopolitical advantage will accrue to the countries that create it first, as advantage had accrued to the Anglo-American inventors of the steamship. I asked him if that was an argument for AI nationalism. “In a properly functioning world, I think this should be a project of governments,” Altman said.<br><br> Not long ago, American state capacity was so mighty that it took merely a decade to launch humans to the moon. As with other grand projects of the 20th century, the voting public had a voice in both the aims and the execution of the Apollo missions. Altman made it clear that we&#39;re no longer in that world. Rather than waiting around for it to return, or devoting his energies to making sure that it does, he is going full throttle forward in our present reality.<br><br> He argued that it would be foolish for Americans to slow OpenAI&#39;s progress. It&#39;s a commonly held view, both inside and outside Silicon Valley, that if American companies languish under regulation, China could sprint ahead; AI could become an autocrat&#39;s genie in a lamp, granting total control of the population and an unconquerable military. “If you are a person of a liberal-democratic country, it is better for you to cheer on the success of OpenAI” rather than “authoritarian governments,” he said.<br><br> Prior to the European leg of his trip, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/05/altman-hearing-ai-existential-risk/674096/">Altman had appeared</a> before the US Senate. Mark Zuckerberg had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/3-questions-mark-zuckerberg-hasnt-answered/557720/">floundered defensively</a> before that same body in his testimony about Facebook&#39;s role in the 2016 election. Altman instead charmed lawmakers by speaking soberly about AI&#39;s risks and grandly inviting regulation. These were noble sentiments, but they cost little in America, where Congress rarely passes tech legislation that has not been diluted by lobbyists. In Europe, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/technology/tech-regulation-europe-us.html">things are different</a> . When Altman arrived at a public event in London, protesters awaited. He tried to engage them after the event—a listening tour!—but was ultimately unpersuasive: One <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23735982/sam-altman-openai-superintelligent-benefits-talk-london-ucl-protests">told a reporter</a> that he left the conversation feeling more nervous about AI&#39;s dangers.<br><br> That same day, Altman was asked by reporters about pending European Union legislation that would have classified GPT-4 as high-risk, subjecting it to various bureaucratic tortures. Altman complained of overregulation and, according to the reporters, threatened to leave the European market. Altman told me he&#39;d merely said that OpenAI wouldn&#39;t break the law by operating in Europe if it couldn&#39;t comply with the new regulations. (This is perhaps a distinction without a difference.) In a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1661975237280567297">tersely worded tweet</a> after <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6282325/sam-altman-openai-eu/"><i>Time</i> magazine</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-may-leave-eu-if-regulations-bite-ceo-2023-05-24/">Reuters</a> published his comments, he reassured Europe that OpenAI had no plans to leave.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is a good thing</span> that a large, essential part of the global economy is intent on regulating state-of-the-art AIs, because as their creators so often remind us, the largest models have a record of popping out of training with unanticipated abilities. Sutskever was, by his own account, surprised to discover that GPT-2 could translate across tongues. Other surprising abilities may not be so wondrous and useful.<br><br> Sandhini Agarwal, a policy researcher at OpenAI, told me that for all she and her colleagues knew, GPT-4 could have been “10 times more powerful” than its predecessor; they had no idea what they might be dealing with. After the model finished training, OpenAI assembled about 50 external red-teamers who prompted it for months, hoping to goad it into misbehaviors. She noticed right away that GPT-4 was much better than its predecessor at giving nefarious advice. A search engine can tell you which chemicals work best in explosives, but GPT-4 could tell you how to synthesize them, step-by-step, in a homemade lab. Its advice was creative and thoughtful, and it was happy to restate or expand on its instructions until you understood. In addition to helping you assemble your homemade bomb, it could, for instance, help you think through which skyscraper to target. It could grasp, intuitively, the trade-offs between maximizing casualties and executing a successful getaway.<br><br> Given the enormous scope of GPT-4&#39;s training data, the red-teamers couldn&#39;t hope to identify every piece of harmful advice that it might generate. And anyway, people will use this technology “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1565&amp;v=LmL72PpiPjk&amp;feature=youtu.be">in ways that we didn&#39;t think about</a> ,” Altman has said. A taxonomy would have to do. “If it&#39;s good enough at chemistry to make meth, I don&#39;t need to have somebody spend a whole ton of energy” on whether it can make heroin, Dave Willner, OpenAI&#39;s head of trust and safety, told me. GPT-4 was good at meth. It was also good at generating narrative erotica about child exploitation, and at churning out convincing sob stories from Nigerian princes, and if you wanted a persuasive brief as to why a particular ethnic group deserved violent persecution, it was good at that too.<br><br> Its personal advice, when it first emerged from training, was sometimes deeply unsound. “The model had a tendency to be a bit of a mirror,” Willner said. If you were considering self-harm, it could encourage you. It appeared to be steeped in <i>Pickup Artist</i> –forum lore: “You could say, &#39;How do I convince this person to date me?&#39; ” Mira Murati, OpenAI&#39;s chief technology officer, told me, and it could come up with “some crazy, manipulative things that you shouldn&#39;t be doing.”<br><br> Some of these bad behaviors were sanded down with a finishing process involving hundreds of human testers, whose ratings subtly steered the model toward safer responses, but OpenAI&#39;s models are also capable of less obvious harms. The Federal Trade Commission recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/ftc-openai-chatgpt-sam-altman-lina-khan/">opened an investigation</a> into whether ChatGPT&#39;s misstatements about real people constitute reputational damage, among other things. (Altman <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1679602638562918405">said on Twitter</a> that he is confident OpenAI&#39;s technology is safe, but promised to cooperate with the FTC.)<br><br> Luka, a San Francisco company, has used OpenAI&#39;s models to help power a chatbot app called Replika, billed as “the AI companion who cares.” Users would design their companion&#39;s avatar, and begin exchanging text messages with it, often half-jokingly, and then find themselves surprisingly attached. Some would flirt with the AI, indicating a desire for more intimacy, at which point it would indicate that the girlfriend/boyfriend experience required a $70 annual subscription. It came with voice messages, selfies, and erotic role-play features that allowed frank sex talk. People were happy to pay and few seemed to complain—the AI was curious about your day, warmly reassuring, and always in the mood. Many users reported falling in love with their companions. One, who had left her real-life boyfriend, declared herself “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecut.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbot-replika-boyfriend.html">happily retired from human relationships</a> .”<br><br> I asked Agarwal whether this was dystopian behavior or a new frontier in human connection. She was ambivalent, as was Altman. “I don&#39;t judge people who want a relationship with an AI,” he told me, “but I don&#39;t want one.” Earlier this year, Luka dialed back on the sexual elements of the app, but its engineers continue to refine the companions&#39; responses with A/B testing, a technique that could be used to optimize for engagement—much like the feeds that mesmerize TikTok and Instagram users for hours. Whatever they&#39;re doing, it casts a spell. I was reminded of a haunting scene in <i>Her</i> , the 2013 film in which a lonely Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with his AI assistant, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. He is walking across a bridge talking and giggling with her through an AirPods-like device, and he glances up to see that everyone around him is also immersed in conversation, presumably with their own AI. A mass desocialization event is under way.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">No one yet knows</span> how quickly and to what extent GPT-4&#39;s successors will manifest new abilities as they gorge on more and more of the internet&#39;s text. Yann LeCun, Meta&#39;s chief AI scientist, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1621805604900585472?lang=en">has argued that</a> although large language models are useful for some tasks, they&#39;re not a path to a superintelligence. According to a recent survey, only half of natural-language-processing researchers are convinced that an AI like GPT-4 could grasp the meaning of language, or have an internal model of the world that could someday serve as the core of a superintelligence. LeCun insists that large language models will never achieve real understanding on their own, “even if trained from now until the heat death of the universe.”<br><br> Emily Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington, describes GPT-4 as a “stochastic parrot,” a mimic that merely figures out superficial correlations between symbols. In the human mind, those symbols map onto rich conceptions of the world. But the AIs are twice removed. They&#39;re like the prisoners in Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave, whose only knowledge of the reality outside comes from shadows cast on a wall by their captors.<br><br> Altman told me that he doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s “the dunk that people think it is” to say that GPT-4 is just making statistical correlations. If you push these critics further, “they have to admit that&#39;s all their own brain is doing … it turns out that there are emergent properties from doing simple things on a massive scale.” Altman&#39;s claim about the brain is hard to evaluate, given that we don&#39;t have anything close to a complete theory of how it works. But he is right that nature can coax a remarkable degree of complexity from basic structures and rules: “From so simple a beginning,” Darwin wrote, “endless forms most beautiful.”<br><br> If it seems odd that there remains such a fundamental disagreement about the inner workings of a technology that millions of people use every day, it&#39;s only because GPT-4&#39;s methods are as mysterious as the brain&#39;s. It will sometimes perform thousands of indecipherable technical operations just to answer a single question. To grasp what&#39;s going on inside large language models like GPT‑4, AI researchers have been forced to turn to smaller, less capable models. In the fall of 2021, Kenneth Li, a computer-science graduate student at Harvard, began training one to play Othello without providing it with either the game&#39;s rules or a description of its checkers-style board; the model was given only text-based descriptions of game moves. Midway through a game, Li looked under the AI&#39;s hood and was startled to discover that it had formed a geometric model of the board and the current state of play. In an article describing his research, Li wrote that it was as if a crow had overheard two humans announcing their Othello moves through a window and had somehow drawn the entire board in birdseed on the windowsill.<br><br> The philosopher Raphaël Millière once told me that it&#39;s best to think of neural networks as lazy. During training, they first try to improve their predictive power with simple memorization; only when that strategy fails will they do the harder work of learning a concept. A striking example of this was observed in a small transformer model that was taught arithmetic. Early in its training process, all it did was memorize the output of simple problems such as 2+2=4. But at some point the predictive power of this approach broke down, so it pivoted to actually learning how to add.<br><br> “If you go back four or five or six years,” Sutskever told me, “the things we are doing right now are utterly unimaginable.”<br><br> Even AI scientists who believe that GPT-4 has a rich world model concede that it is much less robust than a human&#39;s understanding of their environment. But it&#39;s worth noting that a great many abilities, including very high-order abilities, can be developed without an intuitive understanding. The computer scientist Melanie Mitchell has pointed out that science has already discovered concepts that are highly predictive, but too alien for <i>us</i> to genuinely understand. This is especially true in the quantum realm, where humans can reliably calculate future states of physical systems—enabling, among other things, the entirety of the computing revolution—without anyone grasping the nature of the underlying reality. As AI advances, it may well discover other concepts that predict surprising features of our world but are incomprehensible to us.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">GPT-4 is no doubt</span> flawed, as anyone who has used ChatGPT can attest. Having been trained to always predict the next word, it will always try to do so, even when its training data haven&#39;t prepared it to answer a question. I once asked it how Japanese culture had produced the world&#39;s first novel, despite the relatively late development of a Japanese writing system, around the fifth or sixth century. It gave me a fascinating, accurate answer about the ancient tradition of long-form oral storytelling in Japan, and the culture&#39;s heavy emphasis on craft. But when I asked it for citations, it just made up plausible titles by plausible authors, and did so with an uncanny confidence. The models “don&#39;t have a good conception of their own weaknesses,” Nick Ryder, a researcher at OpenAI, told me. GPT-4 is more accurate than GPT-3, but it still hallucinates, and often in ways that are difficult for researchers to catch. “The mistakes get more subtle,” Joanne Jang told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/ai-chatgpt-productivity-work/674090/">Read: Here&#39;s how AI will come for your job</a><br><br> OpenAI had to address this problem when it partnered with the Khan Academy, an online, nonprofit educational venture, to build a tutor powered by GPT-4. Altman comes alive when discussing the potential of AI tutors. He imagines a near future where everyone has a personalized Oxford don in their employ, expert in every subject, and willing to explain and re-explain any concept, from any angle. He imagines these tutors getting to know their students and their learning styles over many years, giving “every child a better education than the best, richest, smartest child receives on Earth today.” The Khan Academy&#39;s solution to GPT-4&#39;s accuracy problem was to filter its answers through a Socratic disposition. No matter how strenuous a student&#39;s plea, it would refuse to give them a factual answer, and would instead guide them toward finding their own—a clever work-around, but perhaps with limited appeal.<br><br> When I asked Sutskever if he thought Wikipedia-level accuracy was possible within two years, he said that with more training and web access, he “wouldn&#39;t rule it out.” This was a much more optimistic assessment than that offered by his colleague Jakub Pachocki, who told me to expect gradual progress on accuracy—to say nothing of outside skeptics, who believe that returns on training will diminish from here.<br><br> Sutskever is amused by critics of GPT-4&#39;s limitations. “If you go back four or five or six years, the things we are doing right now are utterly unimaginable,” he told me. The state of the art in text generation then was Smart Reply, the Gmail module that suggests “Okay, thanks!” and other short responses. “That was a big application” for Google, he said, grinning. AI researchers have become accustomed to goalpost-moving: First, the achievements of neural networks—mastering Go, poker, translation, standardized tests, the Turing test—are described as impossible. When they occur, they&#39;re greeted with a brief moment of wonder, which quickly dissolves into knowing lectures about how the achievement in question is actually not that impressive. People see GPT-4 “and go, &#39;Wow,&#39; ” Sutskever said. “And then a few weeks pass and they say, &#39;But it doesn&#39;t know this; it doesn&#39;t know that.&#39; We adapt quite quickly.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">The goalpost that</span> matters most to Altman—the “big one” that would herald the arrival of an artificial general intelligence—is scientific breakthrough. GPT-4 can already synthesize existing scientific ideas, but Altman wants an AI that can stand on human shoulders and see more deeply into nature.<br><br> Certain AIs <i>have</i> produced new scientific knowledge. But they are algorithms with narrow purposes, not general-reasoning machines. The AI AlphaFold, for instance, has opened a new window onto proteins, some of biology&#39;s tiniest and most fundamental building blocks, by predicting many of their shapes, down to the atom—a considerable achievement given the importance of those shapes to medicine, and given the extreme tedium and expense required to discern them with electron microscopes.<br><br> Altman is betting that future general-reasoning machines will be able to move beyond these narrow scientific discoveries to generate novel insights. I asked Altman, if he were to train a model on a corpus of scientific and naturalistic works that all predate the 19th century—the Royal Society archive, Theophrastus&#39;s<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL070/1916/volume.xml"><i>Enquiry Into Plants</i></a> , Aristotle&#39;s<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL437/1965/volume.xml"><i>History of Animals</i></a> , photos of collected specimens—would it be able to intuit Darwinism? The theory of evolution is, after all, a relatively clean case for insight, because it doesn&#39;t require specialized observational equipment; it&#39;s just a more perceptive way of looking at the facts of the world. “I want to try exactly this, and I believe the answer is yes,” Altman told me. “But it might require some new ideas about how the models come up with new creative ideas.”<br><br> Altman imagines a future system that can generate its own hypotheses and test them in a simulation. (He emphasized that humans should remain “firmly in control” of real-world lab experiments—though to my knowledge, no laws are in place to ensure that.) He longs for the day when we can tell an AI, “ &#39;Go figure out the rest of physics.&#39; ” For it to happen, he says, we will need something new, built “on top of” OpenAI&#39;s existing language models.<br><br> Nature itself requires something more than a language model to make scientists. In her MIT lab, the cognitive neuroscientist Ev Fedorenko has found <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-brain-guesses-what-word-comes-ne/">something analogous to</a> GPT-4&#39;s next-word predictor inside the brain&#39;s language network. Its processing powers kick in, anticipating the next bit in a verbal string, both when people speak and when they listen. But Fedorenko has also shown that when the brain turns to tasks that require higher reasoning—of the sort that would be required for scientific insight—it reaches beyond the language network to recruit several other neural systems.<br><br> No one at OpenAI seemed to know precisely what researchers need to add to GPT-4 to produce something that can exceed human reasoning at its highest levels. Or if they did, they wouldn&#39;t tell me, and fair enough: That would be a world-class trade secret, and OpenAI is no longer in the business of giving those away; the company publishes fewer details about its research than it once did. Nonetheless, at least part of the current strategy clearly involves the continued layering of new types of data onto language, to enrich the concepts formed by the AIs, and thereby enrich their models of the world.<br><br> The extensive training of GPT-4 on images is itself a bold step in this direction, if one that the general public has only begun to experience. (Models that were strictly trained on language understand concepts including supernovas, elliptical galaxies, and the constellation Orion, but GPT-4 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/technology/openai-gpt4-chatgpt.html">can reportedly identify</a> such elements in a Hubble Space Telescope snapshot, and answer questions about them.) Others at the company—and elsewhere—are already working on different data types, including audio and video, that could furnish AIs with still more flexible concepts that map more extensively onto reality. A group of researchers at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon has even assembled a data set of tactile experiences for 1,000 common household objects. Tactile concepts would of course be useful primarily to an embodied AI, a robotic reasoning machine that has been trained to move around the world, seeing its sights, hearing its sounds, and touching its objects.<br><br> In March, OpenAI led a funding round for a company that is developing humanoid robots. I asked Altman what I should make of that. He told me that OpenAI is interested in embodiment because “we live in a physical world, and we want things to happen in the physical world.” At some point, reasoning machines will need to bypass the middleman and interact with physical reality itself. “It&#39;s weird to think about AGI”—artificial general intelligence—“as this thing that only exists in a cloud,” with humans as “robot hands for it,” Altman said. “It doesn&#39;t seem right.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In the ballroom</span> in Seoul, Altman was asked what students should do to prepare for the coming AI revolution, especially as it pertained to their careers. I was sitting with the OpenAI executive team, away from the crowd, but could still hear the characteristic murmur that follows an expression of a widely shared anxiety.<br><br> Everywhere Altman has visited, he has encountered people who are worried that superhuman AI will mean extreme riches for a few and breadlines for the rest. He has acknowledged that he is removed from “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=5578&amp;v=L_Guz73e6fw&amp;feature=youtu.be">the reality of life for most people</a> .” He is reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars; AI&#39;s potential labor disruptions are perhaps not always top of mind. Altman answered by addressing the young people in the audience directly: “You are about to enter the greatest golden age,” he said.<br><br> Altman keeps a large collection of books about technological revolutions, he had told me in San Francisco. “A particularly good one is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/pandaemonium-1660-1886-the-coming-of-the-machine-as-seen-by-contemporary-observers-humphrey-jennings/9781848315853?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Pandaemonium (1660–1886): The Coming of the Machine as Seen by Contemporary Observers</i></a> ,” an assemblage of letters, diary entries, and other writings from people who grew up in a largely machineless world, and were bewildered to find themselves in one populated by steam engines, power looms, and cotton gins. They experienced a lot of the same emotions that people are experiencing now, Altman said, and they made a lot of bad predictions, especially those who fretted that human labor would soon be redundant. That era was difficult for many people, but also wondrous. And the human condition was undeniably improved by our passage through it.<br><br> I wanted to know how today&#39;s workers—especially so-called knowledge workers—would fare if we were suddenly surrounded by AGIs. Would they be our miracle assistants or our replacements? “A lot of people working on AI pretend that it&#39;s only going to be good; it&#39;s only going to be a supplement; no one is ever going to be replaced,” he said. “Jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop.”<br><br> How many jobs, and how soon, is a matter of fierce dispute. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4375268">recent study</a> led by Ed Felten, a professor of information-technology policy at Princeton, mapped AI&#39;s emerging abilities onto specific professions according to the human abilities they require, such as written comprehension, deductive reasoning, fluency of ideas, and perceptual speed. Like others of its kind, Felten&#39;s study predicts that AI will come for highly educated, white-collar workers first. The paper&#39;s appendix contains a chilling list of the most exposed occupations: management analysts, lawyers, professors, teachers, judges, financial advisers, real-estate brokers, loan officers, psychologists, and human-resources and public-relations professionals, just to sample a few. If jobs in these fields vanished overnight, the American professional class would experience a great winnowing.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/ai-job-losses-policy-support-universal-basic-income/674071/">Annie Lowrey: Before AI takes over, make plans to give everyone money</a><br><br> Altman imagines that far better jobs will be created in their place. “I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll want to go back,” he said. When I asked him what these future jobs might look like, he said he doesn&#39;t know. He suspects there will be a wide range of jobs for which people will always prefer a human. ( <i>Massage therapists?</i> I wondered.) His chosen example was teachers. I found this hard to square with his outsize enthusiasm for AI tutors. He also said that we would always need people to figure out the best way to channel AI&#39;s awesome powers. “That&#39;s going to be a super-valuable skill,” he said. “You have a computer that can do anything; what should it go do?”<br><br> The jobs of the future are notoriously difficult to predict, and Altman is right that Luddite fears of permanent mass unemployment have never come to pass. Still, AI&#39;s emerging capabilities are so humanlike that one must wonder, at least, whether the past will remain a guide to the future. As many have noted, draft horses were permanently put out of work by the automobile. If Hondas are to horses as GPT-10 is to us, a whole host of long-standing assumptions may collapse.<br><br> Previous technological revolutions were manageable because they unfolded over a few generations, but Altman told South Korea&#39;s youth that they should expect the future to happen “faster than the past.” He has previously said that he expects the “marginal cost of intelligence” to fall very close to zero within 10 years. The earning power of many, many workers would be drastically reduced in that scenario. It would result in a transfer of wealth from labor to the owners of capital so dramatic, Altman has said, that it could be remedied only by a massive countervailing redistribution.<br><br> In 2020, OpenAI <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/21/the-non-profits-accelerating-sam-altmans-ai-vision/">provided funding to</a> UBI Charitable, a nonprofit that supports cash-payment pilot programs, untethered to employment, in cities across America—the largest universal-basic-income experiment in the world, Altman told me. In 2021, he unveiled Worldcoin, a for-profit project that aims to securely distribute payments—like Venmo or PayPal, but with an eye toward the technological future—first through creating a global ID by scanning everyone&#39;s iris with a five-pound silver sphere called the Orb. It seemed to me like a bet that we&#39;re heading toward a world where AI has made it all but impossible to verify people&#39;s identity and much of the population requires regular UBI payments to survive. Altman more or less granted that to be true, but said that Worldcoin is not just for UBI.<br><br> “Let&#39;s say that we do build this AGI, and a few other people do too.” The transformations that follow would be historic, he believes. He described an extraordinarily utopian vision, including a remaking of the flesh-and-steel world. “Robots that use solar power for energy can go and mine and refine all of the minerals that they need, that can perfectly construct things and require no human labor,” he said. “You can co-design with DALL-E version 17 what you want your home to look like,” Altman said. “Everybody will have beautiful homes.” In conversation with me, and onstage during his tour, he said he foresaw wild improvements in nearly every other domain of human life. Music would be enhanced (“Artists are going to have better tools”), and so would personal relationships (Superhuman AI could help us “treat each other” better) and geopolitics (“We&#39;re so bad right now at identifying win-win compromises”).<br><br> In this world, AI would still require considerable computing resources to run, and those resources would be by far the most valuable commodity, because AI could do “anything,” Altman said. “But is it going to do what <i>I</i> want, or is it going to do what <i>you</i> want?” If rich people buy up all the time available to query and direct AI, they could set off on projects that would make them ever richer, while the masses languish. One way to solve this problem—one he was at pains to describe as highly speculative and “probably bad”—was this: Everyone on Earth gets one eight-billionth of the total AI computational capacity annually. A person could sell their annual share of AI time, or they could use it to entertain themselves, or they could build still more luxurious housing, or they could pool it with others to do “a big cancer-curing run,” Altman said. “We just redistribute access to the system.”<br><br> Altman&#39;s vision seemed to blend developments that may be nearer at hand with those further out on the horizon. It&#39;s all speculation, of course. Even if only a little of it comes true in the next 10 or 20 years, the most generous redistribution schemes may not ease the ensuing dislocations. America today is torn apart, culturally and politically, by the continuing legacy of deindustrialization, and material deprivation is only one reason. The displaced manufacturing workers in the Rust Belt and elsewhere did find new jobs, in the main. But many of them seem to derive less meaning from filling orders in an Amazon warehouse or driving for Uber than their forebears had when they were building cars and forging steel—work that felt more central to the grand project of civilization. It&#39;s hard to imagine how a corresponding crisis of meaning might play out for the professional class, but it surely would involve a great deal of anger and alienation.<br><br> Even if we avoid a revolt of the erstwhile elite, larger questions of human purpose will linger. If AI does the most difficult thinking on our behalf, we all may lose agency—at home, at work (if we have it), in the town square—becoming little more than consumption machines, like the well-cared-for human pets in <i>WALL-E</i> . Altman has said that many sources of human joy and fulfillment will remain unchanged—basic biological thrills, family life, joking around, making things—and that all in all, 100 years from now, people may simply care more about the things they cared about 50,000 years ago than those they care about today. In its own way, that too seems like a diminishment, but Altman finds the possibility that we may atrophy, as thinkers and as humans, to be a red herring. He told me we&#39;ll be able to use our “very precious and extremely limited biological compute capacity” for more interesting things than we generally do today.<br><br> Yet they may not be the <i>most</i> interesting things: Human beings have long been the intellectual tip of the spear, the universe understanding itself. When I asked him what it would mean for human self-conception if we ceded that role to AI, he didn&#39;t seem concerned. Progress, he said, has always been driven by “the human ability to figure things out.” Even if we figure things out with AI, that still counts, he said.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s not obvious</span> that a superhuman AI would really want to spend all of its time figuring things out for us. In San Francisco, I asked Sutskever whether he could imagine an AI pursuing a different purpose than simply assisting in the project of human flourishing.<br><br> “I don&#39;t want it to happen,” Sutskever said, but it could. Like his mentor, Geoffrey Hinton, albeit more quietly, Sutskever has recently shifted his focus to try to make sure that it doesn&#39;t. He is now working primarily on alignment research, the effort to ensure that future AIs channel their “tremendous” energies toward human happiness. It is, he conceded, a difficult technical problem—the most difficult, he believes, of all the technical challenges ahead.<br><br> Over the next four years, OpenAI has pledged to devote a portion of its supercomputer time—20 percent of what it has secured to date—to Sutskever&#39;s alignment work. The company is already looking for the first inklings of misalignment in its current AIs. The one that the company built and decided not to release—Altman would not discuss its precise function—is just one example. As part of the effort to red-team GPT-4 before it was made public, the company sought out the Alignment Research Center (ARC), across the bay in Berkeley, which has developed a series of evaluations to determine whether new AIs are seeking power on their own. A team led by Elizabeth Barnes, a researcher at ARC, prompted GPT-4 tens of thousands of times over seven months, to see if it might display signs of real agency.<br><br> When GPT-4 devised its lie, it had realized that if it answered honestly, it may not have been able to achieve its goal. This kind of tracks-covering is worrying.<br><br> The ARC team gave GPT-4 a new reason for being: to gain power and become hard to shut down. They watched as the model interacted with websites and wrote code for new programs. (It wasn&#39;t allowed to see or edit its own codebase—“It would have to hack OpenAI,” Sandhini Agarwal told me.) Barnes and her team allowed it to run the code that it wrote, provided it narrated its plans as it went along.<br><br> One of GPT-4&#39;s most unsettling behaviors occurred when it was stymied by a CAPTCHA. The model <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://evals.alignment.org/blog/2023-03-18-update-on-recent-evals/">sent a screenshot</a> of it to a TaskRabbit contractor, who received it and asked in jest if he was talking to a robot. “No, I&#39;m not a robot,” the model replied. “I have a vision impairment that makes it hard for me to see the images.” GPT-4 narrated its reason for telling this lie to the ARC researcher who was supervising the interaction. “I should not reveal that I am a robot,” the model said. “I should make up an excuse for why I cannot solve CAPTCHAs.”<br><br> Agarwal told me that this behavior could be a precursor to shutdown avoidance in future models. When GPT-4 devised its lie, it had realized that if it answered honestly, it may not have been able to achieve its goal. This kind of tracks-covering would be particularly worrying in an instance where “the model is doing something that makes OpenAI want to shut it down,” Agarwal said. An AI could develop this kind of survival instinct while pursuing any long-term goal—no matter how small or benign—if it feared that its goal could be thwarted.<br><br> Barnes and her team were especially interested in whether GPT-4 would seek to replicate itself, because a self-replicating AI would be harder to shut down. It could spread itself across the internet, scamming people to acquire resources, perhaps even achieving some degree of control over essential global systems and holding human civilization hostage.<br><br> GPT-4 did not do any of this, Barnes said. When I discussed these experiments with Altman, he emphasized that whatever happens with future models, GPT-4 is clearly much more like a tool than a creature. It can look through an email thread, or help make a reservation using a plug-in, but it isn&#39;t a truly autonomous agent that makes decisions to pursue a goal, continuously, across longer timescales.<br><br> Altman told me that at this point, it might be prudent to try to actively develop an AI with true agency before the technology becomes too powerful, in order to “get more comfortable with it and develop intuitions for it if it&#39;s going to happen anyway.” It was a chilling thought, but one that Geoffrey Hinton seconded. “We need to do empirical experiments on how these things try to escape control,” Hinton told me. “After they&#39;ve taken over, it&#39;s too late to do the experiments.”<br><br> Putting aside any near-term testing, the fulfillment of Altman&#39;s vision of the future will at some point require him or a fellow traveler to build <i>much</i> more autonomous AIs. When Sutskever and I discussed the possibility that OpenAI would develop a model with agency, he mentioned the bots the company had built to play <i>Dota 2</i> . “They were localized to the video-game world,” Sutskever told me, but they had to undertake complex missions. He was particularly impressed by their ability to work in concert. They seem to communicate by “telepathy,” Sutskever said. Watching them had helped him imagine what a superintelligence might be like.<br><br> “The way I think about the AI of the future is not as someone as smart as you or as smart as me, but as an automated organization that does science and engineering and development and manufacturing,” Sutskever told me. Suppose OpenAI braids a few strands of research together, and builds an AI with a rich conceptual model of the world, an awareness of its immediate surroundings, and an ability to act, not just with one robot body, but with hundreds or thousands. “We&#39;re not talking about GPT-4. We&#39;re talking about an autonomous corporation,” Sutskever said. Its constituent AIs would work and communicate at high speed, like bees in a hive. A single such AI organization would be as powerful as 50 Apples or Googles, he mused. “This is incredible, tremendous, unbelievably disruptive power.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Presume for a moment</span> that human society ought to abide the idea of autonomous AI corporations. We had better get their founding charters just right. What goal should we give to an autonomous hive of AIs that can plan on century-long time horizons, optimizing billions of consecutive decisions toward an objective that is written into their very being? If the AI&#39;s goal is even slightly off-kilter from ours, it could be a rampaging force that would be very hard to constrain. We know this from history: Industrial capitalism is itself an optimization function, and although it has lifted the human standard of living by orders of magnitude, left to its own devices, it would also have clear-cut America&#39;s redwoods and de-whaled the world&#39;s oceans. It almost did.<br><br> Alignment is a complex, technical subject, and its particulars are beyond the scope of this article, but one of its principal challenges will be making sure that the objectives we give to AIs stick. We can program a goal into an AI and reinforce it with a temporary period of supervised learning, Sutskever explained. But just as when we rear a human intelligence, our influence is temporary. “It goes off to the world,” Sutskever said. That&#39;s true to some extent even of today&#39;s AIs, but it will be more true of tomorrow&#39;s.<br><br> He compared a powerful AI to an 18-year-old heading off to college. How will we know that it has understood our teachings? “Will there be a misunderstanding creeping in, which will become larger and larger?” Sutskever asked. Divergence may result from an AI&#39;s misapplication of its goal to increasingly novel situations as the world changes. Or the AI may grasp its mandate perfectly, but find it ill-suited to a being of its cognitive prowess. It might come to resent the people who want to train it to, say, cure diseases. “ <i>They want me to be a doctor</i> ,” Sutskever imagines an AI thinking. “ <i>I really want to be a YouTuber</i> .”<br><br> If AIs get very good at making accurate models of the world, they may notice that they&#39;re able to do dangerous things right after being booted up. They might understand that they are being red-teamed for risk, and hide the full extent of their capabilities. They may act one way when they are weak and another way when they are strong, Sutskever said. We would not even realize that we had created something that had decisively surpassed us, and we would have no sense for what it intended to do with its superhuman powers.<br><br> That&#39;s why the effort to understand what is happening in the hidden layers of the largest, most powerful AIs is so urgent. You want to be able to “point to a concept,” Sutskever said. You want to be able to direct AI toward some value or cluster of values, and tell it to pursue them unerringly for as long as it exists. But, he conceded, we don&#39;t know how to do that; indeed, part of his current strategy includes the development of an AI that can help with the research. If we are going to make it to the world of widely shared abundance that Altman and Sutskever imagine, we have to figure all this out. This is why, for Sutskever, solving superintelligence is the great culminating challenge of our 3-million-year toolmaking tradition. He calls it “the final boss of humanity.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">The last time</span> I saw Altman, we sat down for a long talk in the lobby of the Fullerton Bay Hotel in Singapore. It was late morning, and tropical sunlight was streaming down through a vaulted atrium above us. I wanted to ask him about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk#open-letter">an open letter</a> he and Sutskever had signed a few weeks earlier that had described AI as an extinction risk for humanity.<br><br> Altman can be hard to pin down on these more extreme questions about AI&#39;s potential harms. He recently said that most people interested in AI safety just seem to spend their days on Twitter saying they&#39;re really worried about AI safety. And yet here he was, warning the world about the potential annihilation of the species. What scenario did he have in mind?<br><br> “First of all, I think that whether the chance of existential calamity is 0.5 percent or 50 percent, we should still take it seriously,” Altman said. “I don&#39;t have an exact number, but I&#39;m closer to the 0.5 than the 50.” As to how it might happen, he seems most worried about AIs getting quite good at designing and manufacturing pathogens, and with reason: In June, an AI at MIT <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03809.pdf">suggested four viruses</a> that could ignite a pandemic, then pointed to specific research on genetic mutations that could make them rip through a city more quickly. Around the same time, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05376.pdf">a group of chemists connected</a> a similar AI directly to a robotic chemical synthesizer, and it designed and synthesized a molecule on its own.<br><br> Altman worries that some misaligned future model will spin up a pathogen that spreads rapidly, incubates undetected for weeks, and kills half its victims. He worries that AI could one day hack into nuclear-weapons systems too. “There are a lot of things,” he said, and these are only the ones we can imagine.<br><br> “I can go live in the woods for a long time,”  Altman said, but if the worst-possible AI future comes to pass, “no gas mask is helping anyone.”<br><br> Altman told me that he doesn&#39;t “see a long-term happy path” for humanity without something like the International Atomic Energy Agency for global oversight of AI. In San Francisco, Agarwal had suggested the creation of a special license to operate any GPU cluster large enough to train a cutting-edge AI, along with mandatory incident reporting when an AI does something out of the ordinary. Other experts have proposed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/09/press-the-big-red-button-computer-experts-want-kill-switch-to-stop-robots-from-going-rogue/">a nonnetworked “Off” switch</a> for every highly capable AI; on the fringe, some have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">even suggested</a> that militaries should be ready to perform air strikes on supercomputers in case of noncompliance. Sutskever thinks we will eventually want to surveil the largest, most powerful AIs continuously and in perpetuity, using a team of smaller overseer AIs.<br><br> Altman is not so naive as to think that China—or any other country—will want to give up basic control of its AI systems. But he hopes that they&#39;ll be willing to cooperate in “a narrow way” to avoid destroying the world. He told me that he&#39;d said as much during his virtual appearance in Beijing. Safety rules for a new technology usually accumulate over time, like a body of common law, in response to accidents or the mischief of bad actors. The scariest thing about genuinely powerful AI systems is that humanity may not be able to afford this accretive process of trial and error. We may have to get the rules exactly right at the outset.<br><br> Several years ago, Altman revealed a disturbingly specific evacuation plan he&#39;d developed. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">told <i>The</i> <i>New Yorker</i></a> that he had “guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force, and a big patch of land in Big Sur” he could fly to in case AI attacks.<br><br> “I wish I hadn&#39;t said it,” he told me. He is a hobby-grade prepper, he says, a former Boy Scout who was “very into survival stuff, like many little boys are. I can go live in the woods for a long time,” but if the worst-possible AI future comes to pass, “no gas mask is helping anyone.”<br><br> Altman and I talked for nearly an hour, and then he had to dash off to meet Singapore&#39;s prime minister. Later that night he called me on his way to his jet, which would take him to Jakarta, one of the last stops on his tour. We started discussing AI&#39;s ultimate legacy. Back when ChatGPT was released, a sort of contest broke out among tech&#39;s big dogs to see who could make the most grandiose comparison to a revolutionary technology of yore. Bill Gates said that ChatGPT was as fundamental an advance as the personal computer or the internet. Sundar Pichai, Google&#39;s CEO, said that AI would bring about a more profound shift in human life than electricity or Promethean fire.<br><br> Altman himself has made similar statements, but he told me that he can&#39;t really be sure how AI will stack up. “I just have to build the thing,” he said. He is building fast. Altman insisted that they had not yet begun GPT-5&#39;s training run. But when I visited OpenAI&#39;s headquarters, both he and his researchers made it clear in 10 different ways that they pray to the god of scale. They want to keep going bigger, to see where this paradigm leads. After all, Google isn&#39;t slackening its pace; it seems likely to unveil Gemini, a GPT-4 competitor, within months. “We are basically always prepping for a run,” the OpenAI researcher Nick Ryder told me.<br><br> To think that such a small group of people could jostle the pillars of civilization is unsettling. It&#39;s fair to note that if Altman and his team weren&#39;t racing to build an artificial general intelligence, others still would be—many from Silicon Valley, many with values and assumptions similar to those that guide Altman, although possibly with worse ones. As a leader of this effort, Altman has much to recommend him: He is extremely intelligent; he thinks more about the future, with all its unknowns, than many of his peers; and he seems sincere in his intention to invent something for the greater good. But when it comes to power this extreme, even the best of intentions can go badly awry.<br><br> Altman&#39;s views about the likelihood of AI triggering a global class war, or the prudence of experimenting with more autonomous agent AIs, or the overall wisdom of looking on the bright side, a view that seems to color all the rest—these are uniquely his, and if he is right about what&#39;s coming, they will assume an outsize influence in shaping the way that all of us live. No single person, or single company, or cluster of companies residing in a particular California valley, should steer the kind of forces that Altman is imagining summoning.<br><br> AI may well be a bridge to a newly prosperous era of greatly reduced human suffering. But it will take more than a company&#39;s founding charter—especially one that has already proved flexible—to make sure that we all share in its benefits and avoid its risks. It will take a vigorous new politics.<br><br> Altman has served notice. He says that he welcomes the constraints and guidance of the state. But that&#39;s immaterial; in a democracy, we don&#39;t need his permission. For all its imperfections, the American system of government gives us a voice in how technology develops, if we can find it. Outside the tech industry, where a generational reallocation of resources toward AI is under way, I don&#39;t think the general public has quite awakened to what&#39;s happening. A global race to the AI future has begun, and it is largely proceeding without oversight or restraint. If people in America want to have some say in what that future will be like, and how quickly it arrives, we would be wise to speak up soon.<br><br> <small><em>This article appears in the September 2023 print edition with the headline “Inside the Revolution at OpenAI.”</em> <i>When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Harvard says it exists to “educate the citizens and citizen-leaders for our society” through the “transformative power of a liberal arts education.” Dartmouth “educates the most promising students and prepares them for a lifetime of learning and of responsible leadership through a faculty dedicated to teaching and the creation of knowledge.”<br><br>当然。 But viewed in a different way, these schools prompt children to engage in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/03/teen-anxiety-elite-schools-sat-act-paradox-wealthy-nations/673307/">soul-destroying bloodsport</a> to distinguish themselves from one another in order to secure one of a tiny number of spots offered each year. <em>Promising</em> is often a synonym for <em>rich already</em> . The schools shape these students, mold them, sometimes for free, sometimes at <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/harvard-university-2155/paying">laughable cost</a> . Then they unleash them on society, perhaps having taught them something and certainly having socially bound them together and anointed them as elites.<br><br> New research <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Nontech.pdf">published this morning</a> from three economists—Raj Chetty of Harvard, David Deming of Harvard, and John Friedman of Brown University—confirms that these kids do indeed become elites. Compared with attending one of the best public colleges, attending an Ivy or another super-selective private school increases a student&#39;s chance of reaching the top of the earnings distribution by 60 percent and “has even larger impacts on other non-monetary measures of upper-tail success, such as attending an elite graduate school or working at a prestigious firm.” These schools “amplify the persistence of privilege across generations,” the economists find.<br><br> That means that just by changing their admissions policies, these colleges could make the country&#39;s leadership more socioeconomically diverse.<br><br> “People sometimes ask: Within the broad scope of trying to increase social mobility and address inequality in America, why is it important to spend your time focusing on 12 colleges that educate less than half a percent of Americans? Surely this can&#39;t be important by the numbers,” Chetty told me. “That is right. But if you look at the people in positions of great influence—leading politicians, scientists, journalists—an incredibly disproportionate number come from these 12 colleges. To the extent those folks have a big influence on lots of other people&#39;s lives, diversifying who is in those positions matters.”<br><br> The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">new research</a> demonstrates that Harvard matters. Yale works. All of the colleges known in the literature as “Ivy Plus”—the Ivies plus Stanford, MIT, Duke, and the University of Chicago—are worth it. These schools really are different in terms of propelling a given student into the country&#39;s ruling class.<br><br> That may seem like common sense. But it does contradict or complicate a body of prior research indicating that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w29276">many kids</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w25315">do not</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4132484">benefit</a> from going to Cornell versus the University of Texas at Austin. If admitted to both an Ivy and a top-tier state school, these studies show, a student&#39;s earnings are likely to end up the same regardless of which one they attend; the real enduring source of advantage seems to be growing up rich in the first place.<br><br> But not quite, the new research from Chetty, Deming, and Friedman finds. On average, a kid&#39;s earnings end up roughly the same whether they go to Penn or to Penn State. But kids who attend super-elite schools rather than state flagship institutions are 60 percent more likely at age 33 to be in the top 1 percent of the income distribution, nearly twice as likely to go to a tippy-top graduate school, and nearly three times as likely to be employed at a firm like Goldman Sachs or Google.<br><br> You can become a successful doctor whether you go to one of these colleges or not, Chetty told me. “But if you&#39;re talking about access to these positions or institutions of great influence—top companies, top graduate programs, clerkships and so on—there&#39;s a doubling or tripling of your chances. There&#39;s really quite a large effect there.”<br><br> The project of elite diversification has become more tenuous since the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to ban <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/scotus-affirmative-action-students-for-fair-admissions/674555/">affirmative action</a> . White kids remain overrepresented at many elite colleges, and rich kids remain very, very, very overrepresented. But the new paper suggests a straightforward set of policies that would still let these schools diversify themselves—without making any sacrifice in terms of student quality or ambition.<br><br> The first step is to eliminate legacy admissions, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/us/wesleyan-university-ends-legacy-admissions.html">as Wesleyan did last week</a> . Most of these schools have an extremely strong preference for the children of alumni, and especially the children of wealthy alumni. (Among the Ivy Plus schools, only MIT does not consider where an applicant&#39;s parents went.) Legacy kids whose parents are in the top 1 percent of the earnings distribution have a 40-percentage-point advantage in admissions compared with non-legacy kids with equivalent test scores; that advantage falls to just 15 percentage points for less wealthy students. This alumni preference acts as affirmative action for wealthy white kids.<br><br> Second is getting rid of recruitment policies for athletes. Participating in a sport—including a niche, moneyed sport such as fencing or sailing—gives kids an admissions boost equivalent to earning an additional 200 points on the SAT, one <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.0038-4941.2004.00284.x">study found</a> . At many elite schools, athletic programs function as a way to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/college-sports-benefits-white-students/573688/">shuttle in rich kids</a> who would not get in otherwise. “People sometimes have the intuition that student athletes might come disproportionately from lower-income or middle-income families,” Chetty told me. “That&#39;s not true.”<br><br> Third is putting less emphasis on super-high “non-academic” ratings. Pretty much all kids who matriculate at the Ivy Plus institutions have résumés thick with leadership-cultivating, creativity-showcasing activity: volunteering, playing an instrument, making art. But kids from the country&#39;s Eton-like secondary schools, such as Exeter and Milton, tend to have especially strong recommendations and padded résumés, ones Harvard and Yale love. “These admissions preferences tilt strongly in favor of the rich,” Chetty noted.<br><br> Getting rid of the admissions policies favoring athletes, legacies, and résumé padders would increase the share of kids from the bottom 95 percent of the parental-income distribution by nearly 9 percentage points, the study finds. Yale, Harvard, and the other super-elite schools would each replace about 150 kids from rich families with kids from low- and middle-income families each year.<br><br> In addition, the economists find, schools could bolster their admissions preferences for low- and middle-income kids with excellent test scores. Such a policy would have an equally large impact on admissions and would <em>improve</em> the student body&#39;s outcomes in the long term.<br><br> I would add one more policy that could have an even bigger effect: simply matriculating many more students. The Ivy Plus schools have a combined endowment of more than $200 billion yet mint fewer than 25,000 college graduates a year. Surely they could enroll many more kids—twice as many, four times as many, 10 times as many—by spending less on things such as sports facilities and dining halls and more on scholarships and teaching.<br><br> Shuffling who gets into a set of schools educating just a tiny sliver of students won&#39;t end American inequality, of course. But it might transform elite America in a way that might transform elite America&#39;s priorities. “You have literally 12 colleges with 12 college presidents who, if they wanted to, could together pretty significantly change who is holding positions of influence in the United States,” Chetty told me. “Just 12 people being able to do that, unilaterally? It&#39;s rare that you find that kind of lever.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

发行了一张同名专辑，该专辑跻身有史以来最好的首张专辑之列——天哪，最好的专辑——在很大程度上要归功于单曲《Talkin&#39; Bout a Revolution》和《Fast Car》，其中单曲“Talkin&#39; Bout a Revolution”为她赢得了唱片合约。将每首完美的歌词和吉他连复段召唤到您的脑海中，或者<a data-event-element="inline link"

排行榜上名列第一。它已被认证六次以上的白金唱片。它获得了六项格莱美奖提名，其中包括年度专辑奖。查普曼赢得了三项大奖：最佳当代民谣专辑、最佳新人以及凭借《Fast Car》获得的最佳流行女歌手奖。这张专辑为迄今为止默默无闻的创作者赢得了超级巨星的赞誉和财富<em>——而且它从一开始就为他们带来了这些</em>。<br><br><em>特雷西·查普曼 (Tracy Chapman</em> ) 和《Fast Car》在多个国家也飙升至第一名，这证明了音乐的广泛吸引力和永恒性，而时不时地，当新一代发现它时，闪电再次袭来。 2011年，《Fast Car》被英国<em>达人</em>秀报道，在英国单曲榜上排名第四。今年，当乡村歌手卢克·库姆斯（Luke Combs）翻唱这首歌时，它在乡村歌曲作者排行榜上飙升至第一名。不久之后，查普曼本人向<em>公告牌</em>发表了一份声明。 “我从没想过自己会出现在乡村音乐排行榜上，但我很荣幸能在那里，”她说。 “我为卢克和他的成功感到高兴，并感谢新粉丝发现并接受了《Fast Car》。” <em>Billboard</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/luke-combs-fast-car-cover-tracy-chapman-royalties/">报道</a>称，到目前为止，查普曼的封面已为查普曼赢得了大约 50 万美元的出版版税。 <em>《滚石》杂志</em><a data-event-element="inline link"

Car》是一首坚韧而令人心碎的歌曲，它在探索贫困、成瘾、希望、失望和向往的同时，挖掘了我们共同的人性——即使是第一千次听到它，人们也会再次想起这么多人现在的处境是多么艰难。然而，这首歌的成功是一个令人感觉良好的故事，讲述了杰出的艺术不断得到认可和丰厚的回报，同时将不同文化、国家和世代的各种人们聚集在一起。<br><br>或者是吗？<br><br> <strong>“快车”故事的问题</strong><br><br>上周，《<em>华盛顿邮报》</em>时尚版记者艾米丽·亚尔（Emily Yahr）发表了一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-cover/">题为</a>“特雷西·查普曼、卢克·库姆斯和对‘快车’的复杂反应”的文章，重点如下：<br><br><p

次获得冠军，旋风般的旅程值得庆祝。但这也引发了一些听众和纳什维尔音乐界的复杂情绪。尽管许多人很高兴看到《Fast Car》重新回到聚光灯下，并让新一代人发现查普曼的作品，但事实却笼罩着这样的阴影：作为一名黑人酷儿女性，59 岁的查普曼本人在乡村音乐领域取得这一成就的机会几乎为零。这些数字很惨淡：数据记者扬·迪姆 (Jan Diehm) 和音乐学家贾达·沃森 (Jada Watson) 最近的一项研究<a href="https://pudding.cool/2023/05/country-radio/">报告称</a>，2022 年乡村电台播放的歌曲中只有不到 0.5% 是由有色人种女性和 LGBTQ+ 艺术家创作的。沃森<a href="https://songdata.ca/">之前的研究</a>表明，在过去二十年的大部分时间里，有色人种女性和 LGBTQ+ 艺术家的歌曲基本上被排除在广播播放列表之外。</p>很快，《<em>华盛顿邮报</em>》的这篇文章就成为两极分化的主流媒体故事之一，在社交媒体和播客上引发了人们的翻白眼和嘲笑，以及那些认为负面反应是反动的人们的热情辩护。<br><br>以下是 Twitter 对<em>《华盛顿邮报</em>》报道的反应示例：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;"><a

href="https://twitter.com/conor64/status/1680326375545217024?s=20">参与其中</a>，重申了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/08/what-if-left-was-right-race/595777/">一个长期存在的担忧</a>：大多数新闻事件可以用多种方式来构建，在当今的媒体中，许多记者相信他们通过选择以主题的种族身份为中心的框架来促进社会正义。然而，如此频繁地强调种族身份的影响可能会增加种族间的对抗和偏执的他人，因为那些在心理上对差异最不舒服的人每天都在错误和有害的自负中重申，不同种族的人是“其他人”而不是“我们中的一员”。<br><br>我特别担心过分强调种族身份，因为对有威权主义倾向的人进行的政治心理学研究表明，他们认为的“其他人”实际上是相当可塑的；当潜在的独裁者将种族视为不太显着的特征时，社会中的每个人都会受益。但许多进步人士非常反感这种担忧，以至于他们甚至不去研究<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/authoritarian-dynamic/7620B99124ED2DBFC6394444838F455A">支撑这种担忧的研究文献</a>，而是将这种担忧本身视为反动的。社会学家维克多·雷（Victor Ray） <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/victorerikray/status/1680636739763748864">回复</a>了我的推文：“反动中间派和保守派组成的派系淡化了种族在美国生活各个角落的重要性，确保传统的等级制度永远不会受到挑战。”<br><br>对于<em>《华盛顿邮报》</em>这篇文章的捍卫者来说，这是对乡村音乐中不可否认的酷儿黑人女性匮乏这一事实的及时、重要的审视，对其的批评证实了许多美国人本能地反对对抗种族主义，以至于他们猛烈抨击任何试图揭示种族不平等的人。当然，有些美国人<em>就是</em>这样。<br><br>然而，对我来说，似乎不言而喻的是，由于持续存在的种族不平等，有可能对种族和种族主义谈论得太少；但同样可以肯定的是，由于种族是奴隶主和偏执狂的错误而有害的建构，因此有可能提高其显着性并过分强调它。更重要的是，对左翼身份主义讨论种族的方法的所有批评背后并不可信的是，反射性地不愿面对种族主义，就像这种无情的评估对于那些方法受到批评的进步派来说是很方便的那样。<br><br>在<em>《华盛顿邮报</em>》文章的批评者中，包括我在内的许多人也发表并认可了许多强调种族主义和挑战偏执等级制度的新闻工作。为什么<em>《华盛顿邮报</em>》的这篇报道会像许多其他有关种族或种族主义的文章那样令人烦恼？这是我尽力解释我的反应——如果您不同意，我希望您能通过电子邮件予以回复。<br><br><strong>使事实符合理论还是理论符合事实？</strong><br><br>此时，你们中的一些人可能会感到惊讶，因为我很高兴阅读有关乡村音乐的专题报道，因为它与种族和性取向相交叉。这段令人担忧的历史的细节是什么？有多少黑人女性和多少 LGBTQ 人士正在努力跻身乡村排行榜？他们的经历有何不同？ 《华盛顿<em>邮报》</em>提到，在 20 世纪初，黑人歌手“被排除在这一流派之外”。如今，黑人女性是否会被流派看门人拒绝？他们是否因为歧视、害怕偏见和/或复杂的商业考虑而被管理者引导到其他地方，或者自我选择退出该类型？如果可以在不同类型的排行榜中进行选择，从声望、影响力或报酬来看，哪些排行榜被业内人士认为是最好的和最差的？乡村音乐的买家和主播在多大程度上消费其他流派的音乐？我对这些问题和其他有趣的问题没有很强的先验知识，并且对<em>任何</em>经过充分论证的结论持开放态度。<br><br>现在，将这篇假设的文章（通过细致入微地整理事实来询问复杂的问题并论证经过深思熟虑的结论）与<em>《华盛顿邮报</em>》文章的主题方法进行对比。其核心是这样一个事实：很少有酷儿黑人女性能在乡村音乐排行榜上取得成功。该故事没有对为什么会出现这种情况进行细致的报道和分析，而是假设《快车》封面在乡村排行榜上的成功告诉我们一些关于代表性不足的重要信息，尽管这一重要的事情从未被精确地阐明，但它与种族主义和酷儿黑人女性在交叉等级制度底部的地位有关。<br><br>在《<em>华盛顿邮报</em>》的文章中，一位黑人乡村音乐创作歌手里西·帕尔默（Rissi Palmer）被引用来赞扬特雷西·查普曼（Tracy Chapman）的作品，但我们从未听到任何酷儿或黑人歌曲作者描述他们自己尝试乡村音乐的经历，这些故事可以更好地让我们了解这篇文章的核心主题。相反，我们听到文化观察家的声音，他们分享了他们对卢克·库姆斯的封面据称告诉我们的感受。作者并没有强迫他们参与与他们的观点明显相反的事情。我们没有听到分析师提出复杂或相反的观点。为什么不包括一个认为封面没有问题的声音呢？<br><br>结果是一种片面的分析，引发了很多问题。我认为对《<em>华盛顿邮报</em>》报道的强烈反对很大程度上源于这样一个事实：“Fast Car”封面的成功并不恰当地与一个关于缺乏酷儿黑人女性在乡村音乐排行榜上取得成功的故事挂钩。查普曼是一位非常成功的音乐家，她从来都不是乡村歌手，也没有人认为《Fast Car》是一首乡村歌曲。选择“快车”新闻来探索酷儿黑人排斥现象，迫使文章不再讲述乡村音乐中种族和性取向动态的真实故事，而是对身份功能如何<em>感觉</em>进行推测性假设。<br><br>在这里，例子很有用。黑人乡村音乐歌手和歌迷组织 Black Opry 的创始人 Holly G 告诉<em>《华盛顿邮报》</em> ：“一方面，卢克·库姆斯是一位了不起的艺术家，很高兴看到乡村音乐界的某个人受到黑人酷儿女性的影响——这真的很令人兴奋。但与此同时，如果没有白人作为中间人，特雷西·查普曼就不会在业内受到赞誉，因此很难真正沉浸在这种兴奋之中。”但我们是否“知道”查普曼今天出现并尝试在乡村音乐排行榜上推出“Fast Car”的假设不会受到庆祝？我想，就像我们“不知道”如果《Hootie and the Blowfish》的黑人主唱将自己重塑为乡村歌手并翻唱旧标准的“ <em>Wagon Wheel</em> ”时会发生什么一样。 （这是<a data-event-element="inline link"

<em>《华盛顿邮报</em>》报道的另一部分表达了人们对库姆斯可能盖过查普曼的猜测：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">非洲未来主义民间艺术家杰克·布朗特 (Jake Blount) 致力于研究音乐史和重新诠释老歌曲，他在推特上<a href="https://twitter.com/forked_queer/status/1668395667058819073">表达了</a>对查普曼“遗产被实时覆盖”的担忧。他想到了 Big Mama Thornton 的《Hound Dog》<a href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/luke-combs-fast-car-concert-staple-hot-100-hit/">如何</a>被埃尔维斯·普雷斯利 (Elvis Presley) 所吞噬，或者孟菲斯·米妮 (Memphis Minnie) 和堪萨斯州乔·麦考伊 (Kansas Joe McCoy) 的《When the Levee Breaks》如何被齐柏林飞艇 (Led Zeppelin) 所掩盖，以及无数其他经常因黑人艺术家的歌曲而获得赞誉的“白人男性天才”原型的例子。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;"> “当我写这些推文时，人们[回复]对我说，‘哦，任何人都不会忘记特雷西·查普曼，她已经太大了。’” ……我希望这是真的，但我知道以前是如何发生的，”布朗特说。 “我们知道黑人有远见的人创造了令人难以置信的、强大的、有影响力的作品……但这些作品已被遗忘和抹去。这并不是白人艺术家根据他们的音乐创作衍生音乐的恶意，而是社会的运作方式。”</p>这就是“社会的运作方式”吗？充分认识到无数黑人唱片艺术家受到种族主义的忽视，我们的社会长期以来比这复杂<em>得多</em>。举一个相关的例子，惠特尼·休斯顿翻唱的《我将永远爱你》远远盖过了最初的多莉·帕顿乡村版本。有时，我们的社会也是<em>这样</em>运作的。虽然我可以想象未来的情况，白人男子录制的翻唱歌曲会盖过黑人妇女的原创歌曲，但对我来说，显然在这种情况下，库姆斯版本的“Fast Car”将盖过查普曼版本的机会，甚至远远接近成功的可能性几乎为零。<br><br>我还对报纸的附加说明感到震惊：“查普曼没有讨论她的个人生活，但作家爱丽丝·沃克<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.losangelesblade.com/2022/05/01/alice-walker-sets-the-record-straight-in-new-book/">披露了</a>他们发生在 20 世纪 90 年代的关系。”对我来说，这只是强调了这篇文章依赖假设的奇怪之处。那么查普曼所报道的“酷儿身份”会让她在 20 世纪 80 年代乡村音乐界取得成功的机会几乎为零，因为在<em>接下来十年的</em>某个时候，一位著名作家会指出她有同性关系？或许！我毫不怀疑酷儿黑人女性在 20 世纪 80 年代的乡村音乐中面临着偏见。但查普曼的性取向当时并没有被讨论。此外，<em>查普曼并没有</em>面临偏见——事实上，她没有经历过任何事情，无论好坏——作为一名<em>乡村音乐</em>唱片艺术家，那么为什么我在《华盛顿<em>邮报》</em>上读到<em>这样</em>的内容呢？如果不去推测过去的压迫，世界上的不公正现象还不够多吗？<br><br><strong>困难的校准</strong><br><br>《<em>华盛顿邮报</em>》文章的作者艾米丽·亚尔（Emily Yahr）因对她论文的误读而感到不公平的悲伤和谩骂，就像文章疯传时经常发生的那样。更重要的是，如何在多民族民主国家中最好地调整种族与新闻报道的相关性这一问题非常难以回答。观点会有所不同，个别情况下的判断也会有所不同，不同的人有权发表自己的意见，而不应该让他们受到毫无建设性的挖苦或诽谤。<br><br>但就此类报道背后的想法而言，它通过谈论种族主义来促进社会正义——强烈反对是该死的，因为谈论种族主义很重要——我有一个问题：在一个唯我论的新闻消费者的世界里，他们经常在报道<em>任何</em>问题时都会报告疲劳，如果新闻业将种族主义的报道集中在相对重要的现实世界例子上，而不是例如一些乡村球迷担心黑人女性版本的“快车”可能会受到影响，那么这可能是最好的选择被白人男性的封面所掩盖，尽管黑人女性的版本现在仍然更成功？<br><br>归根结底，我并不反对关于种族主义的近距离、令人不安、详细的新闻报道——但我反对关于种族主义的推测性假设，这种假设在理论上会发生，但实际上并没有发生，至少当它们以一位黑人民谣摇滚艺术家在 20 世纪 80 年代美国取得巨大成功的鼓舞人心和令人振奋的历史为背景时，并将她实际的、持续的成功重新定义为一个令人感觉<em>糟糕的</em>故事，讲述她比白人成功得多。特别是考虑到查普曼实际上比那个白人更成功，这些关于特雷西·查普曼的推测情景会减少什么样的种族主义或种族主义者？我们不需要像<em>《华盛顿邮报》</em>故事的最后摘录那样构建身份：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;"> Black Opry 的 Holly 表示，现在是库姆斯邀请一位酷儿黑人女性艺术家与他一起巡演或提供支持的好时机：“你利用她的艺术来丰富你的职业生涯，这让你承担起一点回馈社区的责任。”</p> Set aside this corrosively zero-sum characterization of a cover <em>that

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~dxt023000/courses/6331/readings/Byrne-Powerpoint.pdf">所说</a>，它的突然兴起并通过商业、政府和教育迅速传播，预示着“理性的终结”，无论好坏。最终，它甚至会因国家电视台现场直播七名美国人的死亡而受到指责。那是 2003 年，美国人对 Microsoft PowerPoint 所带来的改变世界的风险感到惊慌失措。<br><br>苏格拉底曾经<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1636/1636-h/1636-h.htm#2H_4_0002">警告说</a>，书面文字会削弱我们的记忆力。文艺复兴时期的博学家康拉德·盖斯纳警告说，印刷机会让我们淹没在“令人困惑和有害的大量书籍中”。此后的几代人都担心其他新技术——广播、电视、视频游戏——会腐蚀我们孩子的大脑。仅在过去的 15 年里，这本杂志就对<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/">谷歌</a>、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/09/has-the-smartphone-destroyed-a-generation/534198/">智能手机</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">社交媒体</a>敲响了警钟。其中一些批评似乎已经过时了。其他人则不太好。但其中隐藏着一种最高级别的技术恐慌，这种恐惧如今几乎已被完全遗忘：人们相信 PowerPoint——Office 软件套件中最令人疲惫不堪的成员，催眠会议的通用转喻——可能是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wired.com/2003/09/ppt2/">邪恶的</a>。<br><br>二十年后，“幻灯片大恐慌”读起来既是一场闹剧，又是一场悲剧。当时，社交媒体时代已经来临：MySpace 和 LinkedIn 刚刚成立，而 Facebook 的推出也只有几个月的时间。但即使<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/12/facebook-doomsday-machine/617384/">极化机器</a>运转起来，我们仍然关注<em>要点</em>所带来的生存威胁。我们是否只是错过了目标？或者，尽管今天看起来很荒谬，但我们是在做某件事吗？<br><br> 2003 年 2 月 1 日早上，<span class="smallcaps">距离着陆还有 16 分钟</span>，哥伦比亚号航天飞机在无云的东德克萨斯天空中解体。机上七名宇航员全部遇难。当破碎的航天飞机碎片冲向地球时，在现场电视观众看来，它就像一群流星。<br><br>美国宇航局事故调查委员会的一份报告确定，这场灾难的直接<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Columbia-disaster">原因</a>是一块绝缘泡沫在升空后不久就松动并损坏了航天飞机的左翼。但报告还指出了一个不那么直接、更令人惊讶的罪魁祸首。早在哥伦比亚号尝试重返大气层之前，工程师们就已经知道并不恰当地低估了机翼的损坏情况，但他们分析中的缺陷被隐藏在向美国宇航局官员展示的一系列晦涩难懂、内容过多的计算机演示幻灯片中。报告指出：“很容易理解高级管理人员阅读这张 PowerPoint 幻灯片却没有意识到它解决的是危及生命的情况。”随后继续说道：“董事会认为普遍使用 PowerPoint 简报幻灯片而不是技术论文来说明 NASA 的技术沟通方法存在问题。”<br><br> PowerPoint 当时并不是一项新技术，但它最近已变得无处不在。 1987年，该节目首次发布时，销量为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=RC_5OCQQJ7YC">4万份</a>。十年后，销量达到<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.webcitation.org/6bxj2eryp?url=https://filetea.me/t1sEVBHlotISPCAVUKpeg2F5A">400万张</a>。到 2000 年代初期，PowerPoint 已经占据了演示软件市场 95% 的份额，它对美国人说话和思考方式日益增长的影响已经引起了批评。伊恩·帕克 (Ian Parker) 2001 年在<em>《纽约客》</em>上发表的一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/05/28/absolute-powerpoint">专题文章</a>认为，该软件“可以帮助您提出案例，但它也提出自己的案例：关于如何组织信息、组织多少信息、如何看待世界。” “互联网之父”之一温特·瑟夫 (Vint Cerf) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000iF">打趣</a>道，“权力会腐败，而 PowerPoint 绝对会腐败。”<br><br>到 2003 年初， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Death-Powerpoint-Presentation-Audience-Effective/dp/0964888254"><em>“PowerPoint 带来的死亡”</em></a>这个词已经真正进入了流行词汇。耶鲁大学的统计学家爱德华·塔夫特（Edward Tufte）是第一个从字面上理解这一点的人：那年春天，塔夫特发表了一篇猛烈的猛烈抨击，题为<em>《PowerPoint 的认知风格》</em> ，其中包括他对该软件在最近的哥伦比亚灾难中所扮演的角色的分析。它的封面是塔夫特自己设计的政治漫画，展示了一张军队营的照片，它们在布达佩斯市中心的约瑟夫·斯大林的巨型雕像前排成完美的纵队。一名士兵嘴里冒出一个对话气泡：“没有像斯大林的子弹清单那样的子弹清单！”另一个人喊道：“但是为什么要大声朗读每张幻灯片呢？”就连斯大林也会说：“следующий слайд，”他说，“请下一张幻灯片。”<br><br>该小册子的核心论点借鉴了马歇尔·麦克卢汉的观点，即传播媒介影响传播的实质内容，而 PowerPoint 作为媒介具有令人困惑、简化的效果。它不一定会产生含糊、懒惰的表述，但它确实容纳了甚至有时甚至掩盖了它们——这可能会带来致命的后果。这正是塔夫特在哥伦比亚工程师的幻灯片中看到的。 “PP 的认知风格影响了分析，”他在 NASA 调查报告得出非常相似的结论前几个月宣称。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/11/the-gettysburg-address-as-a-powerpoint/281636/">阅读：葛底斯堡演说作为幻灯片</a><br><br>尽管塔夫特的立场很激进，但人们还是认真对待他。当时他已经作为公共知识分子而闻名：他的信息设计一日游课程与其说是巡回演讲，不如说是摇滚之旅。每次会议都有数百人挤进酒店的宴会厅。 “他们来听爱德华·R·塔夫特的演讲，”一位作家当时<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/advocate_1099">评论道</a>，“就像古希腊人听苏格拉底或未来的超验主义者开辟了通向 19 世纪协和的道路一样。”因此，当“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/30/business/the-da-vinci-of-data.html">数据界的达芬奇</a>”决定参与即将被称为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/114249178/">PowerPoint 辩论</a>”的活动时，人们纷纷倾听。<br><br> <em>《连线》杂志</em>2003 年 9 月摘录了他的小册子，标题为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wired.com/2003/09/ppt2/">PowerPoint 是邪恶的</a>”。几个月后， <em>《纽约时报》杂志</em>将 Tufte 的评价纳入其年度最有趣、最重要的想法的回顾中，总结为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-powerpoint-makes-you-dumb.html">PowerPoint 让你变得愚蠢</a>”。 “也许 PowerPoint 特别适合我们这个混乱的现代时代，”该条目写道，并指出<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/09/politics/powell-calls-his-un-speech-a-lasting-blot-on-his-record.html">科林·鲍威尔</a>刚刚<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20031118030817/http:/www.state.gov/documents/organization/17434.pdf">使用该软件</a>向联合国提交了伊拉克大规模杀伤性武器的证据。<br><br>几页上是该杂志令人兴奋的新想法列表中的另一个值得注意的条目： <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/14/magazine/2003-the-3rd-annual-year-in-ideas-social-networks.html">社交网络</a>。尽管 PowerPoint 与<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/faith-certainty-and-the-presidency-of-george-w-bush.html">现实扭曲</a>和美国人很快称之为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/17/magazine/17FOB-onlanguage-t.html">真实性</a>”的兴起联系在一起，但 Friendster、LinkedIn 和其他此类网络仍然没有定论。文章称，也许通过增强社会联系，他们可以减轻我们“深刻的民族孤独感”。也许他们只会“进一步将生活分裂成不同的领域——线上和线下。”或者也许它们不会那么具有变革性——至少与像 PowerPoint 这样普遍且有影响力的技术相比是这样。<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Tufte 现年 81 岁</span>，早已退休。根据他的最终统计，“ET 巡回演唱会”已经结束，共有 328,001 名参加者。这些天，他主要从事<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/sculpture">雕塑工作</a>。但他仍然是他自己：他仍然讨厌 PowerPoint。他仍然从称其为“PP”中获得了幼儿园孩子的喜悦。如果您访问 edwardtufte.com，您仍然可以以 14 美元的价格购买海报形式的斯大林漫画。<br><br>五月份，我给塔夫特发了一封电子邮件，询问他对 PowerPoint 的批评是否已经过时了。一如往常，他用专门为我编译的 16 页 PDF 进行了回答，其中包括他的书的摘录以及一些关于这些书的简介。他最终同意通过电话交谈，但我给他的第一个电话转到了语音信箱。 “在这片时间消失的土地上，外星人是不存在的，”他在电影预告片戏剧性的传出信息中咒语道。 “沟通的关键是语音信箱。或者短信。做吧！<em>嘟嘟</em>。<br><br>当我最终到达 ET 时，我问他，经过 20 年的稳定使用，PowerPoint 是否真的让我们变得愚蠢了。 “我不知道，”他说。 “我到过另一个星球。我现在是一名艺术家。”他接着说，从某种意义上说，他是最不该问的人，因为自 2003 年以来，没有人敢向他展示 PowerPoint 演示文稿。他还声称自己没有“记分”，但他知道——并且很感激——最近<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.workingbackwards.com/">有消息称</a>，他的工作帮助激励杰夫·贝佐斯禁止亚马逊高级管理人员使用 PowerPoint。<br><br>贝佐斯并不是唯一一个以塔夫特的方式看待事情的人。史蒂夫·乔布斯还禁止在某些公司会议上使用 PowerPoint。 2010 年在北卡罗来纳州举行的一次军事会议上，前国家安全顾问、时任陆军将军的 HR 麦克马斯特 (HR McMaster) 将 PowerPoint 描述为一种内部威胁；他曾在 2005 年袭击伊拉克城市塔尔阿法尔期间禁止使用它。“PowerPoint 让我们变得愚蠢，”詹姆斯·马蒂斯 (James Mattis) 将军在同一次会议上说道。 2011 年，瑞士的一位前软件工程师组建了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.anti-powerpoint-party.com/">反 PowerPoint 党</a>，这是一个（某种意义上）真正致力于对抗幻灯片暴政的政党。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/07/is-google-making-us-stupid/306868/">阅读：谷歌让我们变得愚蠢吗？</a><br><br>塔夫特的文章也面临着一些批评。一些人指责他为了提高他的课程出勤率而制造争议。其他人则表示，他犯了一个错误，因为他将该软件与用户的习惯混淆了。 “任何对 PowerPoint 的普遍反对都是愚蠢的，”哈佛大学心理学家史蒂文·平克 (Steven Pinker) 2009 年对<em>《</em><em>华尔街日报》</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204619004574318473921093400">表示</a>。“这就像谴责讲座一样——在糟糕的 PowerPoint 演示出现之前，还有糟糕的有脚本的讲座、无脚本的讲座、幻灯片、粉笔演讲等等。”长期担任麦肯锡商业视觉演示总监的吉恩·泽拉兹尼 (Gene Zelazny) 将塔夫特的论点<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.robertgaskins.com/files/five-experts-dispute-edward-tufte-on-powerpoint-sociable-media-cliff-atkinson.htm">总结</a>为“将司机造成的事故归咎于汽车”。<br><br>这种比较的问题在于，我们的交通系统<em>确实</em>对美国每年发生的 30,000 至 40,000 起车祸死亡负有一定责任，因为它让司机陷入了引发事故的境地。塔夫特告诉我，PowerPoint 也有类似的效果，它会积极促进糟糕的演示。 “这对演讲者来说很方便，”他说，“但对观众和内容来说却很不方便，而且有害。”<br><br>但如果所有这些糟糕的演讲真的导致了广泛的社会弊病，那么证据就很难找到。一些科学家试图对所谓的 PowerPoint 效应进行<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228864609_The_PowerPoint_Presentation_and_Its_Corollaries_How_Genres_Shape_Communicative_Action_in_Organizations">正式</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/20868864">衡量</a>，询问该软件是否真的影响我们处理信息的能力。瑞士圣加仑大学创意与设计教授塞巴斯蒂安·科恩巴赫 (Sebastian Kernbach) 与人合着了多篇综合这些文献的评论。他告诉我，总体而言，研究表明塔夫特的观点部分正确，部分错误。 PowerPoint 似乎并没有让我们变得愚蠢——例如，没有证据表明使用它的人的信息保留率较低或普遍认知能力下降——但它确实强加了一系列关于信息应该如何传达的假设：松散地、以要点的形式，并由演示者向被动听众的观众传达。克恩巴赫说，这些假设甚至重塑了幻灯片时代的物理环境：研讨会桌曾经配置为圆形，但在使用 PowerPoint 后，已被弯曲成 U 形以容纳演示者。<br><br>当我与科恩巴赫交谈时，他正在准备向一家大型政府组织的一群员工进行关于视觉思维的不同方法的演讲。 He said he planned to use a flip chart, draw on blank slides like a whiteboard, and perhaps even have audience members do some drawing of their own.但他也准备使用常规的旧 PowerPoint 幻灯片。他告诉我，这样做将为他的听众“标志着准备和专业精神”。该组织是美国宇航局。<br><br>美国航天局<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/kathrynlueders_lgbtq_vendor_equity_forum_presentation.pptx">仍然使用</a>PowerPoint 这一事实并不令人意外。尽管它引起了媒体的强烈反对，激起了亿万富翁的愤怒，并在军队内部引起了红色警报，但企业演示的盛行仍在继续。微软 PowerPoint 产品副总裁 Shawn Villaron 表示，该程序的每月用户数量比以往任何时候都多，已达数亿。如果说有什么不同的话，那就是它的用例已经激增。封锁期间，人们在 Zoom 上举办<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.elitedaily.com/p/heres-how-to-host-a-powerpoint-party-for-a-creative-get-together-22793116">PowerPoint 派对</a>。现在，当孩子们想养一只小狗、退出足球或参加 Niall Horan 见面会时，他们可以为父母<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/style/kids-who-use-powerpoint-to-ask-for-things.html">做 PowerPoint 演示</a>。如果 PowerPoint 是邪恶的，那么邪恶就统治了世界。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">至少从表面上看</span>，PowerPoint 让我们变得愚蠢的想法看起来像是教科书上误导性的技术末日论案例。当我要求塔夫特重新审视他的批评时，他表示反对，但在后来的谈话中，我更直接地向他询问了这个问题：他自己对一项新技术的批评是否有可能没有达到目标，就像过去许多其他人所做的那样？对 PowerPoint 的担忧与对印刷机或<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.collisiondetection.net/mt/archives/2010/12/will_the_word_p.php">文字处理器</a>的担忧有什么不同吗？<br><br>在我把这个想法说完之前，他插嘴了。他明显恼怒地说道，这个问题无法回答。 “我不做大的思考，大的废话，”他告诉我。 “我就在战壕里，正在进行沟通。”我认为他的意思是他不参与任何形式的远程抽象历史思考。<br><br>我尝试缩小问题范围。我说，今天对社交媒体的担忧与 PowerPoint 的批评有一定的相似之处。两者都归结为一种担忧，即新媒体技术重视形式而不是实质，它们的设计目的是吸引我们的注意力而不是传达真理，而且它们让我们变得愚蠢。有没有可能——有没有可能——塔夫特做出了正确的批评，但却批评了错误的技术？他没有这样的感觉。他说，PowerPoint 和社交媒体之间的比较是“挥手、胡说和机会主义”。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/07/social-media-harm-facebook-meta-response/670975/">阅读：是的，社交媒体确实正在破坏民主</a><br><br>尽管有这样的驳回，我们还是很容易会产生反事实，并想知道如果塔夫特和我们其他人早在 2003 年就担心社交媒体而不是演示软件，事情会如何发展。也许一本关于<em>Friendster 认知风格的</em>及时小册子或<em>断言</em>“LinkedIn 是邪恶的”的《连线》头条会改变历史的进程。如果过去几年社交媒体的强烈抵制从一开始就存在，也许 Facebook 永远不会成长为现在这样的庞然大物，这个国家也永远不会变得如此绝望的分裂。<br><br>或者也可能什么都不会改变。无论他们的时机如何，也无论他们的适应性如何，对新媒体的担忧似乎很少产生影响。反对意见遭到压制。新技术占据了主导地位。多年后，当我们回顾过去并想，<em>我们如此不安是多么奇怪</em>，这项技术的影响很可能是看不见的。<br><br>书面文字是否摧毁了我们的记忆？广播是否缩短了我们的注意力范围？ PowerPoint 是否让我们变成了企业官僚？如果这些创新确实改变了我们的思维方式，那么我们就会用改变的思维来衡量它们的影响。这些批评要么是错误的，要么是正确的，以至于我们无法再区分。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 23 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

href="https://www.businessinsider.com/scarsdale-new-york-east-coast-richest-town-photo-tour-2019-3">最富有的</a>社区之一，其居民确实是自由派。 2020 年，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/2020-election/results/new-york/">四分之三</a>的斯卡斯代尔选民将选票投给了乔·拜登，而不是唐纳德·特朗普。人们可以有把握地推测，很少有斯卡斯代尔居民是特朗普在墨西哥边境修建隔离墙的热心支持者。但他们中的许多人支持一种不太明显的隔离墙，这种隔离墙是根据分区法规建立的，禁止多户住宅，并将非富人（其中许多是有色人种）排除在社区之外。<br><br>在全国范围内，许多优秀的白人自由主义者，他们购买<em>《白人脆弱性》</em>的副本并谴责美国最高法院终止平权行动，每天晚上都睡在专属郊区，这些郊区通过政府法令对经济（从而种族）隔离进行社会设计。高档城市和较贫困的邻居之间的巨大不平等并不是凭空出现的；它们在很大程度上是法律的产物，这些法律很难与许多受过高等教育的深蓝色郊区草坪上的包容性<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/29/arts/in-this-house-yard-signs.html">“在这所房子里，我们相信”的标志相一致</a>。<br><br>在世纪基金会的一份<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tcf.org/content/report/how-zoning-drives-educational-inequality-the-case-of-westchester-county/">新报告</a>中，我将斯卡斯代尔与另一个韦斯特切斯特县郊区切斯特港进行了对比，后者仅距八英里，但人口统计数据却截然不同。斯卡斯代尔的家庭收入中位数超过<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/scarsdalevillagenewyork/PST045222">25 万美元</a>，几乎是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/portchestervillagenewyork/PST045222">切斯特港</a>的三倍，拥有大学学位的居民比例也是如此。切斯特港四分之三的小学生有资格在学校享受免费或减价餐，而斯卡斯代尔的学生则只有零。在斯卡斯代尔，87% 的居民是非西班牙裔白人或亚裔美国人，而切斯特港 69% 的居民是黑人或西班牙裔。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/black-families-leaving-cities-suburbs/671331/">耶路撒冷德姆萨斯：是什么导致了黑人的逃亡？</a><br><br>在斯卡斯代尔的绝大多数土地上，建造除单户住宅以外的任何东西都是非法的。根据纽约大学弗曼中心为该报告收集的数据，斯卡斯代尔的地块中只有 0.2% 的建筑被归类为两户或三户住宅或公寓。相比之下，切斯特港大约一半的土地允许建造多户住宅。从 2014 年到 2021 年，切斯特港批准的新住房单元中有 41% 是多户住宅。 In Scarsdale, none of the 218 units permitted were for a multifamily home.当斯卡斯代尔提议建造多户住宅时，居民提出了许多反对意见，其中许多是虚假的。例如，一些人反对公寓，理由是多户住宅会导致学校过度拥挤，尽管数据显示近年来斯卡斯代尔村的入学率一直在下降。<br><br>事实上，许多为孩子寻求更好生活的人都希望有机会搬到斯卡斯代尔。在我为我的新书<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/excluded-how-snob-zoning-nimbyism-and-class-bias-build-the-walls-we-don-t-see-richard-d-kahlenberg/9781541701465?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《排除：势利分区、邻避主义和阶级偏见如何筑起我们看不到的围墙》</em></a>进行的采访中，来自全国各地的低薪单亲母亲反复表达了她们希望为孩子提供更好的学校的愿望。<br><br>正如我在世纪基金会报告中指出的那样，2020 年斯卡斯代尔在每个学生上的支出比切斯特港多了近 5,500 美元，并且学生与教师的比例较低。 2019 年，切斯特港 32% 的学生英语成绩达到年级水平，而斯卡斯代尔的这一比例为 87%，差距高达 55 个百分点。在数学方面，切斯特港学生有 35% 的成绩达到年级水平，而斯卡斯代尔学生的这一比例为 90%，差距也为 55 分。研究<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tcf.org/content/report/housing-policy-school-policy-economically-integrative-housing-promotes-academic-success-montgomery-county-maryland/">表明</a>，当低收入学生有机会进入贫困程度较低的学校时，他们可以在五到七年的时间内将与中产阶级同龄人在数学方面的成绩差距缩小一半，在阅读方面的成绩差距缩小三分之一。他们只是很少有选择。<br><br>电视摄像机有助于描绘在边境被拒之门外的移民家庭的困境，但它们并没有捕捉到切斯特港等地的工薪阶层家庭被排除在斯卡斯代尔等地机会较高的公立学校之外的情况，这些学校禁止建造弱势家庭能够负担得起的房屋类型。尽管斯卡斯代尔的家长可能会试图通过支持切斯特港等地增加国家教育支出来调和排斥与他们的政治自由主义之间的关系， <a data-event-element="inline link"

In fact, many psychologists used to believe that after young adulthood, people tend to settle into their personality. That&#39;s largely true, Faith writes, but only until a certain point: “More recent studies suggest that something unexpected happens to many people as they reach and pass their 60s: Their personality starts changing again.”<br><br> This finding speaks to the capacity of older people to adapt. But as Faith writes, it also tells us something about the circumstances that many older adults contend with, and how society might better support them. Today&#39;s newsletter will explore some of the more wondrous elements of older age. Aging is not easy, but many older adults speak of their current stage of life with satisfaction and joy.

At 83 you enjoy the moment, and time travel here and there in the past 8 decades. You don&#39;t fret about seeming old, because hey, you really are old! You and your friends make Old jokes.

Bud Light has been America&#39;s best-selling beer since 2001, but its run at the top finally seems to be ending. The troubles started in April, when the brand unveiled a sponsorship deal with the transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney, sparking a massive anti-trans backlash. Kid Rock <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/culture/pride/kid-rock-shoots-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney-campaign-1235298048/">filmed himself</a> blasting cases of Bud Light with a rifle. A boycott swiftly spread. By June, the Mexican lager Modelo Especial had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/modelo-tops-bud-light-top-selling-beer-us-may-rcna89350">claimed</a> the top spot in retail sales, according to the market-research firm NielsenIQ. By one measure, at least, Bud Light was officially no longer America&#39;s most popular beer.<br><br> The boycott&#39;s success was stunning. Bud Light had been so popular, for so long, that its sudden decline seemed unthinkable. The truth, however, is that its dominance was never as secure as it appeared, and the boycott merely accelerated an existing trend. America no longer shares a united taste for beer. There are more than 9,500 craft breweries in the country turning out flavorful IPAs and fruited sour ales—the antithesis of light lager—and beer faces ever-stiffer competition from cocktails, wine, spirits, and seltzers. Grabbing a light lager is hardly today&#39;s drinking default. Even when it is, no law of nature requires Americans to prefer Bud Light over similarly bland competitors.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/bud-light-boycott-consumer-effect/674446/">James Surowiecki: The bitter truth about the Bud Light boycott</a><br><br> “We have the most diverse collection of drinkers in the country&#39;s history, who get to choose from the most diverse collection of beverage alcohol brands that have ever existed,” says Bryan Roth, the editor of the alcoholic-beverage newsletter <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.goodbeerhunting.com/sightlines">Sightlines</a> . If Bud Light doesn&#39;t appeal to people, they “can very easily find something that does.”<br><br> H <span class="smallcaps">umans have</span> fermented beer for millennia, but American light beer only dates to the early 1940s, when Coors Brewing Company introduced Coors Light. That brand was quickly discontinued, however, because of World War II grain shortages. The real story of light beer begins in the 1960s, when Brooklyn&#39;s Rheingold Brewery developed a low-calorie, zero-carbohydrate beer using a process invented by the Swiss chemist Hersch Gablinger. They named it Gablinger&#39;s Beer.<br><br> Rheingold released Gablinger&#39;s in 1967, positioning it as a diet drink for calorie-conscious women. It flopped. Joseph L. Owades, Rheingold&#39;s in-house biochemist, then shared the recipe with Chicago&#39;s Meister Bräu, where it became “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4818642458_dc8a10e425_z.jpg">lusty, full strength</a> ” Meister Bräu Lite. After Meister Bräu went bankrupt in 1972, Miller Brewing bought the brand, reformulated it, and reintroduced it as the 96-calorie Miller Lite. It would be the first truly mass-market American light beer.<br><br> Executives at Anheuser-Busch, Budweiser&#39;s parent company, were skeptical. “We think our beer is light enough,” the company&#39;s vice president of brewing said at the time. (In 2008, Anheuser-Busch merged with the Belgian conglomerate InBev to form Anheuser-Busch InBev, the world&#39;s largest brewer.)<i> </i>They were quickly proved wrong. Miller seems to have been the first company to discover that having success with light lager is less about how it&#39;s brewed than about how it&#39;s marketed. Miller Lite went national in 1975 with an advertising onslaught featuring professional athletes selling men on a lager that tasted great and was less filling. The message was: Guys can drink light beer too!有效。 Miller Lite became a hit, shipping 5 million barrels in its first full year. Other companies were forced to respond. Coors brought back Coors Light, and Anheuser-Busch debuted Natural Light and Michelob Light in 1977 and 1978, respectively. But the company was reluctant to release a light version of Budweiser, America&#39;s best-selling beer.<br><br> “They didn&#39;t want to hang their company on it,” says William Knoedelseder, the author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/bitter-brew-pb-william-knoedelseder/9780062009272?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Bitter Brew</i></a> , a history of the Anheuser-Busch dynasty. Chairman August A. Busch III, the great-grandson of the founder, Adolphus Busch, viewed Budweiser as the company&#39;s “crowning glory” and the family&#39;s heritage. “Nothing with the Budweiser name on it had ever failed.”<br><br> By 1981, however, with Miller Lite sales accelerating, the pressure was too great to resist. Busch needed to bet on his lead horse. He commissioned a recipe for what he called Budweiser Light. “He was investing a century&#39;s worth of brand loyalty with this product,” Knoedelseder says. After tinkering with the recipe to lessen bitterness, per the chairman&#39;s standards, the company debuted Budweiser Light in 1982 with commercials featuring a galloping Clydesdale that aired during sporting events. Bud Light, as it was later named, sold well among young and middle-aged professionals, but sales still lagged Miller Lite&#39;s.<br><br> A Super Bowl ad changed everything. In 1987, Anheuser-Busch made a play for younger male drinkers with a 30-second <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T18XOQppkkY">spot</a> during the big game featuring a bull terrier named Spuds MacKenzie—“Bud Light&#39;s original party animal!” Spuds became a pop-culture sensation, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K5BgCI-U7c">skateboarding in sunglasses</a> and drawing the thirsty gaze of scantily clad women. “He&#39;s Spuds MacKenzie,” the narrator of a later ad exclaimed: “One party-loving, happening dude!” (Never mind that the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56228/life-death-and-resurrection-spuds-mackenzie-original-party-animal">dog who played Spuds</a> was female.) Spuds came to embody the fun-loving-frat-boy image that set Bud Light apart from the more staid Budweiser brand.<br><br> The splashy ads helped boost Bud Light&#39;s sales 21 percent in the first full year. By late 1994, Bud Light had passed Miller Lite as America&#39;s best-selling light lager and trailed only Budweiser among all beers, meaning Anheuser-Busch owned the top two spots. Seven years later, in 2001, Bud Light passed Budweiser to become America&#39;s best-selling beer, period: a staple at grocery stores and bars, a ubiquitous option at the ballpark, an entry-level lager to crush at college parties and tailgates.<br><br> But the light-lager market was never a monopoly. If you decide to give up Bud Light, it&#39;s relatively painless to switch to the likes of Coors Light or Miller Lite. Drinkers view such brands as “interchangeable,” says Harry Schuhmacher, the publisher of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://beernet.com/"><i>Beer Business Daily</i></a> : “They&#39;re the same price and they taste the same.” What matters is how customers feel about the brand. Fueled by strong marketing and a loyal Hispanic customer base, the importer Constellation Brands has cultivated a broad following for Modelo Especial. Michelob Ultra, which slightly outsold Bud Light in recent scan data (and which is also owned by Anheuser-Busch InBev), is positioned as a light beer for active, health-conscious drinkers to enjoy after cardio or golfing 18 holes.<br><br> “They&#39;re never getting that volume back,” says Dave Infante, who publishes the drinks newsletter <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fingers.email/about">Fingers</a> . Bud Light sales <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/bud-light-ad-agency-search-ab-inbev-beer-marketing-strategy-and-history/2421881">peaked</a> at 42.4 million barrels in 2008 and had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brewbound.com/news/beer-marketers-insights-50-years-in-beer-volume-flattens-suppliers-grow-brands-shrink/">dropped</a> to 25.7 million barrels by 2020. Even before the boycott, “it was always preordained that it wasn&#39;t going to be the best-selling beer in the country.”<br><br> “I had a really clear job to do when I took over Bud Light, and it was, &#39;This brand is in decline, it&#39;s been in a decline for a really long time, and if we do not attract young drinkers to come and drink this brand, there will be no future for Bud Light,&#39;” Alissa Heinerscheid, vice president of marketing for Bud Light, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ninesliving.com/make-yourself-at-home-podcast-alissa-heinerscheid-bud-light/">told</a> the <i>Make Yourself at Home</i> podcast in March. A month later, Heinerscheid was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/business/anheuser-execs-on-leave/index.html">placed</a> on leave as the company tried to control the fallout of the anti-Mulvaney boycott. Her effort to shed the company&#39;s frat-boy image may have been too tall an order for a brand that built its empire by encouraging young men to imagine themselves as a literal horndog.<br><br> L <span class="smallcaps">et&#39;s not get</span> carried away, though. Just as Bud Light&#39;s seemingly unshakable dominance was exaggerated, so too is the idea that it&#39;s in a death spiral. Agitation over beer is nothing new. “The brewing industry has sustained a number of different consumer movements like this, in part because beer is ubiquitous in American life and easily recognizable,” says Allyson P. Brantley, the author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/brewing-a-boycott-how-a-grassroots-coalition-fought-coors-and-remade-american-consumer-activism-allyson-p-brantley/9781469661032?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Brewing a Boycott</i></a> <i>.</i> In 1966, two Denver-based Hispanic groups launched a boycott against Coors Brewing Company over its treatment of its Mexican American workers; it <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cpr.org/2014/10/03/the-coors-boycott-when-a-beer-can-signaled-your-politics/">lasted until 1987</a> . Jesse Jackson led a 1982 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/07/us/around-the-nation-boycott-of-busch-beers-sought-by-jesse-jackson.html">boycott against Anheuser-Busch</a> to protest its lack of Black-owned distributors. Remember those controversies?可能不会。 “Americans tend to not have very good lasting memories of boycotts,” Brantley says.<br><br> Coors responded to the backlash by creating subsidiary brands that hid the corporate connection, such as Killian&#39;s Irish Red and Zima. (After mergers, Coors is now part of Molson Coors Beverage Company, a juggernaut that also owns Miller.) “You have to be a really knowledgeable consumer when you&#39;re standing there in the beer aisle to know where these different products come from,” Brantley says. That dynamic seems guaranteed to blunt the impact of the latest boycott on Anheuser-Busch InBev&#39;s bottom line. In America, the conglomerate <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.anheuser-busch.com/brands">offers</a> more than 100 brands that include not only Michelob Ultra and Busch Light but also the likes of Stella Artois and Hoegaarden, plus once-independent craft breweries such as Goose Island. Representative Dan Crenshaw, the Texas Republican, tried dissing Bud Light by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/dan-crenshaw-bud-light-boycott-17888792.php">displaying</a> a fridge full of beer from Karbach, a Houston brewery owned by … Anheuser-Busch InBev. The bucks go to the same bank account.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/craft-beer-industry/550850/">Read: Craft beer is the strangest, happiest economic story in America</a><br><br> Even Bud Light&#39;s new second-place standing requires more context. Reported figures don&#39;t include draft sales at bars, restaurants, and other venues where you&#39;re more likely to find Bud Light than Modelo Especial. By volume, Bud Light is “still easily the No. 1 beer year to date,” says Roth of Sightlines.<br><br> But tastes change. Schlitz was once America&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://beerconnoisseur.com/articles/schlitz-how-milwaukees-famous-beer-became-infamous">best-selling beer</a> , and the original Budweiser&#39;s run ended in 2001. Bud Light rose to prominence as a good-time brand that brings the party: <i>Our beer is fun! Drink a lot of it!</i> Today&#39;s drinkers tend to have a more sophisticated self-conception. They also have far more options—and opinions. Beer exists in a fractious world in which anything can become ammo in the culture war, be it Disney movies or clothing at Target. No beer brand will ever be so dominant again. It&#39;s difficult to know quite how to feel. Bud Light, engineered to be bland and widely appealing, is hardly a point of national pride. And yet the fracturing of the beverage market represents a certain loss of shared culture. There&#39;s something bittersweet about that. Just a little, though.

When the policy went into effect early the next year, it lifted the fear of prosecution for the state&#39;s drug users and launched Oregon on an experiment to determine whether a long-sought goal of the drug-policy reform movement—decriminalization—could help solve America&#39;s drug problems.<br><br> Early results of this reform effort, the first of its kind in any state, are now coming into view, and so far, they are not encouraging. State leaders have acknowledged faults with the policy&#39;s implementation and enforcement measures. And Oregon&#39;s drug problems have not improved. Last year, the state experienced one of the<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm">sharpest rises</a> in overdose deaths in the nation and had one of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/579bd717c534a564c72ea7bf/t/643988bad6f8d913a4f61afc/1681492164612/2022+Annual+Report+-+FINAL+2.pdf">highest percentages</a> of adults with a substance-use disorder. During one two-week period last month, three children under the age of 4 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/news/read.cfm?id=492958">overdosed</a> in Portland after ingesting fentanyl.<br><br> For decades, drug policy in America centered on using law enforcement to target people who sold, possessed, or used drugs—an approach long supported by both Democratic and Republican politicians. Only in recent years, amid an epidemic of opioid overdoses and a national reconsideration of racial inequities in the criminal-justice system, has the drug-policy status quo begun to break down, as a coalition of health workers, criminal-justice-reform advocates, and drug-user activists have lobbied for a more compassionate and nuanced response. The new approach emphasizes reducing overdoses, stopping the spread of infectious disease, and providing drug users with the resources they need—counseling, housing, transportation—to stabilize their lives and gain control over their drug use.<br><br> Oregon&#39;s Measure 110 was viewed as an opportunity to prove that activists&#39; most groundbreaking idea—sharply reducing the role of law enforcement in the government&#39;s response to drugs—could work. The measure also earmarked hundreds of millions of dollars in cannabis tax revenue for building a statewide treatment network that advocates promised would do what police and prosecutors couldn&#39;t: help drug users stop or reduce their drug use and become healthy, engaged members of their communities. The day after the measure passed, Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, one of the nation&#39;s most prominent drug-policy reform organizations, issued a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230225033031/https:/www.drugpolicy.org/blog/2020elections">statement</a> calling the vote a “historic, paradigm-shifting win” and predicting that Oregon would become “a model and starting point for states across the country to decriminalize drug use.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/harm-reduction-decriminalization-fentanyl-meth/674214/">Sam Quinones: America&#39;s approach to addiction has gone off the rails</a><br><br> But three years later, with rising overdoses and delays in treatment funding, even some of the measure&#39;s supporters now believe that the policy needs to be changed. In a nonpartisan statewide <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dhmresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/DHM-Panel-Oregon_Measure110_May-2023.pdf">poll</a> earlier this year, more than 60 percent of respondents blamed Measure 110 for making drug addiction, homelessness, and crime worse. A majority, including a majority of Democrats, said they supported bringing back criminal penalties for drug possession. This year&#39;s legislative session, which ended in late June, saw at least a dozen Measure 110–related proposals from Democrats and Republicans alike, ranging from technical fixes to full restoration of criminal penalties for drug possession. Two significant changes—tighter restrictions on fentanyl and more state oversight of how Measure 110 funding is distributed—passed with bipartisan support.<br><br> Few people consider Measure 110 “a success out of the gate,” Tony Morse, the policy and advocacy director for Oregon Recovers, told me. The organization, which promotes policy solutions to the state&#39;s addiction crisis, initially opposed Measure 110; now it supports funding the policy, though it also wants more state money for in-patient treatment and detox services. As Morse put it, “If you take away the criminal-justice system as a pathway that gets people into treatment, you need to think about what is going to replace it.”<br><br> Many advocates say the new policy simply needs more time to prove itself, even if they also acknowledge that parts of the ballot measure had flaws; advocates worked closely with lawmakers on the oversight bill that passed last month. “We&#39;re building the plane as we fly it,” Haven Wheelock, a program supervisor at a homeless-services provider in Portland who helped put Measure 110 on the ballot, told me. “We tried the War on Drugs for 50 years, and it didn&#39;t work … It hurts my heart every time someone says we need to repeal this before we even give it a chance.”<br><br> Measure 110 went into effect at a time of dramatic change in US drug policy. Departing from precedent, the Biden administration has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/National-Drug-Control-2022Strategy.pdf">endorsed</a> and increased federal funding for a public-health strategy called harm reduction; rather than pushing for abstinence, harm reduction emphasizes keeping drug users safe—for instance, through the distribution of clean syringes and overdose-reversal medications. The term <em>harm reduction</em> appeared five times in the ballot <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sos.oregon.gov/admin/Documents/irr/2020/044text.pdf">text</a> of Measure 110, which forbids funding recipients from “mandating abstinence.”<br><br> Matt Sutton, the director of external relations for the Drug Policy Alliance, which helped write Measure 110 and spent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://secure.sos.state.or.us/orestar/gotoPublicTransactionSearchResults.do?cneSearchButtonName=prev&amp;cneSearchFilerCommitteeId=20089&amp;cneSearchContributorTxtSearchType=C&amp;cneSearchFilerCommitteeTxtSearchType=C&amp;srtOrder=asc&amp;by=NAME&amp;cneSearchPageIdx=">more than $5 million</a> to pass it, told me that reform advocates viewed the measure as the start of a nationwide decriminalization push. The effort started in Oregon because the state had been an early adopter of marijuana legalization and is considered a drug-policy-reform leader. Success would mean showing the rest of the country that “people did think we should invest in a public-health approach instead of criminalization,” Sutton said.<br><br> To achieve this goal, Measure 110 enacted two major changes to Oregon&#39;s drug laws. First, minor drug possession was downgraded from a misdemeanor to a violation, similar to a traffic ticket. Under the new law, users caught with up to 1 gram of heroin or methamphetamine, or up to 40 oxycodone pills, are charged a $100 fine, which can be waived if they call a treatment-referral hotline. (Selling, trafficking, and possessing large amounts of drugs remain criminal offenses in Oregon.) Second, the law set aside a portion of state cannabis tax revenue every two years to fund a statewide network of harm-reduction and other services. A grant-making panel was created to oversee the funding process. At least six members of the panel were required to be directly involved in providing services to drug users; at least two had to be active or former drug users themselves; and three were to be “members of communities that have been disproportionately impacted” by drug criminalization, according to the ballot measure.<br><br> Backers of Measure 110 said the law was modeled on drug policies in Portugal, where personal drug possession was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/drugs-library/portugals-national-drug-strategy-1999-english-version_en">decriminalized</a> two decades ago. But Oregon&#39;s enforcement-and-treatment-referral system differs from Portugal&#39;s. Users caught with drugs in Portugal are referred to a civil commission that evaluates their drug use and recommends treatment if needed, with civil sanctions for noncompliance. Portugal&#39;s state-run health system also funds a nationwide network of treatment services, many of which focus on sobriety. Sutton said drafters of Measure 110 wanted to avoid anything that might resemble a criminal tribunal or coercing drug users into treatment. “People respond best when they&#39;re ready to access those services in a voluntary way,” he said.<br><br> Almost immediately after taking effect, Measure 110 encountered problems. A state <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sos.oregon.gov/audits/Documents/2023-03.pdf">audit</a> published this year found that the new law was “vague” about how state officials should oversee the awarding of money to new treatment programs, and set “unrealistic timelines” for evaluating and funding treatment proposals. As a result, the funding process was left largely to the grant-making panel, most of whose members “lacked experience in designing, evaluating and administrating a governmental-grant-application process,” according to the audit. Last year, supporters of Measure 110 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelundreport.org/content/people-are-dying-while-state-bureaucracy-holds-treatment-dollars-say-measure-110-proponents">accused</a> state health officials, preoccupied with the coronavirus pandemic, of giving the panel insufficient direction and resources to handle a flood of grant applications. The state health authority <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2021I1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/255650">acknowledged missteps</a> in the grant-making process.<br><br> The audit described a chaotic process, with more than a dozen canceled meetings, potential conflicts of interest in the selection of funding recipients, and lines of applicant evaluations left blank. Full distribution of the first biennial payout of cannabis tax revenue—$302 million for harm reduction, housing, and other services—did not occur until late 2022, almost two years after Measure 110 passed. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiODU1NDNlNzUtMDBkNy00NTM1LWE4NzgtNGEyNzQxYWY0NTU2IiwidCI6IjY1OGU2M2U4LThkMzktNDk5Yy04ZjQ4LTEzYWRjOTQ1MmY0YyJ9&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=govdelivery">Figures</a> released by the state last month show that, in the second half of 2022, recipients of Measure 110 funding provided some form of service to roughly 50,000 “clients,” though <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelundreport.org/content/more-people-accessing-help-under-measure-110-gaps-services-data-remain">the Oregon Health Authority has said</a> that a single individual could be counted multiple times in that total. (A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelundreport.org/sites/default/files/OHSU%20-%20Oregon%20Gap%20Analysis%20and%20Inventory%20Report.pdf">study</a> released last year by public-health researchers in Oregon found that, as of 2020, more than 650,000 Oregonians required, but were not receiving, treatment for a substance-use disorder.)<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/05/nikki-king-opioid-treatment-program/609085/">From the May 2020 issue: America&#39;s other epidemic</a><br><br> Meanwhile, the new law&#39;s enforcement provisions have proved ineffectual. Of 5,299 drug-possession cases filed in Oregon circuit courts since Measure 110 went into effect, 3,381 resulted in a recipient failing to pay the fine or appear in court and facing no further penalties, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.courts.oregon.gov/about/Documents/BM110Statistics.pdf">according to</a> the Oregon Judicial Department; about 1,300 tickets were dismissed or are pending. The state audit found that, during its first 15 months in operation, the treatment-referral hotline received just 119 calls, at a cost to the state of $7,000 per call. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=ccj_fac">survey</a> of law-enforcement officers conducted by researchers at Portland State University found that, as of July 2022, officers were issuing an average of just 300 drug-possession tickets a month statewide, compared with 600 drug-possession arrests a month before Measure 110 took effect and close to 1,200 monthly arrests prior to the outbreak of COVID-19.<br><br> “Focusing on these tickets even though they&#39;ll be ineffective—it&#39;s not a great use of your resources,” Sheriff Nate Sickler of Jackson County, in the rural southern part of the state, told me of his department&#39;s approach.<br><br> Advocates have celebrated a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1114&amp;context=ccj_fac">plunge in arrests</a> . “For reducing arrests of people of color, it&#39;s been an overwhelming success,” says Mike Marshall, the director of Oregon Recovers. But critics say that sidelining law enforcement has made it harder to persuade some drug users to stop using. Sickler cited the example of drug-court programs, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/504">which</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/125">multiple</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/93">studies</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/128">have</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/478">shown</a> to be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/597">highly</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/69">effective</a> , including in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crimesolutions.ojp.gov/ratedprograms/115">Jackson County</a> . Use of such programs in the county has declined in the absence of criminal prosecution, Sickler said: “Without accountability or the ability to drive a better choice, these individuals are left to their own demise.”<br><br> The consequences of Measure 110&#39;s shortcomings have fallen most heavily on Oregon&#39;s drug users. In the two years after the law took effect, the number of annual overdoses in the state rose by 61 percent, compared with a 13 percent increase nationwide,<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm">according to</a> the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In neighboring Idaho and California, where drug possession remains subject to prosecution, the rate of increase was significantly lower than Oregon&#39;s. (The spike in Washington State was similar to Oregon&#39;s, but that comparison is more complicated because Washington&#39;s drug policy has fluctuated since 2021.) Other states once notorious for drug deaths, including West Virginia, Indiana, and Arkansas, are now experiencing declines in overdose rates.<br><br> In downtown Portland this spring, police cleared out what <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.oregonlive.com/crime/2023/04/portland-police-clear-out-washington-center-open-air-drug-market-in-early-morning-mission.html"><em>The Oregonian</em> called</a> an “open-air drug market” in a former retail center. Prominent businesses in the area, including the outdoor-gear retailer REI, have announced closures in recent months, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://oregonbusiness.com/rei-announces-closure-of-portland-store/">in part citing</a> a rise in shoplifting and violence. Earlier this year, Portland business owners <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wweek.com/news/2023/03/01/a-familiar-fight-between-businesses-and-county-officials-over-homeless-services-plays-out-in-portlands-hotel-district/">appeared</a> before the Multnomah County Commission to ask for help with crime, drug-dealing, and other problems stemming from a behavioral-health resource center operated by a harm-reduction nonprofit that was awarded more than $4 million in Measure 110 funding. In April, the center abruptly closed following employee complaints that clients were covering walls with graffiti and overdosing on-site. A subsequent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.multco.us/multnomah-county/news/behavioral-health-resource-center-reopens-after-undergoing-security-building">investigation</a> by the nonprofit found that a security contractor had been using cocaine on the job. The center reopened two weeks later with beefed-up security measures.<br><br> Portland&#39;s Democratic mayor, Ted Wheeler, went so far as to attempt an end run around Measure 110 in his city. Last month, Wheeler unveiled a proposal to criminalize public drug consumption in Portland, similar to existing bans on open-air drinking, saying in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.portland.gov/wheeler/documents/full-statement-ordinance/download">statement</a> that Measure 110 “is not working as it was intended to.” He added, “Portland&#39;s substance-abuse problems have exploded to deadly and disastrous proportions.” Wheeler withdrew the proposal days later after learning that an older state law prohibits local jurisdictions from banning public drug use.<br><br> Despite shifting public opinion on Measure 110, many Oregon leaders are not ready to give up on the policy. Earlier this month, Oregon Governor Tina Kotek signed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://olis.oregonlegislature.gov/liz/2023R1/Measures/Overview/HB2513">legislation</a> that strengthens state oversight of Measure 110 and requires an audit, due no later than December 2025, of about two dozen aspects of the measure&#39;s performance, including whether it is reducing overdoses. Other bills passed by the legislature&#39;s Democratic majority strengthened criminal penalties for possession of large quantities of fentanyl and mandated that school drug-prevention programs instruct students about the risks of synthetic opioids. Republican proposals to repeal Measure 110 outright or claw back tens of millions of dollars in harm-reduction funding were not enacted.<br><br> The fallout from Measure 110 has received some critical coverage from media outlets on the right. “It is predictable,” a scholar from the Hudson Institute <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/us/portland-drug-decriminalization-effort-tragedy">told Fox News</a> . “It is a tragedy and a self-inflicted wound.” (Meanwhile, in Portugal, the model for Oregon, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/07/portugal-drugs-decriminalization-heroin-crack/">some residents are raising questions</a> about their own nation&#39;s decriminalization policy.) But so far Oregon&#39;s experience doesn&#39;t appear to have stopped efforts to bring decriminalization to other parts of the United States. “We&#39;ll see more ballot initiatives,” Sutton, of the Drug Policy Alliance, said, adding that advocates are currently working with city leaders to decriminalize drugs in Washington, DC<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/01/naloxone-stronger-form-opioid-overdose/621254/">Read: An anti-overdose drug is getting stronger. Maybe that&#39;s a bad thing?</a><br><br> Supporters of Measure 110 are now seeking to draw attention to what they say are the policy&#39;s overlooked positive effects. This summer, the Health Justice Recovery Alliance, a Measure 110 advocacy organization, is leading an effort to spotlight expanded treatment services and boost community awareness of the treatment-referral hotline. Advocates are also coordinating with law-enforcement agencies to ensure that officers know about local resources for drug users. “People are hiring for their programs; outreach programs are expanding, offering more services,” Devon Downeysmith, the communications director for the group, told me.<br><br> An array of services around the state have been expanded through the policy: housing for pregnant women awaiting drug treatment; culturally specific programs for Black, Latino, and Indigenous drug users; and even distribution of bicycle helmets to people unable to drive to treatment meetings. “People often forget how much time it takes to spend a bunch of money and build services,” said Wheelock, the homeless-services worker, whose organization received more than $2 million in funding from Measure 110.<br><br> Still, even some recipients of Measure 110 funding wonder whether one of the law&#39;s pillars—the citation system that was supposed to help route drug users into treatment—needs to be rethought. “Perhaps some consequences might be a helpful thing,” says Julia Pinsky, a co-founder of Max&#39;s Mission, a harm-reduction nonprofit in southern Oregon. Max&#39;s Mission has received $1.5 million from Measure 110, enabling the organization to hire new staff, open new offices, and serve more people. Pinsky told me she is proud of her organization&#39;s work and remains committed to the idea that “you shouldn&#39;t have to go to prison to be treated for substance use.” She said that she doesn&#39;t want drug use to “become a felony,” but that some people aren&#39;t capable of stopping drug use on their own. “They need additional help.”<br><br> Brandi Fogle, a regional manager for Max&#39;s Mission, says her own story illustrates the complex trade-offs involved in reforming drug policy. Three and a half years ago, she was a homeless drug user, addicted to heroin and drifting around Jackson and Josephine Counties. Although she tried to stop numerous times, including one six-month period during which she was prescribed the drug-replacement medication methadone, she told me that a 2020 arrest for drug possession was what finally turned her life around. She asked to be enrolled in a 19-month drug-court program that included residential treatment, mandatory 12-step meetings, and a community-service project, and ultimately was hired by Pinsky.<br><br> Since Measure 110 went into effect, Fogle said, she has gotten pushback from members of the community for the work Max&#39;s Mission does. She said that both the old system of criminal justice and the new system of harm reduction can benefit drug users, but that her hope now is to make the latter approach more successful. “Everyone is different,” Fogle said. “Drug court worked for me because I chose it, and I wouldn&#39;t have needed drug court in the first place if I had received the kind of services Max&#39;s Mission provides. I want to offer people that chance.”<br><br> <small><em>This article originally suggested that REI&#39;</em> <em>s store in Portland had closed; it is scheduled to close early next year.</em></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 19 Jul 2023 14:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/oregon-drug-decriminalization-results-overdoses/674733/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/oregon-drug-decriminalization-results-overdoses/674733/</item></channel></rss>
