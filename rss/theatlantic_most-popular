日，美国德克萨斯州伊格尔帕斯，德克萨斯州警在格兰德河沿岸的铁丝网后面与移民交谈。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>乔丹·冯德哈尔/彭博/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>一名怀孕的少女因流产而被困在德克萨斯州南部边境绵延数英里的铁丝网中，痛苦地翻滚。<br><br>一名 4 岁女孩试图与家人一起穿过铁丝网，但被德克萨斯州国民警卫队成员推离铁丝网，她因中暑而倒下。<br><br>得克萨斯州警察接到上级命令，在三位数的高温下拒绝向移民供水。另一次，警察命令士兵将一群移民赶回格兰德河，其中包括儿童和婴儿，他们发现这些移民挤在河边的栅栏旁。<br><br>根据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/border-trooper-migrants-wire-18205076.php">《<em>休斯敦纪事报</em>》和《<em>圣安东尼奥快报》</em>本周发布的一封爆炸性电子邮件，德克萨斯州公共安全部的</a>一名医生表示，他在最近的巡逻中亲眼目睹了这些事件<em>。</em> “我相信我们已经跨过了一条不人道的界限[<em>原文如此</em>]，”医务人员尼古拉斯·温盖特(Nicholas Wingate)在电子邮件中写道。<br><br>这些揭露的内容不仅体现了德克萨斯州共和党州长格雷格·阿博特和州执法官员针对试图跨越美国与墨西哥边境的无证移民所采取的极端策略。它们还显示了德克萨斯州和其他共和党控制的州正在如何积极地采取行动，从乔·拜登总统的政府手中夺取对移民政策的控制权。在许多移民专家看来，德克萨斯州的这些举措，就像佛罗里达州州长罗恩·德桑蒂斯今年春天签署的针对无证移民的严厉措施一样，将各州侵犯联邦移民权力的法律限制推向了边缘。<br><br> “美国移民法管辖边境；德克萨斯州法律并不管辖边境，”美国移民律师协会前主席戴维·利奥波德 (David Leopold) 告诉我。他指出，联邦法律规定了处理在美国寻求庇护的无证移民的程序。 “这可能不是我喜欢的过程，或者你不喜欢的过程，或者德克萨斯州的人们不喜欢的过程，但它是一个过程，”利奥波德补充道。 “这个过程并不包括把一个 4 岁的孩子扔进水里……或者在温度超过 100 度时不让他们喝水。这些不是我们的价值观。这些不是我们的法律。”<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/operation-lone-star-statement-on-orders-addressing-illegal-crossings">发表了一份联合声明</a>，其中他们坚称，“这些工具和策略——包括勾住衣服的六角形铁丝网”对于阻止移民进行“可能危及生命的非法越境”是必要的。<br><br>红州针对无证移民的攻势正处于唐纳德·特朗普时代共和党内两种强大趋势的十字路口。其中之一是红色州日益兴起的取消广泛公民权利和自由的运动，包括投票权、堕胎权和 LGBTQ 保护。<br><br>另一个是共和党领导人之间的军备竞赛，要求对无证移民采取更加激进的政策。这种动力甚至让该党超越了特朗普在白宫所采取的强硬路线。<br><br>例如，德桑蒂斯和特朗普都承诺，如果当选，他们将采取行动终止与生俱来的公民身份，即第十四修正案保证任何在美国出生的人自动成为美国公民。特朗普<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/11/politics/transcript-cnn-town-hall-trump/index.html">在美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 的市政厅露面中</a>表示，他将恢复广受谴责的政策，即在边境将移民子女与父母分开，以阻止非法越境。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/immigration/trump-reveals-plan-largest-domestic-deportation--history">他还承诺</a>“利用所有必要的州、地方、联邦和军事资源来开展美国历史上最大规模的国内驱逐行动”。这是特朗普经常讨论的一个想法，但作为总统从未冒险尝试实施。<br><br>与此同时，德桑蒂斯<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://rondesantis.com/mission/stop-the-invasion">表示</a>，他将授权联邦边境执法人员对涉嫌毒品走私者使用武力。他还谈到，如果墨西哥不采取更积极的行动阻止用于制造毒品的化学品抵达，将部署海军和海岸警卫队。<br><br>与此同时，德桑蒂斯和阿博特一直站在红色州努力夺取移民政策更多控制权的最前沿。德桑蒂斯签署的立法包含打击无证移民的全面措施，包括对在佛罗里达州为此类移民提供交通的任何人进行刑事处罚。<br><br>就阿博特而言，他正在建立一个不受合法负责管理边境的联邦机构控制的执法机构。他的努力代表了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/04/tennessee-expulsions-republican-gop/673709/">我所说的</a>红色国家驱动力的最具体和最重要的表现之一，即建立“国中之国”，按照自己的规则和价值观运作。<br><br>阿博特并没有像保守派活动人士那样声称宪法赋予各州制定自己的移民政策的权利，理由是它们面临着无证移民的“入侵”。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2023/07/06/why-ron-desantis-is-talking-about-an-immigrant-invasion/">在德克萨斯州的一次竞选活动中</a>，德桑蒂斯接受了这种边缘法律理论，并认为它为各州（而不仅仅是联邦政府）提供了驱逐权。<br><br>大多数移民法专家都怀疑，即使是目前保守的最高法院多数派也会同意，而阿博特并没有声称拥有这一权力。他于 2021 年发起的大规模执法行动“孤星行动”并不是试图驱逐在该州逮捕的无证移民。相反，德克萨斯州将他们送回边境、逮捕他们或用巴士将他们送往民主党控制的司法管辖区。阿博特选择不根据入侵理论主张驱逐权，这引起了一些移民强硬派的持续批评。<br><br>然而，得克萨斯州警官温盖特在电子邮件中披露的信息表明，该州已经在篡夺联邦权力方面走了多远。它在南部边境布满了数英里长的蛇腹形铁丝网，并将缠绕在铁丝网中的木桶沉入河中。最近， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/06/08/rio-grande-buoys-greg-abbott/">该州在河中放置了漂浮浮标</a>，以封锁可能更容易、更安全地穿越的区域。州警和国民警卫队成员也使用武力将移民赶出铁丝网路障。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/operation-lone-star-deploys-new-border-security-deterrence-strategies">其他近十几个州的共和党州长</a>已向德克萨斯州派遣执法人员和/或设备，以支持阿博特的努力。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gov.texas.gov/uploads/files/press/Governors_Letter_Border_Support_1.pdf">阿博特在一封要求其他州提供资源的信中写道</a>：“在联邦政府缺席的情况下，我们作为州长，必须团结起来应对拜登总统持续的边境危机，确保所有美国人应得的安全和保障。”<br><br>温盖特在他的电子邮件中指出了这些努力的一个后果：“[刀片]铁丝网沿着河流延伸了几英里，人们更容易过河。它迫使人们穿越其他更深的区域，对于携带孩子和行李的人来说并不安全。”<br><br>他讲述了一名妇女和她的一个孩子在河里获救，而另一个孩子却溺水身亡的故事。温盖特还报告说，一名男子在从沉入河中的一个铁丝包裹的桶中救出孩子时，腿部“严重撕裂”。<br><br>德克萨斯州民主党众议员维罗尼卡·埃斯科瓦尔告诉我：“我们的州长实际上是在利用政府的全部力量对人们造成人身伤害，甚至死亡。” “他利用政府的事实并没有让这件事变得不那么可怕，也肯定不会让它变得合法。”<br><br>除了人力成本之外，红州边境执法工作还引发了有关法律权威的尖锐问题。埃斯科瓦尔和来自德克萨斯州的其他六名美国民主党代表<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://escobar.house.gov/uploadedfiles/letter_to_attorney_general_garland_and_secretary_blinken_on_rio_grande_floating_barriers.pdf">上周写信</a>给司法部长梅里克·加兰和国务卿安东尼·布林肯，要求他们调查艾伯特的浮标是否违反美国法和国际法，包括结束美墨战争的 1848 年《瓜达卢佩·伊达尔戈条约》。埃斯科瓦尔告诉我，她认为司法部不仅应该采取法律措施来阻止雅培的执法计划；拜登政府应该“派遣联邦人员消除”德克萨斯州建造的所有物理障碍。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/07/border-facilities/593239/">Adam Serwer：任何名字的犯罪</a><br><br>白宫本周谴责了电子邮件中披露的行为； <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2022/07/06/operation-lone-star-doj-investigation-abbott/"><em>《德克萨斯论坛报》</em>和 ProPublica</a>报道称，司法部已经在调查“孤星行动”是否违反联邦民权法。一位发言人周三<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/article/justice-department-border-migrants-18208973.php">表示</a>。该部门正在评估温盖特的指控，政府可能很快就会宣布进一步的行动。<br><br>白宫发言人阿卜杜拉·哈桑昨天晚些时候通过电子邮件告诉我，虽然白宫“不会领先”司法部的评估，但它会以最强烈的措辞谴责“阿博特州长的行为”。哈桑指责说，阿博特的行为“正在将移民和边境巡逻人员的生命置于危险之中，并且在我们的边境执法计划已将非法越境行为降至多年来的最低水平之际制造混乱。”<br><br>但许多移民倡导者与埃斯科瓦尔一样认为，拜登应该更有力地挑战红州对联邦移民当局的侵犯。<br><br> “需要对此进行联邦调查，”大卫·利奥波德告诉我。 “拜登政府应该带头要求这些南方州长立即停止在南部边境制造混乱。”<br><br>国土安全部部长亚历杭德罗·马约卡斯的前高级顾问安吉拉·凯利告诉我，拜登政府通常会在早期寻求尽量减少与阿博特的冲突，同时努力调整特朗普的许多联邦移民政策。但她说，德克萨斯州现在正在采取“实际上超出了特朗普儿童分离政策暴行的行动”。如果拜登感受到来自国会民主党人和倡导团体的压力，“我认为他们会采取行动，因为本届政府袖手旁观，让德克萨斯州在真正由联邦政府负责的领域推行此类政策，”现任美国移民律师协会首席政策顾问的凯利说。<br><br>具有讽刺意味的是，德克萨斯州正在采取这些严厉的措施，而<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/30/politics/immigration-border-security-worker-shortages-fault-lines/index.html">政府自己的计划</a>最终似乎正在减轻无证移民的压力。尽管预计<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/emergency-covid-pandemic-end-may-11/673954/">拜登今年春天结束特朗普大流行时期的第 42 条政策</a>时会出现混乱，但边境情况似乎有所稳定：周二， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-releases-june-2023-monthly-update">政府报告称</a>，从 5 月到 6 月，西南边境遇到的无证移民数量下降了 40% 以上，降至 2021 年初以来的最低月度水平。但民意调查持续显示，大多数美国人不赞成拜登处理移民问题，并在这个问题上更信任共和党人，阿博特和他的共和党州长同僚显然已经乐于接受更加极端的战术。<br><br>针对温盖特事件，德克萨斯州公共安全部官员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/07/18/texas-troopers-department-public-safety-migrants-rio-grande-border/">启动了内部调查，并否认</a>他们实施了拒绝向被捕移民供水或将他们推入河中的政策。但<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gov.texas.gov/news/post/operation-lone-star-statement-on-orders-addressing-illegal-crossings">在信息披露后的声明中</a>，阿博特明确表示，他无意退出孤星行动。保守的德克萨斯州立法者已经呼吁阿博特继续努力，当地政治观察家告诉我，他们怀疑他是否会以任何方式让步。<br><br>只要德克萨斯州的计划继续以目前的形式进行，更多的滥用行为可能就不可避免。比尔·克林顿(Bill Clinton)总统领导下的移民和归化局局长多丽丝·迈斯纳(Doris Meissner)指出，即使该州没有制定一项全面政策，要求采取诸如拒绝向移民供水等好战行动，但“可以预见的是，这种越权行为将会在个别单位发生”，因为该州正试图对那些“没有接受过这方面培训”的人执行移民法。德克萨斯州的其他几名公共安全官员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/19/us/texas-border-migrants-abbott.html?searchResultPosition=2">周四告诉<em>《纽约时报》</em></a> ，他们已收到命令，禁止向移民提供水源，并要求他们返回墨西哥。<br><br>阿博特愿意开展如此激进的执法行动，以及众多共和党州长决定协助他，这为同样的冲动提供了另一种衡量标准，这在限制或禁止堕胎、取消投票权以及禁止对变性未成年人进行性别肯定护理的红州法律中显而易见。所有这些都表明了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/12/republican-states-rights-restrictions/621101/">摆脱国家权威束缚并实施一套规则和政策的决心</a>，这些规则和政策反映了让这些州领导人掌权的主要是老年人、白人、非城市和基督教联盟的优先事项和不满。<br><br>正如利奥波德所说，这种冲动正在使这个国家产生危险的“巴尔干化”，让人想起内战前的几年。这也促使美国第二大州的领导层得出结论，无证移民的威胁足以在法律和道德上证明将儿童和孕妇缠在锋利的铁丝网中。<br><br></div>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊/盖蒂</figcaption></figure><span class="smallcaps">本周</span>，拜登政府非常悄悄地发表了反革命宣言。它并没有用激烈的言辞来宣扬。没有电视讲话或椭圆形办公室拍照——只有司法部和联邦贸易委员会的一份<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/d9/2023-07/2023-draft-merger-guidelines_0.pdf">备忘录草稿，</a>列出了他们将用来评估公司合并合法性的新标准。至少可以说，这不是今年将发布的最精彩的读物。但这可能是最重要的之一。<br><br>受到反击的革命也悄然开始。在新政和战后的大部分时间里，美国政府对合并采取了积极的立场。人们认为，经济实力的集中会威胁美国的核心价值观，甚至引发大萧条。反垄断机构往往对企业交易持怀疑态度，即使相关各方远未主宰市场。这种共识在 20 世纪 70 年代开始动摇。里根时代的到来彻底颠覆了它。 1982 年，政府<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/15/business/us-is-easing-68-antitrust-guidelines-on-mergers.html">发布了</a>自己的合并指导方针，明确表示积极反垄断执法的时代已经结束。<br><br>这在当时不是什么大新闻。今天的孩子们肯定不会在历史课上读到它。然而，政策转变以及限制反垄断法范围的法院裁决的影响是巨大的。此后的四十年里，美国经济变得<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2016/10/americas-monopoly-problem/497549/">危险地集中</a>，由数量不断减少的航空公司、银行、科技公司和制药公司（仅举几个例子）主导。企业巨头对政治进程积累了巨大的影响力，扼杀了初创企业，并且经常以令人震惊的冷漠态度对待消费者。如果对美国经济生活中的任何失调现象进行足够长时间的研究—— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/health/hospital-mergers-health-care-spending.html">医疗费用失控</a>、婴儿配方奶粉<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6177128/baby-formula-congress-monopoly-abbott/">短缺</a>、地区<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/11/cities-economic-fates-diverge/417372/">不平等</a>——你很可能会发现企业集中化是原因之一。<br><br>里根派为何这么做？他们受制于这样一种观念：经济政策的最高、事实上唯一、有效的目标是<i>效率</i>——狭隘地定义为最低价格的最大产出。他们相信大企业本质上是高效的。他们在巩固这一观点方面取得了毁灭性的成功。对于两代人来说，无论哪一方执政，他们的效率观都成为竞争政策（以及包括贸易在内的其他领域）的驱动逻辑。对垄断权力如何影响工人、小镇企业甚至民主本身的担忧被排除在分析之外。例如，奥巴马政府<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/horizontal-merger-guidelines-08192010">2010 年的指导方针</a>免除了更多合并的审查，并赞扬公司交易“具有显着提高效率的潜力，从而增强合并后公司的竞争能力和激励”。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/biden-domestic-industrial-investment-chips-act/674529/">乔尔·道奇：我的家乡正在接受价值 1000 亿美元的拜登经济学</a><br><br>拜登政府最被忽视的特征之一是它愿意挑战效率崇拜。合并指导方针是迄今为止最正面的攻击。在拜登的反垄断官员看来，华盛顿对效率的转向——这个词没有出现在任何反垄断法规中——用自由主义经济学教授的偏好取代了国会实际通过的法律。新的指导方针试图扭转这一局面。他们并不拒绝经济分析。但他们的指导理论是，即使计量经济学模型承诺某种效率增益，也应该阻止企业获得导致滥用的权力。<br><br>如果新标准追溯适用，近期记忆中一些最引人注目的合并可能不会被允许发生，至少不会没有一场斗争。想想埃克森美孚和美孚、联合航空和大陆航空、亚马逊和全食超市等等。较小的交易也可能受到挑战，因为新指导方针认识到，随着时间的推移，大量的小规模合并可能会积累起来形成垄断力量。 Facebook 可能会被拒绝收购虚拟现实公司 Oculus。谷歌可能不被允许进军数字广告市场。<br><br>也许新方法最明显的例子是指导方针坚持要求政府审查合并可能如何伤害工人，而不仅仅是消费者。这是建立在司法部<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/penguin-random-house-amazon-doj/671973/">成功阻止企鹅兰登书屋收购西蒙与舒斯特的诉讼</a>之上的。在这种情况下，政府辩称，这笔交易会给作者带来较小的进步，因为更少的出版公司将竞争他们的才能。这对作家的影响比行业整合可能带来的任何预期效率更为重要。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">在</span>两极分化的<span class="smallcaps">时代</span>，每个政党都学会了充分利用行政部门的权力。由于无法利用分裂严重的国会来实现其目标，政府只能依靠更加脆弱的法令权力。事实上，里根派通过<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.promarket.org/2022/04/28/a-richard-posner-and-george-stigler-memo-throttling-back-on-antitrust-a-practical-proposal-for-deregulation/">政府备忘录</a>帮助开创了革命策略。他们将合并指导方针视为无需任何实际立法即可改变法律的一种方式。正如一位相关观察家当时<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/3480166">所说</a>，“在规范自由裁量权的幌子下，反垄断法正在未经国会行动的情况下进行修改。”<br><br>这种方法的缺陷是显而易见的：任何行政行动都可以被下一届政府撤销。但如果构思巧妙，官僚政策也有可能坚持下去。他们不仅能够克服法律挑战，还能融入公务员文化。就合并指导方针而言，人们进一步希望共和党的民粹主义派系出于对大型科技力量的共同担忧而接受该政策。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/tech-giants-are-dangerous-and-congress-knows-it/614740/">富兰克林·福尔：科技巨头很危险，国会知道这一点</a><br><br>拜登合并指导方针的制定是为了维持未来驱逐它们的尝试。尽管他们的意图很激进，但他们却表现出对司法先例的温和解释。每一项新政策都是对现有法律的忠实表达，并附有充分的脚注。隐含的论点是，反垄断纪律已被芝加哥经济学院的市场原教旨主义者从内部侵蚀、捕获和扭曲。这些指导方针本身只是对最初构思和编写的法律的回归。<br><br>这个策略会奏效吗？顾名思义，该指南不具有法律效力。最终，合并挑战的命运通常由联邦法官决定。就在上周，联邦贸易委员会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/e94b9d46-ae94-4563-b09c-0032a9e7530d">未能</a>阻止微软完成对视频游戏开发商动视暴雪 690 亿美元的交易。做出对该机构不利裁决的联邦法官是拜登任命的。<br><br>批评者还会认为新框架脱离了经济现实，并警告称这将导致价格上涨。事实上，以效率为中心的反垄断似乎在其自身条件下失败了：迄今为止的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/9780262536776/mergers-merger-control-and-remedies/">主要分析</a>发现，合并更有可能提高消费者价格，而不是降低消费者价格。但在某种程度上，关注价格影响是没有抓住重点的。效率是评估合并的最冷指标。它将美国人贬低为被称为“消费者”的程式化经济漫画，将廉价商品视为我们最高也是唯一的愿望。新的指导方针为微积分注入了一些人性。他们认为，政府的最终问题不应该是某件事是否有效，而应该是它是否正确。<br><br></div>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>保罗·斯佩拉/《大西洋月刊》插图。资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure>没有<span class="smallcaps">一种饮料</span>可以永远保持气泡状态。自 2001 年以来，百威淡啤 (Bud Light) 一直是美国最畅销的啤酒，但它的霸主地位似乎终于要结束了。麻烦始于四月，当时该品牌公布了与变性影响者迪伦·马尔瓦尼(Dylan Mulvaney)的赞助协议，引发了大规模的反变性强烈抵制。 Kid Rock <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/culture/pride/kid-rock-shoots-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney-campaign-1235298048/">拍摄了自己</a>用步枪炸开百威淡啤的过程。抵制活动迅速蔓延。根据市场研究公司 NielsenIQ 的数据，到 6 月，墨西哥啤酒 Modelo Especial 已经<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/modelo-tops-bud-light-top-selling-beer-us-may-rcna89350">占据</a>零售额榜首的位置。至少从一项衡量标准来看，百威淡啤正式不再是美国最受欢迎的啤酒。<br><br>抵制活动的成功令人震惊。百威淡啤长期以来一直很受欢迎，以至于它的突然衰落似乎是不可想象的。然而事实是，它的主导地位从来没有看上去那么稳固，抵制只是加速了现有的趋势。美国对啤酒的口味不再统一。该国有超过 9,500 家精酿啤酒厂生产美味的 IPA 和果味酸啤酒（淡啤酒的对立面），而啤酒面临着来自鸡尾酒、葡萄酒、烈酒和苏打水的日益激烈的竞争。如今，喝淡啤酒已不再是人们的默认饮酒习惯。即使是这样，也没有任何自然法则要求美国人更喜欢百威淡啤而不是同样温和的竞争对手。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/bud-light-boycott-consumer-effect/674446/">詹姆斯·苏罗维茨基 (James Surowiecki)：抵制百威淡啤的痛苦真相</a><br><br>“我们拥有该国历史上最多样化的饮酒者群体，他们可以从有史以来最多样化的酒精饮料品牌中进行选择，”酒精饮料时事通讯<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.goodbeerhunting.com/sightlines">Sightlines</a>的编辑布莱恩·罗斯 (Bryan Roth) 说道。如果百威淡啤对人们没有吸引力，他们“很容易找到能吸引人的东西”。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">人类发酵啤酒已有</span>数千年历史，但美国淡啤酒的历史只能追溯到 20 世纪 40 年代初，当时 Coors 啤酒公司推出了 Coors Light。然而，由于第二次世界大战粮食短缺，该品牌很快就停产了。淡啤酒的真正故事始于 20 世纪 60 年代，当时布鲁克林的 Rheingold 啤酒厂采用瑞士化学家 Hersch Gablinger 发明的工艺开发了一种低热量、零碳水化合物的啤酒。他们将其命名为加布林格啤酒。<br><br> Rheingold 于 1967 年推出了 Gablinger&#39;s，将其定位为适合注重卡路里的女性的减肥饮料。它失败了。随后，Rheingold 的内部生物化学家 Joseph L. Owades 与芝加哥的 Meister Bräu 分享了配方，从而将其变成了“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://farm5.static.flickr.com/4100/4818642458_dc8a10e425_z.jpg">活力十足、强度十足</a>”的 Meister Bräu Lite。 1972 年 Meister Bräu 破产后，Miller Brewing 收购了该品牌，重新配制，并将其重新推出为 96 卡路里的 Miller Lite。这将是第一款真正面向大众市场的美国淡啤酒。<br><br>百威母公司安海斯-布希公司的高管对此表示怀疑。 “我们认为我们的啤酒足够清淡，”该公司酿酒副总裁当时表示。 （2008年，安海斯-布希公司与比利时英博集团合并，成立安海斯-布希英博公司，成为世界上最大的啤酒生产商。）<i> </i>他们很快就被证明是错误的。米勒似乎是第一家发现淡味啤酒的成功与其说是如何酿造，不如说是如何营销的公司。 1975 年，米勒淡啤 (Miller Lite) 凭借一场广告攻势席卷全国，其中职业运动员向男士推销一款口味极佳、口感较淡的啤酒。传达的信息是：男人也可以喝淡啤酒！有效。 Miller Lite 成为热门产品，第一年全年出货量达 500 万桶。其他公司被迫做出回应。库尔斯 (Coors) 重新推出了 Coors Light，安海斯布希 (Anheuser-Busch) 分别于 1977 年和 1978 年推出了 Natural Light 和 Michelob Light。但该公司不愿推出美国最畅销啤酒百威啤酒的淡味版。<br><br> “他们不想让自己的公司就此搁置，”安海斯-布希王朝历史<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/bitter-brew-pb-william-knoedelseder/9780062009272?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>《苦酒》</i></a>一书的作者威廉·诺德尔塞德 (William Knoedelseder) 说道。董事长 August A. Busch III（创始人阿道夫·布希 (Adolphus Busch) 的曾孙）将百威啤酒视为公司的“至高无上的荣耀”和家族的遗产。 “任何带有百威啤酒名字的产品都不会失败。”<br><br>然而，到了 1981 年，随着 Miller Lite 销量的加速增长，压力变得难以抗拒。布希需要把赌注押在他的领头马身上。他委托制作了一种他称之为百威淡味啤酒的配方。 “他在这款产品上投入了一个世纪以来的品牌忠诚度，”Knoedelseder 说道。根据董事长的标准，对配方进行了修改以减少苦味后，该公司于 1982 年推出了百威淡味啤酒，并在体育赛事期间播放了克莱兹代尔马奔腾的广告。百威淡啤（Bud Light）（后来被命名）在年轻和中年专业人士中畅销，但销量仍然落后于美乐淡啤（Miller Lite）。<br><br>超级碗广告改变了一切。 1987 年，安海斯-布希 (Anheuser-Busch) 在一场大型比赛中为年轻男性饮酒者设计了一个 30 秒的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T18XOQppkkY">节目</a>，主角是一只名叫 Spuds MacKenzie 的斗牛犬——“百威淡啤最初的派对动物！”马铃薯引起了流行文化的轰动，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0K5BgCI-U7c">戴着墨镜玩滑板</a>，吸引了衣着暴露的女性渴望的目光。 “他是 Spuds MacKenzie，”后来一则广告的旁白惊呼道：“一个热爱派对、充满活力的家伙！” （别介意<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/56228/life-death-and-resurrection-spuds-mackenzie-original-party-animal">扮演 Spuds 的狗</a>是母狗。）Spuds 逐渐体现了爱玩的兄弟会男孩的形象，这使百威淡啤有别于更古板的百威啤酒品牌。<br><br>这些引人注目的广告帮助百威淡啤第一年的销售额增长了 21%。到 1994 年底，百威淡啤 (Bud Light) 已超过米勒淡啤 (Miller Lite)，成为美国最畅销的淡色啤酒，并且在所有啤酒中仅次于百威啤酒 (Budweiser)，这意味着安海斯布希 (Anheuser-Busch) 占据了前两名的位置。七年后，即 2001 年，百威淡啤 (Bud Light) 超越百威啤酒 (Budweiser)，成为美国最畅销的啤酒：杂货店和酒吧的主打啤酒、棒球场随处可见的啤酒、大学派对和车尾聚会上的入门级啤酒。<br><br>但淡啤酒市场从来都不是垄断的。如果您决定放弃百威淡啤，那么改用库尔斯淡啤或美乐淡啤之类的啤酒相对容易一些。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://beernet.com/"><i>《啤酒商业日报》</i></a>出版人哈利·舒马赫 (Harry Schuhmacher) 表示，饮酒者认为这些品牌是“可以互换的”：“它们的价格相同，味道也相同。”重要的是顾客对品牌的感受。在强大的营销和忠诚的西班牙裔客户群的推动下，进口商 Constellation Brands 为 Modelo Especial 培养了广泛的追随者。 Michelob Ultra 的销量在最近的扫描数据中略高于百威淡啤（该品牌也属于百威英博旗下），它的定位是一款淡啤酒，适合活跃、注重健康的饮酒者在有氧运动或打完 18 洞高尔夫球后享用。<br><br> “他们永远无法恢复原来的销量，”饮料时事通讯<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fingers.email/about">《Fingers》</a>的出版者戴夫·因方特 (Dave Infante) 说道。百威淡啤的销量在 2008 年<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://adage.com/article/marketing-news-strategy/bud-light-ad-agency-search-ab-inbev-beer-marketing-strategy-and-history/2421881">达到</a>峰值 4240 万桶，到 2020 年已<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brewbound.com/news/beer-marketers-insights-50-years-in-beer-volume-flattens-suppliers-grow-brands-shrink/">下降</a>至 2570 万桶。即使在抵制之前，“它永远不会成为该国最畅销的啤酒。”<br><br> “当我接手百威淡啤时，我有一个非常明确的工作要做，那就是，‘这个品牌正在衰落，它已经衰落了很长一段时间，如果我们不吸引年轻饮酒者来喝这个品牌，百威淡啤就没有未来，’”百威淡啤营销副总裁 Alissa Heinerscheid 在三月份的<i>Make Yourself at Home</i>播客中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ninesliving.com/make-yourself-at-home-podcast-alissa-heinerscheid-bud-light/">说道</a>。一个月后，海纳沙伊德<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/24/business/anheuser-execs-on-leave/index.html">被</a>休假，因为公司试图控制反马尔瓦尼抵制活动的影响。对于一个通过鼓励年轻人将自己想象成名副其实的猛犬而建立帝国的品牌来说，她为摆脱公司兄弟会男孩形象所做的努力可能过于艰巨。<br><br>不过，<span class="smallcaps">我们不要得意忘形</span>。正如百威淡啤看似不可动摇的统治地位被夸大了一样，它陷入死亡螺旋的想法也被夸大了。对啤酒的躁动并不是什么新鲜事。 “啤酒酿造业持续了许多类似的消费者运动，部分原因是啤酒在美国人的生活中无处不在，而且很容易辨认，” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/brewing-a-boycott-how-a-grassroots-coalition-fought-coors-and-remade-american-consumer-activism-allyson-p-brantley/9781469661032?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>《酿造抵制》一</i></a>书的作者艾莉森·P·布兰特利 (Allyson P. Brantley) 说<i>。</i> 1966 年，两个总部位于丹佛的西班牙裔团体发起抵制库尔斯啤酒公司 (Coors Brewing Company) 的活动，抗议其对待墨西哥裔美国工人的方式；一直<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cpr.org/2014/10/03/the-coors-boycott-when-a-beer-can-signaled-your-politics/">持续到1987年</a>。 1982 年，杰西·杰克逊 (Jesse Jackson) 领导了一场<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/09/07/us/around-the-nation-boycott-of-busch-beers-sought-by-jesse-jackson.html">针对安海斯-布希 (Anheuser-Busch) 的抵制活动</a>，以抗议该公司缺乏黑人拥有的经销商。还记得那些争议吗？可能不会。 “美国人往往对抵制活动没有很好的持久记忆，”布兰特利说。<br><br>库尔斯通过创建隐藏企业联系的子品牌来应对这种强烈反对，例如 Killian&#39;s Irish Red 和 Zima。 （合并后，库尔斯现在是 Molson Coors Beverage Company 的一部分，该公司是一家巨头，还拥有 Miller。）“当你站在啤酒过道上时，你必须是一个真正知识渊博的消费者，才能知道这些不同产品的来源，”布兰特利说。这种动态似乎肯定会削弱最新抵制活动对百威英博利润的影响。在美国，该集团<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.anheuser-busch.com/brands">提供</a>100 多个品牌，其中不仅包括 Michelob Ultra 和 Busch Light，还包括 Stella Artois 和 Hoegaarden 等品牌，以及 Goose Island 等曾经独立的精酿啤酒厂。德克萨斯州共和党众议员丹·克伦肖 (Dan Crenshaw) 试图通过<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/dan-crenshaw-bud-light-boycott-17888792.php">展示</a>冰箱里装满来自安海斯-布希英博 (Anheuser-Busch InBev) 旗下休斯顿啤酒厂卡尔巴赫 (Karbach) 的啤酒来蔑视百威淡啤 (Bud Light)。这些钱都存入同一个银行账户。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/01/craft-beer-industry/550850/">阅读：精酿啤酒是美国最奇怪、最幸福的经济故事</a><br><br>即使是百威淡啤新获得的第二名也需要更多背景信息。报告的数据不包括酒吧、餐馆和其他场所的生啤酒销量，在这些场所，您更有可能找到百威淡啤，而不是 Modelo Especial。 Sightlines 的罗斯表示，从销量来看，百威淡啤“仍然是今年迄今为止排名第一的啤酒”。<br><br>但口味会变。 Schlitz 曾经是美国<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://beerconnoisseur.com/articles/schlitz-how-milwaukees-famous-beer-became-infamous">最畅销的啤酒</a>，最初的百威啤酒于 2001 年结束。Bud Light 作为一个带来派对的欢乐品牌而声名鹊起：<i>我们的啤酒很有趣！喝很多吧！</i>今天的饮酒者往往有更复杂的自我概念。他们还有更多的选择和意见。啤酒存在于一个难以驾驭的世界，任何东西都可以成为文化战争的弹药，无论是迪士尼电影还是塔吉特百货的服装。没有哪个啤酒品牌会再次占据如此主导地位。很难完全了解自己的感受。百威淡啤 (Bud Light) 的设计风格平淡且具有广泛的吸引力，但它几乎不是什么民族自豪感。然而，饮料市场的分裂代表着共同文化的某种丧失。这有点苦乐参半。不过，只是一点点。一点也不苦。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

要求你做的就是“简单地相信”。<br><br>如果这种心理方法失败了，还可以使用臭氧疗法。<br><br> Noom 和节食巨头慧俪轻体 (WeightWatchers) 最近都增加了服务，让他们的客户能够获得 Ozempic 和其他重磅新 GLP-1 减肥药，例如 Wegovy 和 Mounjaro。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-25/weight-loss-startup-noom-is-getting-into-the-ozempic-business?sref=BGQFqz7X">今年春天</a>，Noom 推出了 Noom Med，将其行为改变计划与各种减肥药物（其中包括 GLP-1）的处方结合起来。 Noom Med 将把用户与开药的医生联系起来，尽管它不会支付他们每月经常支付的巨额费用。慧俪轻体 (WeightWatchers) 最近收购了肥胖药物在线提供商<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.joinsequence.com/program/our-program">Sequence</a> 。注册的人可以获得免费的慧俪轻体 (WeightWatchers) 会员资格。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/02/intuitive-eating/583357/">阅读：最新的饮食趋势不是节食</a><br><br>此举标志着饮食行业的最新重塑——承认对某些人来说，快乐的运动永远不够，计算卡路里是不够的，而像 Ozempic 这样的药物可以成为实现良好健康的重要工具。<br><br>这也反映了饮食世界尴尬而持久的现实：许多肥胖者<i>确实</i>想减肥，但想要变得苗条的愿望却变得有点粗俗。我们应该爱自己的身体，即使我们拼尽全力去重塑它。康奈尔大学饮食行业历史学家艾德丽安·比塔尔认为，这一转变表明，尽管减肥界时不时地涉足“健康”等模糊概念，但“归根结底，大多数人只是真的想减肥。”为什么不让他们呢？<br><br>美国人的节食习惯是溜溜球式的，但我们与节食也有着溜溜球式的关系。在过去一个世纪左右的时间里，减肥行业在道德说教、羞辱和不温不火的身体积极性之间徘徊，这取决于时代的情绪。早期的饮食改革者，比如与饼干同名的西尔维斯特·格雷厄姆（Sylvester Graham）认为，吃得更好确实可以使一个人变得更好、更有道德。格雷厄姆和其他人认为，暴食会导致暴力和手淫等罪恶，正如苏珊·雅格在她的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Hundred-Year-Diet-Americas-Voracious/dp/1605290114"><i>《百年饮食》</i></a>一书中所描述的那样。格雷厄姆建议：“像对待一个受到良好照顾的孩子一样对待你的胃。”<br><br>第一次世界大战期间，少吃被认为是爱国行为，是为海外作战的美国军队释放宝贵热量资源的一种方式。后来，医生和心理学家得出了（错误的）结论：超重的人很懒，用早期饮食书籍作者露露·亨特·彼得斯（Lulu Hunt Peters）的话说，社会认为体重过重是一种“耻辱”。节食组织无情地羞辱人们减肥。 20世纪50年代初，一个这样的“支持”团体举行公开称重，并强迫体重增加的成员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://responsejournal.net/issue/2020-12/article/reducing-betty-food-suppression-appetites">站成“猪队”，</a>他们会唱一首歌词，其中包括“我们是吃得太多的胖乎乎的小猪，胖，胖，胖”。<br><br>慧俪轻体 (WeightWatchers) 始于 20 世纪 60 年代，当时一位名叫 Jean Nidetch 的家庭主妇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/30/business/jean-nidetch-dies-at-91-co-founder-of-weight-watchers-and-dynamic-speaker.html?searchResultPosition=17">邀请六位朋友</a>到她家谈论她们的体重斗争。 Nidetch 最终减掉了 72 磅，她将团体支持作为她新计划的支柱。尽管如此，她仍然专注于慧俪轻体的“体重”部分，敦促会员携带以前较重的自己的照片。耶格尔引用她的话：“我祈祷我永远不会忘记我来自哪里。”<br><br>但近年来，节食已经走上了Livestrong手环的道路。杂志<a data-event-element="inline link"

放弃了字面上的“体重”，并将自己更名为 WW，新的重点是“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/weight-watchers-changes-name-as-it-shifts-mission-1537807754">健康</a>”。该公司不再要求会员制定<a

表示</a>，“世界不需要另一种饮食”，“健康就是新的瘦身”。<br><br>即便如此，慧俪轻体和其他节食计划通过改变行为来发挥作用，其目标无论是口头还是其他方式都是减肥。 （该公司现在使用这两个名称。）Noom 非常关注心理学；该应用程序包含许多关于压力触发因素、盲目饮食和“行为链”的文章。 “你不是你的想法，而是你想法的观察者，”该应用程序曾告诉我。然而，它也鼓励用户每天称重，记录他们的食物，并坚持每日卡路里目标。即使不再强调“体重”，WeightWatchers 仍然提供<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.weightwatchers.com/nz/wellbeing/evolution-of-ww">锻炼计划</a>和跟踪食物营养价值的“积分”系统。会议被重新命名为“ <a data-event-element="inline link"

GLP-1，您<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/21/well/eat/ozempic-food-noise.html">就不会那么想</a>无意识饮食。 GLP-1 药物 Mounjaro 可以帮助人们减轻<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/06/06/ozempic-weight-loss-ruth-marcus/">22.5%</a>的体重，接近减肥手术减轻的体重。 （相对于手术，人们绝大多数更喜欢药物治疗。）在 Wegovy 中，这一比例为 15%——对于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html">42%</a>的肥胖美国人来说，这仍然是一个改变生活的数字。与节食和运动相比，根据国家体重与健康中心主任斯科特·卡汉的说法，节食和运动通常导致的体重减轻不到 5%，如果加上像 Noom 这样的指导计划，则可以达到 7%。有些人的身体会粘着多余的脂肪；有些人的身体会粘着多余的脂肪。<a

href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34453886/">研究表明</a>，当肥胖者开始剧烈运动计划时，他们的静息代谢率<i>会下降</i>，从而使减肥变得更加困难。肥胖者经常尝试一切方法，“然后这些药物就出现了……就像，努力吧，伙计，”芝加哥洛约拉大学副教授、该研究的作者之一劳拉·杜加斯告诉我。 “你接受这个帮助。”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/ozempic-pills-obesity-drugs-semaglutide/674541/">阅读：再见，臭氧</a><br><br>这些药物的出现引发了一个问题：肥胖者疯狂地节食和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/exercise-body-positivity-jonah-hill-stutz-ozempic/673524/">锻炼</a>是否有任何意义？ “行为减肥方法几年来一直面临压力，”克雷格-哈勒姆资本集团 (Craig-Hallum Capital Group) 的分析师亚历克斯·福尔曼 (Alex Fuhrman) 表示，他负责体重观察者 (WeightWatchers) 的研究。这些公司看到了 Ozempic 的兴起，希望“自己也能参与竞争”。<br><br>慧俪轻体和 Noom 似乎都承认，仅靠节食和锻炼——他们最近的计划的支柱——对某些人来说是行不通的。这些组织的高管告诉我，他们将肥胖视为一种慢性疾病，有时需要持续的药物治疗。 “早在 60 年代和 70 年代，我们的想法就是人们很坏；他们吃得太多了。他们不锻炼，就会变得肥胖，然后其他一切都变得一团糟，”Noom 的首席医疗官琳达·阿内加瓦 (Linda Anegawa) 告诉我。 “我们现在了解到，实际上，某些人在遗传上容易产生胰岛素抵抗。”这可能会导致脂肪储存异常和食欲失调——GLP-1 可以对此有所帮助。<br><br>对于慧俪轻体首席执行官西马·西斯塔尼（Sima Sistani）来说，这些药物可能是那些无法通过该计划减肥或体重不断反弹的肥胖者的解决方案。 “有些人加入了这个计划，但因为它对他们不起作用而退出了我们的计划，”西斯塔尼告诉我。 “我们必须诚实地面对这一点。现在我们知道得更多了。所以我们应该做得更好。”<br><br>要通过 Noom Med 或 Sequence 获得 GLP-1 资格，一个人必须肥胖、BMI 高于 30，或超重且患有符合资格的健康状况（例如糖尿病）。医生会对顾客进行筛查，以确保他们符合标准。 Sequence 的费用为每月 99 美元，Noom Med 的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2023-05-25/weight-loss-startup-noom-is-getting-into-the-ozempic-business?sref=BGQFqz7X">费用约为 120 美元</a>，但这两种费用均不包括药物费用，如果没有保险，每月费用可能高达 1,000 美元。<br><br>令我惊讶的是，减肥医生告诉我，节食应用程序和注射药物的结合可能是一件好事。卡汉警告说，这些药物对很多人来说效果不佳。但像 Noom Med 这样的服务可能会帮助生活在偏远地区或无法联系到专家的肥胖者。 “我们已经增加了肥胖医学医生的队伍，但大多数美国人仍然无法获得一位医生，”他说。 “如果做得好，这些虚拟护理项目可能会非常有价值。”<br><br>尽管 Ozempic 和 Wegovy 等药物可以帮助人们感到更饱并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/21/well/eat/ozempic-food-noise.html">减少对食物的思考</a>，但服用这些药物的人确实必须消耗更少的卡路里才能减肥。这就是 Noom 或 WeightWatchers 等程序可以发挥作用的地方。像 Noom 应用程序这样的应用程序，其中包括关于哪些食物最健康的测验（葡萄还是葡萄干？是葡萄），可能会让服用 GLP-1 的人永久保持较低的体重。减肥药物<i>和</i>更健康的习惯相结合可以实现最显着的减肥效果。毕竟，大幅减肥是许多人的目标。<br><br>有一次，西斯塔尼使用了<i>“体重健康”</i>这个词，我问她“健康是新的瘦身”是否仍然是公司的精神。 “我认为<i>饮食</i>这个词和<i>饮食文化</i>以及它的错误之处在于对瘦的关注，”西斯塔尼说。她告诉我，她很欣赏身体积极性的概念。但她似乎也清楚肥胖的缺点：例如，肥胖会缩短<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://irp.nih.gov/blog/post/2020/01/extreme-obesity-shaves-years-off-life-expectancy">人的寿命</a>，并增加<a data-event-element="inline link"

“在这个框架内仍然有机会谈论幸福以及<i>我如何生活？我如何实现长寿？我怎样才能拥有坚强、健康的生活？</i>你的体重将成为其中的一部分。”<br><br>溜溜球又回来了，我们承认节食者不想道德、爱国或感到羞耻。他们只是想减肥。这种愿望始终是价值中立的。但现在它更容易实现。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 21 Jul 2023

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://projects.propublica.org/climate-migration/">ProPublica 的</a>一项分析认为，拉莫伊尔是整个美国最能免受气候变化综合影响（包括海平面上升、野火、农作物受损和经济影响）影响的县。但那是在洪水之前。<br><br>本月早些时候，县中心附近的莫里斯维尔<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/11/us/vermont-ny-rainfall-totals-floods.html">降雨量为 5 至 10 英寸</a>。附近沃尔科特的道路被毁。拉莫伊尔河的洪水在剑桥周围盘旋，三十人被疏散。农作物全部被毁，主要道路无法通行。佛蒙特州公共安全专员詹妮弗·莫里森称拉莫伊尔县是该州“受灾最严重的地区”。<br><br>七月的洪水只是佛蒙特州今年一系列极端天气事件中最新的一起。在经历了<a data-event-element="inline link"

月 10 日这一周，暴雨淹没了州首府蒙彼利埃，冲毁了全州的房屋和企业。这是自飓风艾琳以来最严重的洪水，艾琳飓风是 12 年前袭击的“100 年”风暴。<br><br>佛蒙特州不再是许多人认为的避风港。如果这个充满田园风光的小州不安全，又远离海洋，而且是该国最凉爽的地区之一，那么很难想象还有哪个地方是安全的。<br><br>学术界长期以来一直对确定“气候避难所”感兴趣，即随着全球气温持续攀升，这些地区不太可能遭受极端高温、海平面上升和内陆洪水的影响，并且可能有能力容纳气候难民。佛蒙特州的城镇经常出现在这些名单上。其中一份由杜兰大学房地产教授杰西·基南去年编制，

年一遇的风暴；未来几十年，阿什维尔预计将容易出现干旱、极端高温和极端降水。如果所谓的避难所的情况看起来如此糟糕，那么我们就急需觉醒了。<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/05/16/nicholas-adams-vermont-faces-a-looming-climate-refugee-crisis/">调查</a>发现，佛蒙特州三分之一的新居民因气候相关原因搬到这里。我的朋友乔·迪克森就是其中之一。他和他的丈夫曾经在德克萨斯州巴斯特罗普县拥有一个农场，该地区每年都会发生更多的野火和山洪。 2017 年，飓风哈维冲毁了一座桥梁，使他们的社区陷入困境。仅一年前，他们搬到了佛蒙特州的秘鲁。乔告诉我，上周洪水过后，他感到一种“深深而焦虑的警惕”——尽管他的房子位于高地，但他还是彻夜不眠地查看天气预报。就像在德克萨斯州的暴风雨期间，他每隔一两个小时就会醒来，出去检查雨量计，看看小溪，等待水溢出的那一刻。<br><br>长期居住在佛蒙特州的人也同样对洪水感到震惊。周六，我在我们当地的有机农场遇到了我的朋友布拉德·皮科克（Brad Peacock），他已经在沙夫茨伯里生活了几十年。 “我不认为我是唯一一个认为佛蒙特州为应对气候变化做好了更好准备的农民，”他告诉我。我们习惯了生活在一个崇尚自然、气候政策先进的北方州。我们预计不会像飓风艾琳期间以及上周那样措手不及。<br><br> <a

在朋友的婚礼上在雨中跳舞，我抱着她还在襁褓中的妹妹。我们不知道很快整个城镇就会因高速公路被冲毁而与世界隔绝。但上周的风暴有所不同。我的两个女儿现在分别是 14 岁和 12 岁，她们的手机收到了洪水警报；他们的朋友发送了水冲过他们房子的视频。最初的降雨过后，我们沿着 7A 号公路向北行驶，调查受损情况。我们的轮胎溅过高速公路上几英寸深的积水。地下室的物品被倾倒到前院进行紧急保管。当地的公园和果岭完全被淹没，巴滕基尔河——通常是清澈的——被径流变成棕色，河水如此之高，在下面咆哮时舔着当地的一座桥梁。<br><br>回到家后，我们的集体情绪都很低落。 “我能感觉到自己在期待一些不好的事情发生，”弗雷泽告诉我。后来，当我们在客厅沙发上观看洪水的新闻片段时，Zephyr 感到忧郁。 “我感到害怕，因为我必须在一个被毁的佛蒙特州长大，”她说。<br><br>与其他美国农村人一样，佛蒙特州人往往与周围的土地有着深厚的联系。我的农民朋友布拉德为田地被洪水淹没的当地人感到悲痛。他在给我的信中写道，有些人“可能永远无法回到他们如此精心照料的土地，这确实伤害了我的心”。 “我知道与土地相连是什么感觉，一想到它眨眼间就被夺走，我就心碎。”<br><br>在全国各地，在气候避风港和已知的风险地区，家庭都害怕失去与家乡的联系。佐治亚州的农民正在<a data-event-element="inline link"

86 岁，是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-richard-rhodes/9781451677614?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《原子弹的制造》</em></a>一书的作者，这本书荣获普利策奖，已成为某些类型的人工智能研究人员（即那些相信自己的创造物可能有能力杀死我们所有人的人）的圣书。周五下午，他将坐在西西雅图一家剧院的座位上，像许多其他电影观众一样，观看克里斯托弗·诺兰关于曼哈顿计划的夏季大片<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/"><em>《奥本海默》</em></a> 。 （这部电影不是根据他的书改编的，尽管他怀疑他的文字可以作为研究辅助工具；无论如何，他很高兴看到它。）<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/">阅读：<em>奥本海默</em>不仅仅是关于原子弹的创造神话</a><br><br>我第一次接触<em>《原子弹的制造》</em>是在三月份，当时我与一位人工智能研究人员交谈，他说他每天都会推着这本门挡大小的书到处走。 （他解释说，这提醒人们，他的使命是推动技术进步，也是每天工作 17 小时的激励工具。）从那时起，我就听到<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/21/podcasts/ezra-klein-podcast-transcript-kelsey-piper.html">播客</a>上提到这本书，并在我与那些担心人工智能会毁灭我们所有人的人的对话中引用了这本书。 <em>Vox</em>的迪伦·马修斯 (Dylan Matthews) 最近<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/6/29/23762219/ai-artificial-intelligence-new-nuclear-weapons-future">写道</a>：“我认识很多从事人工智能政策工作的人，他们一直在阅读罗德的书来获取灵感。” 《<em>纽约时报》</em>对人工智能公司 Anthropic 的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/technology/anthropic-ai-claude-chatbot.html">介绍</a>指出，罗德斯的书“在公司员工中很受欢迎”，其中一些人“将自己与现代的罗伯特·奥本海默进行比较”。<br><br>就像之前的奥本海默一样， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt.html">许多人工智能商人</a>相信他们的创造可能会改变历史进程，因此他们与深刻的道德问题作斗争。即使他们在开发技术的同时，也担心如果<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/ai-threat-warning.html">人工智能变得比人类更聪明</a>并变得失控，会发生什么，随着生成人工智能模型吸收<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/">大量信息</a>并显得越来越有能力，这种推测的可能性已经演变成一种不可动摇的神经症。 40 多年前，罗德斯开始对人类历史上最重要的成就之一进行权威的阐述。今天，它就像一本使用说明书一样被仔细审查。<br><br>罗兹本人并不是一个末日论者，但他了解 20 世纪 40 年代洛斯阿拉莫斯的工作与当今硅谷所发生的事情之间的相似之处。 “奥本海默多次谈到原子弹既是危险又是希望，”罗德告诉我——它可以结束战争，同时威胁到终结人类。他曾 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/richard-rhodes#details">表示</a>，人工智能可能像核能一样具有变革性，并饶有兴趣地关注着硅谷最大的公司为构建和部署人工智能而展开的疯狂竞争。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">阅读：人工智能厄运论是一个诱饵</a><br><br>毫无疑问，人工智能的支持者和建设者会对罗兹在其书 25 周年纪念版的前言中提出的一个论点感到安慰，即核裂变的发现以及原子弹的发现是不可避免的。 “要阻止它，你就必须停止物理学，”他写道。这一论点与乐观的人工智能公司<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/29/us-china-chip-export-restrictions-ai-race">和政府</a>的言论相呼应，他们将这项技术视为全球信息军备竞赛的一部分。按照逻辑，民主国家不能停下来或等待法律出台，以免我们输给中国或其他一些敌对势力。<br><br>这个想法有助于解释为什么技术专家会构建一个人工智能系统，即使他们相信它可以消灭人类的生命—— <em>《原子弹的制造》</em>第一部分中的铭文也是如此。罗德在这里引用了奥本海默的话：“科学中深奥的东西不是因为有用而被发现的，这是一个深刻而必然的真理；而是因为它们有用。”他们被发现是因为有可能找到他们。”<br><br>作为一名技术作家，我职业生涯的大部分时间都在与那些拥有建设冲动的人打交道，无论后果如何。我对人工智能创始人和研究人员的心态感到着迷和困惑，他们说他们对自己正在积极努力创造的事物感到恐惧。我一直在努力使这种性格特征与我自己的倾向相一致：谨慎，对意想不到的后果矩阵的痴迷。我问罗德，这是什么？是什么让人们能够打开潘多拉魔盒？这个问题悬在空中，就在兴登堡号悬空模型的下方，我想象着罗兹在脑海中翻阅着一系列采访和卷角的传记。<br><br>他开始解释。他说，任何伟大的科学家，“在他们 12 岁之前”，都会“有一些形成性的经历，这些经历推动他们走向他们要前进的方向，并让他们决定要经历学习数学或科学的艰苦过程，直到他们能够突破界限。”恩里科·费米（Enrico Fermi）是第一个核反应堆的发明者和原子弹的总设计师，他在青少年时期失去了一位心爱的兄弟，不久之后，他开始痴迷于测量和量化他生活的各个领域。 “他可以告诉你他在街上走了多少步，”罗兹说。 “他看起来非常像一个在数字中找到了他失去兄弟时所失去的那种确定性的人。”罗兹说，十岁时，利奥·西拉德 (Leo Szilard) 因一部关于太阳即将消亡的匈牙利史诗而深感不安，以至于他开始迷恋火箭，以此作为拯救地球的一种方式，这一追求最终使他发现了核链式反应。<br><br> “这么多最终参与炸弹计划的人都是逃离纳粹德国的犹太人，这并非巧合，”他说。 “他们看到了那里发生的事情，他们就在周围，他们知道这很可怕，必须阻止。”罗兹也在自己的作品中看到了童年的阴影，其特点是继母手中的身体虐待和饥饿：“毫不奇怪，我所有的书在某种程度上都是关于人类暴力以及如何处理它的，因为我是这方面的专家。”<br><br>也许这是二元性的另一个教训——在事物的宏伟计划中，我们的噩梦和梦想是一体的。如果说罗德希望人工智能研究人员和创始人从<em>《原子弹的制造》</em>中借鉴一个概念，那就是<em>互补性</em>的概念。这是诺贝尔奖获得者、丹麦物理学家尼尔斯·玻尔的量子物理学思想。据罗兹介绍，玻尔在曼哈顿计划最黑暗的日子里前往洛斯阿拉莫斯向奥本海默传授。用非常基本的术语来说，互补性描述了对象如何具有无法同时观察到的相互冲突的属性。世界包含众多。<br><br>根据罗兹的说法，玻尔从这一观察中发展出了完整的哲学世界观。归根结底，一个可怕的武器可能同时也是一个很棒的工具。 “玻尔的想法给洛斯阿拉莫斯带来了希望，”罗德斯说。 “他告诉关心这种大规模杀伤性武器的物理学家，这个东西将改变战争的现状，从而改变国际政治的整个结构。它要么完全结束战争，要么毁灭世界。前者给了他们希望。”<br><br>在罗兹看来，最重要的教训是，你可能会制造出一种世界末日武器，但事实证明它是不稳定和平的有缺陷的代理人。但反之亦然：旨在让人类永续繁荣的工具可能会带来灾难。因此，对于罗兹来说，对人工智能的真正恐惧只是我们走在一条不确定的道路上，我们进展太快，创建的系统可能违背其预期目的：生产力工具最终会破坏就业机会；合成媒体最终模糊了人造与机器制造、事实与幻觉之间的界限。 “最令人不安的是，社会吸收和适应它的时间太少了，”罗兹在谈到人工智能的崛起时说道。<br><br>在我们离开他的办公室的路上，罗兹停下来给我看了一个胶片盒大小的罐子，里面装着一些看起来像石头的东西。一张褪色的打字标签上写着<span class="smallcaps">“Trinitite”</span> ，这是 1945 年 7 月 Trinity 核弹试验后从新墨西哥州沙漠地面上刮下的残留物的名称。爆炸温度极高，导致沙子变成了玻璃。 “很诡异，不是吗？”罗德笑着说道。我现在很清楚他为什么把这些文物保存得这么近了。 They are the physical manifestation of Bohr&#39;s philosophy and the through line of much of Rhodes&#39;s work—complementarity as interior design. A reminder that the joy and the horror of both the natural world and the one we build for ourselves is the fact that very little behaves as we expect it to. Try as we may, we can&#39;t observe it all simultaneously. It is a reminder of the excitement and terror inherent in the unsolvable mystery that is being alive.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 20:34:22 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/richard-rhodes-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-ai/674777/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/richard-rhodes-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-ai/674777/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Climate Collapse Could Happen Fast]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> As temperature and weather records fall, Earth may be nearing so-called tipping points. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Z44BwZ1j5uw2VlikZWd-fsZC5gk=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/climate_change_speed_horz_illo/original.jpg" alt="秒表的插图，倾斜并看起来像地球仪" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Ben Kothe / The Atlantic.资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure> Ever since some of the earliest projections of climate change were made <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/warming_papers/sawyer.1972.warm2000.pdf">back in the 1970s</a> , they have been remarkably accurate at predicting the rate at which global temperatures would rise. For decades, climate change has proceeded at roughly the expected pace, says David Armstrong McKay, a climate scientist at the University of Exeter, in England. Its impacts, however, are accelerating—sometimes far faster than expected.<br><br> For a while, the consequences weren&#39;t easily seen. They certainly are today.西南地区在热穹下酷热难耐。 Vermont saw a deluge of rain, its second 100-year storm in roughly a decade. Early July brought the hottest day globally since records began—a milestone surpassed again the following day. “For a long time, we were within the range of normal. And now we&#39;re really not,” Allegra LeGrande, a physical-research scientist at Columbia University, told me. “And it has happened fast enough that people have a memory of it happening.”<br><br> In fact, a growing number of climate scientists now believe we may be careening toward so-called tipping points, where incremental steps along the same trajectory could push Earth&#39;s systems into abrupt or irreversible change—leading to transformations that cannot be stopped even if emissions were suddenly halted. “The Earth may have left a &#39;safe&#39; climate state beyond 1°C global warming,” Armstrong McKay and his co-authors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#tab-contributors">concluded</a> in <em>Science</em> last fall. If these thresholds are passed, some of global warming&#39;s effects—like the thaw of permafrost or the loss of the world&#39;s coral reefs—are likely to happen more quickly than expected. On the whole, however, the implications of blowing past these tipping points remain among climate change&#39;s most consequential unknowns: We don&#39;t really know <em>when</em> or <em>how fast</em> things will fall apart.<br><br> Some natural systems, if upended, could herald a restructuring of the world. Take the Thwaites Glacier in West Antarctica: It&#39;s about the size of Florida, with a protruding ice shelf that impedes the glacier&#39;s flow into the ocean. Although the ice shelf&#39;s overall melt is slower than originally predicted, warm water is now eating away at it from below, causing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0">deep cracks</a> . At a certain point, that melt may progress enough to become self-sustaining, which would guarantee the glacier&#39;s eventual collapse. How that plays out will help determine how much sea levels <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1904822116">will rise</a> —and thus the future of millions of people.<br><br> The fate of the Thwaites Glacier could be independent of other tipping points, such as those affecting mountain-glacier loss in South America, or the West African monsoon. But some tipping points will interact, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scientistswarning.forestry.oregonstate.edu/climate_feedbacks">worsening one another&#39;s effects</a> .

The AMOC is like a conveyor belt, drawing warm water from the tropics north. The water&#39;s salinity increases as it evaporates, which, among other factors, makes it sink and return south along the ocean floor. As more glacial fresh water enters the system, that conveyor belt will weaken. Right now it&#39;s the feeblest it&#39;s been in more than 1,000 years.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/ipcc-report-my-climate-tipping-point/619700/">Read: I&#39;ve hit my climate tipping point</a><br><br> A shutdown of that ocean current could dramatically alter phenomena as varied as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/434349-an-urgent-warning-as-a-vital-ocean-current-system-appears-to-show-signs-of-collapsing">global weather patterns</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.exeter.ac.uk/news/homepage/title_772755_en.html">crop yields</a> . Messing with complex systems is chilling precisely because there are so many levers: If the temperature of the sea surface changes, precipitation over the Amazon <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41612-021-00162-1">might too</a> , contributing to its deforestation, which in turn has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41558-022-01558-4">been linked</a> to snowfall on the Tibetan plateau. We may not even realize when we start passing points of no return—or if we already have. “It&#39;s kind of like stepping into a minefield,” Armstrong McKay said. “We don&#39;t want to find out where these things are by triggering them.”<br><br> One <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119">grim paper</a> that came out last year, titled “Climate End Game,” mapped out some of the potential catastrophes that could follow a “tipping cascade,” and considered the possibility that “a sudden shift in climate could trigger systems failures that unravel societies across the globe.” Chris Field, the director of the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment and a contributor to several IPCC reports, warned that “at some point, the impacts of the climate crisis may become so severe that we lose the ability to work together to deliver solutions.”<br><br> James Hansen, one of the early voices on climate, says that measures to mitigate the crisis may now, ironically, be contributing to it. He published a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/Documents/PipelinePaper.2023.05.19.pdf">working paper</a> this spring suggesting that a reduction in sulfate aerosol particles—or the air pollution associated with burning coal and the global shipping industry—has contributed to warmer temperatures. That&#39;s because these particles cause water droplets to multiply, which brightens clouds and reflects solar heat away from the planet&#39;s surface.

There&#39;s a sense of awe—in the original meaning of inspiring terror or dread—at witnessing such sweeping changes play out across the landscape. “Many scientists knew these things would happen, but we&#39;re taken aback by the severity of the major changes we&#39;re seeing,” Ripple said. Armstrong McKay likened the challenge of being a climate scientist in 2023 to that faced by medical professionals: “You put a certain emotional distance between you and the work in order to do the work effectively,” he said, “that can be difficult to maintain.”<br><br> Although it may be too late to avert some changes, others could still be staved off by limiting emissions. LeGrande said she worries that talking about tipping points may encourage people to think that any further action now is futile.

How else would you bid farewell to your virtual comrades after a budget meeting, or a graduate seminar, or a family catch-up? Clicking “Leave meeting” and vanishing seems a little harsh. No—you wave. The elbow is bent sharply to fit it in view of the webcam. The motion is exaggerated, as earnest as a golden retriever. You make eye contact with everyone, which is to say no one. Especially now that remote work is common for white-collar workers, people—myself included—are doing the same corny little gesture in front of countless computer screens across the country, all looking like nerds.<br><br> I needed to know why we American office workers have decided to collectively embarrass ourselves in this specific way, so I asked some experts. Body-language researchers told me that although some people probably Zoom-waved before the pandemic, the gesture really took off in the COVID-lockdown era. In December 2019, Zoom had about 10 million meeting participants daily; by April 2020, that number exceeded <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232401/zoom-300-million-users-growth-coronavirus-pandemic-security-privacy-concerns-response">300 million</a> . Many people weren&#39;t used to this many group video calls, to frozen screens and unmuting and side-chatting, to feeling disembodied and dislocated and isolated. So perhaps in an effort to make it all feel a little more normal, they started doing the wave at the end of meetings. It quickly became “part of the ritual of signing off,” Spencer Kelly, a Colgate University psychologist, neuroscientist, and gesture researcher, told me.<br><br> Today, we&#39;re still in a pandemic, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/remote-work-return-to-office-policies/674736/">plenty of people</a> are still video calling. This month, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WFHResearch_updates_July2023.pdf">one survey</a> found that about 40 percent of American workers were either fully remote or worked on hybrid schedules; in April, more than 800 million different people across the globe used Zoom. And yet, the Zoom wave&#39;s staying power was not inevitable. Instead, it has stuck around maybe not in spite of its awkwardness, but because of it.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">For all their ubiquity</span> , group video calls pose an immense challenge to human communication. In person, we don&#39;t rely solely on words. Humans convey and receive information from highly subtle body language—which is usually lost in a tiny Zoom square. Joe Navarro, a nonverbal-behavior expert and the author of <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/what-every-body-is-saying-an-ex-fbi-agent-s-guide-to-speed-reading-people-joe-navarro/9780061438295?affiliate_id=atl-347">What Every Body Is Saying</a></em> , told me that even the slight arch of an eyebrow can indicate that you like someone; just the faint lift of a finger paired with brief eye contact might stand in for a goodbye. This ambient, largely subconscious exchange of physical signals makes people feel acknowledged and affirmed, however fleetingly. “We reward each other with these little behaviors,” he said.<br><br> Movements can also make people seem more trustworthy. Navarro told me that when people hold their face too still, others don&#39;t tend to like it; even babies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/ed-tronick-and-the-8220-still-face-experiment-8221/">react negatively</a> , for instance, to their caregiver&#39;s motionless face. Gestures and expressions convey valuable information, and when those signals are absent, we might fear danger or rejection. Words can deceive us, after all, and body language can reveal a lot about someone&#39;s true feelings or intentions. And gestures can also signal goodwill, just because someone is putting in effort at all. “The fact that you&#39;re defying gravity and burning blood sugar means you really care,” Navarro said, “and it makes a big difference in how you&#39;re perceived.”<br><br> On Zoom, small motions are harder to pick up on, so people have adapted by making them larger, more stylized, and, perhaps, a bit gauche. I find myself nodding vigorously through entire Zoom meetings, trying to show my attention to the speaker, to the point that my neck literally gets sore. Others have told me they&#39;ve added gestures to their repertoire that they never would use in person: a big, goofy grin to signal mild amusement, or a thumbs-up or a heart shape with their hands to demonstrate appreciation. Some also use the Zoom feature that lets you show an emoji on your screen—say, the clapping hands, or the “party popper” spewing confetti. Emojis and outsize physical gestures really achieve the same end: They are crystal-clear symbols conveying straightforward sentiments, perfect for a setting in which nuance is so easily lost. When you do the Zoom wave, you&#39;re essentially becoming a sentient emoji yourself.<br><br> Highly legible actions with a specific meaning, such as a wave or a thumbs-up, are called “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/06/talk-to-the-hands/309315/">emblem gestures</a> ”; you&#39;re conscious of doing them, unlike “co-speech gestures,” which encompass all the little ways people talk with their hands, usually subconsciously. Many new emblem gestures, Kelly told me, spread by imitation, but it&#39;s unclear why some last longer than others. In a sense, emblem gestures are like words: Once a new one is coined, its meaning can change over time, and eventually it might fade out of use. Some randomness is involved.<br><br> But the researchers I talked with had some theories about what might give a gesture staying power. Susan Wagner Cook, a University of Iowa psychologist, told me that one is more likely to stick if it&#39;s particularly useful. The Zoom wave certainly is; beyond just expressing cordial warmth, it gives us a way to bookend an interaction—to indicate that a meeting is truly done, and to acknowledge other people&#39;s presence before we leave. And Diana R. Sanchez, who leads the Workplace Technology Research Lab at San Francisco State University, pointed out that the Zoom wave is appropriate for people of different levels of closeness. It might be particularly helpful for workplaces, then: It&#39;s sweet but bland, not too intimate or too cheeky.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/05/good-riddance-handshake/611404/">Read: Good riddance to the handshake</a><br><br> A floppy hand wag has also long been used for joining people across a distance. The Zoom wave is obviously an adaptation of the regular wave, which is a common way to call attention to yourself so someone can spot you from far away. You probably wouldn&#39;t wave at someone right next to you, but you&#39;d wave at someone across a room. In a sense, then, it&#39;s fitting for Zoom. Though users can see one another&#39;s faces, they might feel emotionally far from one another—and of course, they usually are physically far too.<br><br> When people wave, they trigger reciprocation. Wagner Cook told me that others tend to have a natural response to wave back—perhaps partly because “mirror neurons” can fire when people observe or perform <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/2/2/114/2736771">communicative hand gestures</a> . And research suggests that when people move in synchrony, they feel more connected. Typically, people are meant to Zoom wave all at once—though in reality it&#39;s rarely perfectly coordinated. The platform is a cornucopia of lagging connections and inadvertent interruptions; it&#39;s practically defined by being out of sync. But Kelly told me that when someone mimics your motions, it goes from satisfying to creepy if the imitation is too obvious or exact. So the messy Zoom wave might actually hit a psychological sweet spot.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/05/awkward-silence-in-conversation-zoom-video-chat/673937/">Read: Embrace the awkward silence</a><br><br> The gesture&#39;s perfect imperfection might explain its ubiquity in a larger sense too. Yes, it has to be unsubtle in order to translate on-screen, but that&#39;s exactly why the Zoom wave is so fitting for this moment. Like a video call itself, it can be weird and uncomfortable, and yet people choose to do it together. In a time when many are feeling socially fragmented, there&#39;s something sweet, even necessary, about that total and shameless sincerity. However isolated we may be, and however much we depend on technologies that keep shifting beneath our feet, we keep trying to find ways back to our humanity and embodiment. So I have to admit: I&#39;m grateful for the stupid gesture, and I&#39;ll carry on doing it. It&#39;s a sign of how profoundly the world has changed—but also how humans, in essential ways, have not.<br><br> <em><small>When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

It&#39;s a sweet, funny, shrewd show that also features plenty of full-frontal male nudity. The effect is hard to categorize; <em>Minx</em> isn&#39;t “raunchy” or “smutty” or “filthy” or even “risqué.” Unlike <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/06/euphoria-hbo-review-zendaya/591955/">Euphoria</a></em> or <em>The Idol</em> , it&#39;s not interested in hollow provocation. And the penises that proliferate on-screen aren&#39;t there to titillate, exactly, although a montage in the first episode brings to mind what the French film theorist Jean-Louis Comolli once described as “the frenzy of the visible.” If anything, the show&#39;s insistent focus on male nudity feels impertinent, as though we&#39;re all participating in a ritual desanctification of dicks. The show&#39;s clever inversion of subject and object makes erotica seem faintly absurd: Here are men&#39;s bodies exposed for us to look at. Take away the novelty aspect, and what&#39;s left? What does the act of looking actually make us feel?<br><br> <em>Minx</em> is about Joyce (played by Ophelia Lovibond), a buttoned-up Vassar grad toiling away at a teen magazine while dreaming of securing funding for her austere second-wave-feminist publication, <em>The Matriarchy Awakens</em> . Her side project is the antithesis of sexy. (“Why is she so <em>angry</em> ?” a bewildered executive asks, looking at Joyce&#39;s cover subject, a frizzled activist, mouth agape, raising a fist.) But at a pitch conference, Joyce meets Doug (Jake Johnson, pulling off genial scuzzbucket as only he can), the publisher of a stable of pornographic magazines with titles such as <em>Milky Moms</em> and <em>Feet Feet Feet</em> . Doug is venal but smart; he senses a sea change in the sexual landscape—and an opportunity. To get people to pay attention, he tells Joyce, “You gotta hide the medicine. It&#39;s like, when you give a pill to a dog, you dip it in peanut butter first.” The medicine, in case it isn&#39;t totally clear, is radical feminist ideas, housed within a magazine the pair name <em>Minx</em> . The peanut butter? Naked men.<br><br> The question the show asks isn&#39;t whether the two creators will successfully collaborate—their odd-couple, non-romantic chemistry is far too good not to. It&#39;s whether sex can be used to successfully sell anything other than sex itself. <em>Minx</em> is a sly analysis of the tension between creative vision and commercial compromise, which makes its graceless cancellation feel even more pointed, although the second season was rescued by Starz, and premieres this week. The joy of Season 1, for me, lay in the show&#39;s unabashed championing of pleasure, its irreverent sense of humor, its allusions to fault lines in feminist history. But most interesting was how <em>Minx</em> , like the fictional magazine it was examining, wasn&#39;t just sandwiching subversive ideas together with sexual imagery. It was creating a dialogue between the two. For her first photoshoot, Joyce places her centerfold model, an adorable dodo named Shane, in the middle of a construction site, wearing nothing but a toolbelt, while three snarling women in power suits heckle him from the street. “It&#39;s the ability to look,” Joyce concludes. “It makes a woman feel powerful.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/08/bad-sex-nona-willis-aronowitz-book-review/671123/">Read: How should feminists have sex now?</a><br><br> But is <em>feeling</em> powerful enough? <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crooked.com/podcast-series/stiffed/"><em>Stiffed</em></a> , a recent podcast from the writer Jennifer Romolini, charts the history of <em>Viva</em> , the visionary feminist erotic magazine that helped inspire <em>Minx</em> , and that published Simone de Beauvoir, Lorraine O&#39;Grady, and Erica Jong next to soft-focus images of naked men. At its best, Romolini argues, <em>Viva</em> managed to be a “bridge between feminism, activism, sexuality, and groundbreaking journalism.” And yet, as the fact that you may very well have never heard of <em>Viva</em> attests, the magazine failed. It failed because its publisher, the <em>Penthouse</em> founder Bob Guccione, presumed to know what women wanted to see without actually endeavoring to find out. It failed because sexual representation, for women, particularly straight women, has always been a bind—our desires are often informed by the same chauvinistic terrain we&#39;re trying to transcend. Both <em>Minx</em> and <em>Viva</em> make one thing clear: Men have set the parameters of porn since the beginning.<br><br> <em>M <span class="smallcaps">inx</span></em> <span class="smallcaps">is set roughly around</span> 1972, at the beginning of a moment that <em>The New York Times</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/pornochic-hardcore-grows-fashionableand-very-profitable.html">crowned</a> “porno chic,” noting the prominence in popular culture of a feature-length porn film titled <em>Deep Throat</em> . Early in the show&#39;s new season, Joyce and Doug host the West Coast premiere of the movie, but keep hitting roadblocks: Feminist anti-porn campaigners are picketing outside, there&#39;s a streaker on the red carpet, and someone has replaced the projectionist&#39;s reel with the family film <em>Bedknobs and Broomsticks</em> . (Cue a joke about Angela Lansbury that I can&#39;t repeat.) Joyce, edgy and uncertain about the whole thing, runs into Joan Didion in the bathroom, who helps Joyce contextualize her feelings about a hard-core movie being so ceremoniously vaulted into the mainstream. “Doesn&#39;t it feel like people are longing for a way to be more open about sexuality without asking questions?” she asks Joan. She eventually pulls together an editor&#39;s letter for <em>Minx</em> titled “Why I Hated <em>Deep Throat</em> —And Why It&#39;s Good for America.”<br><br> The episode is indicative of my issues with Season 2: The show is glib where it used to be thoughtful, evasive about the exploitative edges of the business it&#39;s portraying, and seemingly more interested in staging a quippy &#39;70s costume party than engaging with the mission of the magazine at its center. Because as an object lesson in sexual representation on film, nothing is more loaded, or more fascinating, than <em>Deep Throat</em> . For the first time, hard-core pornography came packaged in the recognizable narrative structure of a movie, with dialogue and a plot and a heroine&#39;s journey. Not to mention that <em>Deep Throat</em> was funny, in a disarming, slapstick kind of way. It was sleazy, but not sinister. It made sex on-screen seem accessible to people who would never have been seen dead on 42nd Street.<br><br> More crucial, though, <em>Deep Throat</em> pulled off a confidence trick in plain sight: It disguised male fantasy as female empowerment. The movie&#39;s premise is that its central character (played by Linda Lovelace) has never had an orgasm and is left unsatisfied by conventional sexual encounters. When she consults a doctor, he informs her that her clitoris is actually located in the very back of her throat, meaning that only extremely committed fellatio will satisfy her. “Though it was touted as a celebration of female sexuality, <em>Deep Throat</em> can be seen as a study in the male control of female sexuality,” a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> retrospective <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-SEB-76264">concluded</a> in 2013. Lovelace later wrote in her memoir that she&#39;d been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/28/features.review">violently coerced into performing in the movie</a> . Before any of this, though, the movie was enshrined as one of the defining cultural spectacles of the sexual revolution. Martin Scorsese saw <em>Deep Throat</em> . So did Spiro Agnew—reportedly at Frank Sinatra&#39;s house—and Jackie Kennedy. (In the show, Joyce name-checks the stars present at the premiere: “Warren Beatty, Alans Arkin and Alda.”)<br><br> If the “joke” of <em>Deep Throat</em> was that it told women they could be most gratified and most liberated while on their knees, the prevailing message of the era for men was that objectification could be damaging. That year, Burt Reynolds posed nude for <em>Cosmopolitan</em> , resplendently hirsute—with a strategically placed arm—on a bearskin rug. The caption accompanying the image stated frankly that women&#39;s “visual appetites,” while equal to men&#39;s, had long been neglected, and that <em>Cosmo</em> was trying to redress the balance. The magazine sold out ( <em>Minx</em> ’s first episode takes some pleasure in showing women reading it openly in the workplace). But Reynolds <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/09/burt-reynolds-cosmo-centerfold-game-changer.html">came to regret the shoot</a> , calling it “a total fiasco” in his autobiography and lamenting that it prevented people from taking him seriously as an actor. Still, the image was trailblazing: Prior to the 1960s, as the author Nancy Friday writes in <em>Women on Top</em> , women weren&#39;t even acknowledged to have sexual fantasies, let alone take pleasure in the sexualized image of a male body.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/09/romance-novels-women-elinor-glyn-books/670609/">Read: Don&#39;t call them trash</a><br><br> <em>Viva</em> ’s mission, as Romolini explains on <em>Stiffed</em> , was to capitalize on this moment of flux. There was space for a magazine, everyone involved believed, that would acknowledge women as sexual beings (with high-quality erotic photography) while gratifying their political impulses with articles about the work-life balance, sexual liberation, and the case for not having children. The major hurdle, at least at first, was Guccione, who was progressive about sex and about promoting women in the workplace, but limited by his own sexual imagination: <em>Viva</em> ’s first issue featured mostly images of naked women in the <em>Penthouse</em> mode, along with articles by exclusively male writers including Norman Mailer. “I don&#39;t think [Bob] gave a moment&#39;s thought to what women wanted or needed,” one former <em>Viva</em> staffer tells Romolini.<br><br> Later, when Guccione conceded to demands—including from the woman who would become his wife, Kathy Keeton, whom he hired as editor—and started publishing pictures of naked men, things somehow only got more confounding. Advertisers fled; writers balked at having their bylines next to hazy, Vaseline-clouded photos of male genitalia. Perhaps most complicated, though, was the question of how to conceive of erotic images that would appeal to women. “It wasn&#39;t terribly nuanced—they could&#39;ve done better with the male nudes, made them more attractive from a woman&#39;s point of view,” the former <em>Viva</em> staffer Annie Gottlieb explained in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/books/a19601651/oral-history-viva-70s-porn-magazine-for-women/">an oral history</a> of <em>Viva</em> from 2018. “I thought they were funny, actually. They [seemed like] a man&#39;s attempt to imagine what a woman would like to look at. But, I mean, I&#39;ve seen a penis before. If I turned the page and there was one, I would shrug and turn [to] the next page.”<br><br> Fifty years later, we still haven&#39;t quite figured out how to honestly appraise female desire in mainstream culture—to cater to it in a way that isn&#39;t blurred by what men want to see. The commodification of sex-as-porn is part of the problem—think of the proliferation of the term <em>the money shot</em> , with its presumed primacy of the male orgasm. Although plenty of visionary women are making feminist porn, their work is typically paywalled, limiting their influence compared with the tsunami of violent, misogynist content that anyone, anywhere, can see for free in a given day. “Flesh comes to us out of history; so does the repression and taboo that governs our experience of flesh,” Angela Carter writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-sadeian-woman-angela-carter/9781844083770?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Sadeian Woman</em></a> . Sexuality, she concludes, “is never expressed in a vacuum.” In her TedX Talk, the feminist filmmaker Erika Lust recalls the moment that she realized what porn largely is—a discourse about sexuality where “the only ones participating in the discourse … are men.” It&#39;s not enough, as <em>Viva</em> learned, to simply invert subject and object and assume straight women will respond. There is power in looking, it&#39;s true. But there&#39;s more in getting to decide for ourselves what we want to be revealed, and what we want to reveal in turn.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/11/sex-love-and-goop-sex-education-netflix-sex-positivity/620588/">Read: Where sex positivity falls short</a><br><br> This is in no small part why <em>Minx</em> ’s abandonment of the ideas that made Season 1 so distinctive—the way it interrogated how to <em>sell</em> feminism while honoring the amorphousness of female desire—feels so disappointing. Watching <em>The Idol</em> recently (for my sins), I was struck by how old-fashioned it felt; how in thrall to <em>Deep Throat</em> ’s message that what women really crave, even if they don&#39;t know it, is degradation. Is this what Max canceled <em>Minx</em> for? In the final episode of <em>Stiffed</em> , the media consultant and sexual-equality advocate Cindy Gallop tells Romolini that “any industry that is male-dominated at the top inevitably produces output that is objectifying and offensive and objectionable to women.” More frustrating, though, is what Gallop concludes about the landscape of pornography and erotica, half a century after <em>Viva</em> , <em>Deep Throat</em> , and Burt Reynolds on that bearskin rug: that women have never been allowed to explore human sexuality through their own lens, free of external influences or commercial pressures or repression.

It&#39;s time for another round of Mounting Democratic Jitters, cherished summer pastime from Wilmington to the West Wing. Today&#39;s installment: Cornel West, unlikely MAGA accessory.<br><br> West, the famed academic and civil-rights activist, is a Green Party candidate for president. He probably will not win. Not a single state or, in all likelihood, a single electoral vote. But he remains a persistent object of concern around the president these days.<br><br> I&#39;ve talked with many of these White House worrywarts, along with their counterparts on Joe Biden&#39;s reelection team and the usual kettles of Democratic anxiety who start bubbling up whenever the next <em>existential-threat</em> election is upon us. Even with the nuisance primary challenger Robert F. Kennedy Jr. polling in the double digits, West inhabits a particular category of Democratic angst, the likes of which only the words <em>Green Party presidential candidate</em> can elicit.<br><br> You can understand the sensitivities, given the history. Democrats still recoil at the name Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee in 2016, whose vote total in key battlegrounds—Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania—wound up exceeding the margins by which Hillary Clinton lost in those states. What&#39;s Dr. Stein doing these days, anyway?<br><br> “She is my interim campaign manager,” Cornel West told me this week in a phone interview. Not a joke, as Biden would say. Or an acid flashback. Apparently Ralph Nader was not available. Not Dennis Kucinich, either (already snapped up to run RFK Jr.&#39;s campaign). It might be kind of funny if the stakes didn&#39;t involve a return Trump ordeal in the White House.<br><br> “The fact that Jill Stein is running his campaign is a little on the nose,” one senior Democratic campaign strategist told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/robert-f-kennedy-jr-presidential-campaign-misinformation-maga-support/674490/">Read: The first MAGA Democrat</a><br><br> West has repeatedly denied that he might play a spoiler role. “I would say that most of the people who vote for me would not have voted for Biden,” he told me. “They would have probably stayed home.” In a recent CNN appearance, West dismissed the two parties as a “corporate duopoly” and professed “great respect for my dear brother Ralph Nader and great respect for sister Jill Stein.” This did nothing to assuage Democratic jitters.<br><br> I asked West whether he would campaign all the way to Election Day 2024, or if he might reconsider his venture at some point. “My goal is to go all the way to November,” he said, but allowed that circumstances could change and so could his plans. “I&#39;m trying to be a jazzlike man,” he said. “Trying to be improvisational.”<br><br> In his campaign-launch <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/CornelWest/status/1665743761551548416">video</a> , West promised that his candidacy would focus on core progressive issues such as health care, housing, reproductive rights, and “de-escalating the destruction” done to the Earth and our democracy. “Neither political party wants to tell the truth,” West said, by way of explaining why he is running as a third-party candidate.<br><br> Notably, West has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/CornelWest/status/1678490771228622848">asserted</a> that NATO was as much to blame for Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine as the Kremlin. He has railed against the coalition as an “expanding instrument” of Western aggression, which he says is what provoked Russia&#39;s onslaught. “This proxy war between the American Empire and the Russian Federation could lead to World War III,” he wrote in a social-media post calling for diplomatic talks. West also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/CornelWest/status/1681684210040582146">dismissed</a> as a “sham” a House resolution—passed Tuesday—that affirmed US support for Israel. “The painful truth is that the Israeli state—like the USA—has been racist in practice since its inception,” West wrote on Twitter.<br><br> Several Democrats were eager to tell their own truths about West&#39;s endeavor, expressing uniform exasperation.<br><br> “This is not the time in order to experiment. This is not the time to play around on the margins,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4091419-democratic-jitters-grow-over-cornel-wests-third-party-bid/">warned</a> Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison during a recent appearance on MSNBC. “What we see is a lot of folks who want to be relevant and try to be relevant in these elections and not looking at the big picture.”<br><br> “Too little attention is being paid to this,” David Axelrod, the former top Barack Obama strategist, told me. Axelrod recently gave voice to the gathering Democratic freak-out when he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1677360196845469697">tweeted</a> out some basic historical parallels. “In 2016, the Green Party played an outsized role in tipping the election to Donald Trump,” he wrote. “Now, with Cornel West as their likely nominee, they could easily do it again.”<br><br> In our interview, Axelrod noted that the 2020 race between Biden and Trump, in which neither Stein nor West was on the ballot, underscores how slim the Democrats&#39; margin of error remains. “When you have three states that you won by 41,000 votes combined, you just cannot afford to bleed votes, even a few of them,” Axelrod told me.<br><br> Ben Wikler, the Democratic Party chair of one of these states—Wisconsin—said he expects Trump allies to help prop up any third-party effort as a way to undermine Biden. “Regardless of the motivations of third-party candidates themselves, they can have the effect of delivering net votes to Trump next year,” Wikler said, “especially if a Trump-aligned super PAC pours money into targeted messages,” he added. “And those are exactly the kind of cynical games you have to expect.”<br><br> Cedric Richmond, a former Democratic congressman and White House adviser who recently signed on as co-chair of the Biden campaign, called West a “substantive person.” But Richmond argued that Biden has earned the support of the left through his record on the environment, health care, gun reform, and other progressive causes. “They also know that [Biden] could have done a hell of a lot more if not for this hostile Supreme Court,” Richmond told me. “And they know they got this hostile Supreme Court because &#39;Hillary wasn&#39;t good enough,&#39; because &#39;we weren&#39;t happy and we wanted to support Jill Stein&#39; or whatever the reason was at the time.” Now that voters have experienced a Trump presidency, he said, the cost of casting a protest vote with a third-party candidate should be much more apparent. “I think people have seen this movie, and they know the ending,” Richmond said.<br><br> In recent days, the putative-centrist outfit No Labels—which many Democrats have been quick to <em>label</em> as a pro-Trump collaborator—has been the main source of third-party hand-wringing.  The group is trying to recruit a so-called unity ticket that would appear on ballots across the country, possibly led by Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/joe-lieberman-interview-no-labels-2024-election/674711/">Read: Joe Lieberman weighs the Trump risk</a><br><br> “The idea that a third-party candidate won&#39;t hurt the Democratic nominee is preposterous on its face,” Matt Bennett, executive vice president of Third Way, a center-left policy think tank that lately has been focused on stopping No Labels, told me. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/third-party-candidate-spoiler-trump-biden/">Recent polls</a> show that in a head-to-head race between Trump and Biden, Trump is more likely to benefit when a third-party candidate is added to the mix. Likewise, an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/dems-republicans-are-open-third-party-presidential-candidate-rcna91368">NBC survey</a> from last month revealed that 44 percent of registered voters would be open to a third-party candidate—and there were considerably more Democrats saying this (45 percent) than Republicans (34 percent).<br><br> But Bennett explained that if No Labels does not recruit a serious candidate to actually run, the group will remain a largely hypothetical menace. West, meanwhile, is definitely running. The Green Party has an organizational structure in place in many states that will ensure the nominee&#39;s position on general-election ballots. West has deep roots on the left, and is better known than Stein was in 2016. Like Clinton, Biden has faced uncertainty about how much enthusiasm he can expect from his own party, especially young progressives.<br><br> “博士。 West has a huge following among college-age voters and a lot of folks who are more interested in social movements than they are in supporting Democratic or Republican candidates,” Basil Smikle, a Democratic strategist who was the executive director of the State Democratic Party of New York from 2015 to 2018, told me.<br><br> West was a vocal supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders&#39;s presidential campaign in the 2020 Democratic primary. He has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/11/biden-democracy-penn-justice-democrats-socialists">said</a> that he wound up voting for Biden in the general election because “a fascist catastrophe is worse than a neoliberal disaster.” He also dubbed Biden “mediocre” and “milquetoast” (a tepid endorsement, let&#39;s say).<br><br> Supporters of Biden are hopeful that the blessing of progressive allies such as Sanders, who endorsed his reelection in April, will insulate the president from the threat of West-inspired defections to the Green Party. “What Bernie can do is say, &#39;Look man, we thought the existential threat of Trump had waned, but it&#39;s still here,&#39;” Smikle said. “We need you to show up again.”<br><br> Another prominent Bernie booster from 2020, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, endorsed Biden during a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crooked.com/podcast/the-biden-bump-with-aoc/">appearance</a> on the podcast <em>Pod Save America</em> . The host Jon Favreau asked a follow-up about what she thought of West. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to tread carefully but sounded deferential. “I think Dr. West has an incredible history in this country,” she said. “What he gives voice to is incredibly important.” She went on to slam No Labels as a source of great concern, given “the sheer amount of money and bad-faith actors involved with it.”<br><br> “Not all third-party candidacies are created equal,” Ocasio-Cortez summarized. But she landed on a pragmatic point. “The United States has a winner-take-all system, whether we like that or not,” she said, adding that the cost of messing around could be fascism. “We have to live with that reality,” she said. Live with Joe Biden, in other words. Because the alternative is far worse—not a joke.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 12:40:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/biden-cornel-west-no-labels-2024-election/674757/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/biden-cornel-west-no-labels-2024-election/674757/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Can’t We Quit Weddings?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Marriages aren&#39;t what they used to be.

Women as breadwinners. Stay-at-home dads. Gay marriages. Polyamorous marriages! Yet despite all these evolutions, the ritual that ushers in those marriages—the American wedding—has hardly changed at all. Weddings <em>are</em> constantly evolving, but often in the direction of more elaborate, more luxe, more wedding-like. Why are we obsessed with perfecting what is essentially a 19th-century artifact?<br><br> In this episode, we talk to Xochitl Gonzalez, who wrote a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/07/luxury-wedding-planners-industrial-complex-cost/674169/">confessional</a> for <em>The Atlantic</em> about her years as a luxury wedding planner, and authored <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Olga-Dies-Dreaming-Xochitl-Gonzalez/dp/1250786177">Olga Dies Dreaming,</a></em> a bestselling novel about a luxury wedding planner and a cast of obnoxious clients. Gonzalez tells us about the out-there demands of the uber rich. (Preview: monks; pizza; an orchid bear.) We talk about how those demands trickle down to the average couple, with delusions of a celebrity-style wedding, done on the cheap. And we puzzle over the big question: Why are we so fixated on this grand old tradition?<br><br> Listen to the conversation here: <br><br><iframe class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.megaphone.fm/ATL3903853621" frameborder="no" height="200" scrolling="no" title="嵌入互动内容" width="100%" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe> <em>Subscribe here: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/radio-atlantic/id1258635512">Apple Podcasts</a> |<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4PgNKjRJJWlaV6zuNr69BO">Spotify</a> | <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/radio-atlantic">Stitcher</a> | <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vcmFkaW9hdGxhbnRpYw">Google Podcasts</a> | <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pca.st/ccxU">Pocket Casts</a></em><br><br> <strong><em>The following is a transcript of the episode:</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Hanna Rosin:</strong> I watched <em>The Wedding Planner</em> last night. Just, I was like: <em>Oh my God.</em><br><br> <strong>Xochitl Gonzalez:</strong> Can we talk about it? Because I know that movie like the back of my hand.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I mean, I love J. Lo, but I have not dipped into a rom-com from that era in a while. Every moment of it felt kind of manufactured and awkward.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Oh, so completely. That is like the era of the cultural stereotype.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yes.是的！<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Of shorthand, right? Like one trope after another. Although there&#39;s a great line when the boss of her little wedding-planning operation is like: “I&#39;ve done things no innocent planner should ever have to.”<br><br> [ <em>Laughter.</em> ]<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right. I did think of you when I heard that line.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Right. It&#39;s a good line. That&#39;s actually a good line.<br><br> <strong><em>[MUSIC]</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I&#39;m Hanna Rosin. This is <em>Radio Atlantic</em> . If you&#39;re getting married this summer, I pity you. Not because of the marriage. I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll be fine. But because of the wedding. Social media seems to have changed the game for the average couple. Every wedding is now supposed to look like a luxury wedding and yet somehow cost a lot less than an actual luxury wedding.<br><br> But the weirdest thing for me is that weddings still exist at all. Marriage is totally different than it used to be. Women&#39;s roles are totally different. And yet the wedding just keeps getting more … wedding-y.<br><br> Why do we keep innovating and improving on what is basically an artifact from the early 19th century?<br><br> So because surely some of you out there are attending a wedding or 15 this summer, we are going to talk about weddings with someone who has lived through many, many of them: <em>Atlantic</em> writer Xochitl Gonzalez. She just wrote a confessional for the magazine about her years running a luxury wedding business. And before that she wrote an exceptional novel called <em>Olga Dies Dreaming</em> about a wedding planner, that was way more intense about the class and race dynamics of the American luxury wedding than the Jennifer Lopez movie. Why do we have to mention that movie? Hi, Xochitl.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Hi. It&#39;s so nice to talk to you.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s nice to talk to you. So I wanted to go back to a time when you were first starting out planning luxury weddings. What year was that?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> It was 2003 when I started. But I should say: You kind of have to work, unless, I always say, unless your name is Bronson Van Wick. Who&#39;s a real person who&#39;s extremely successful, and you have that kind of name—where it&#39;s like, <em>Oh, Bronson Van Wick</em> . I think you have to sort of work your way up the ranks.<br><br> Does that make sense?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. Like in the movie.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yeah. So it probably took us maybe two or three years before we were really doing luxury weddings. Which at that time, probably anything over 75 was considered luxury.<br><br> And then you get into ultra-luxury, which then was probably anything over a quarter of a million dollars. Which I know sounds like a lot, and to my jaded wedding-planning eyes, it&#39;s like, <em>Eh, it doesn&#39;t get you that far</em> .<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh my God. All right, so let&#39;s say around 2005 you start planning some serious weddings. What is the first request someone made of you that you were like, <em>Oh, okay, okay, okay</em> ?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> I mean, then I&#39;m going to say that it was relatively reasonable, right? It was like: “Could you get me this celebrity singer to come to the wedding?” Like: “I want every table to have an ice sculpture, with the flower arrangement frozen inside of it.”<br><br> You know, it was just weird stuff that they maybe had seen in a magazine. Or [since] this is the dawn of wedding TV, that they might have seen on wedding television. Everything was very celebrity and upscale-emulating.<br><br> At the time, Preston Bailey was like the pinnacle of weddings. And he was doing this thing where he would make animals out of flowers. So, like an eight-foot-tall bear made out of orchids. That kind of thing. And so people would be like: “Could I have little animals made out of roses?”<br><br> So it wasn&#39;t that creative in the beginning. And then as it went on, you started to get weird gag things. Like: “I want to bring up this pony during a toast.” Or I had somebody that was like: “I want to have tattoos set up at the after-party so that my granny can get a tat at my wedding.”<br><br> And so you have a remote tattoo artist coming into town. But the first area that I&#39;d say things started to get unusual, really, was the ceremony. We had a couple that was like: “You have to fly this monk in from Tibet. And then you have to help our rabbi get a visa because we need this one particular rabbi, because he was famous for being like the first gay rabbi in a particular denomination.”<br><br> We had one couple that didn&#39;t want to leave a carbon footprint for their ceremony. That was a big deal at one point. Nobody wanted to leave a carbon footprint. So we used real trees that then we had to find a place to replant them.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> God, Xochitl. I have to stop you and say, like: <em>This is insane.</em> I mean, this is not what I was expecting. I thought it would be like a cute little story and, no, it&#39;s like: <em>fly a Buddhist in from Tibet…</em><br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Oh yeah.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Transplant trees! I mean, this is like the things that you have seen are <em>extra</em> . I mean, what was the thought going through your head? When somebody calls you and they&#39;re like: “I would like a Buddhist flown in from a different country,” what is going through your head?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Well, it was kind of a frog boil. So I always feel like I don&#39;t do that well with these questions, because at the time, you just were like, “Oh, okay. Of course.” Because, the week before, you had just gotten a slightly less crazy request. So they just sort of kept escalating, and you&#39;re like: “Well, obviously we&#39;ve gotta get the monk from Tibet here.”<br><br> And then, you&#39;re like, “Well, is he willing to fly commercial?” That&#39;s like your first question.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh my God. I could hear that in your voice. I could hear that you were lapsing into normal mode where it&#39;s just like, <em>Sure, I&#39;ll do this, and I&#39;ll do that, and I&#39;ll do that.</em> Like as you&#39;re telling me, I&#39;m realizing how otherworldly this is. But for you, it just registers as another thing on your checklist.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yeah. I think that the hardest part about writing about it is sometimes recognizing when things were strange. Do you know what?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yes.是的。<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> You&#39;re like, <em>Wait, okay.这很奇怪。</em> Now that I&#39;m away from it, I can see how that was strange.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right. So what I understand was at first the wedding requests were derivative because there were a lot of wedding magazines. And so people just saw what other people had, and they wanted those things.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Totally. And you had more wedding magazines, which I think is so hard for people to even wrap their heads around.<br><br> But there was <em>Inside Weddings</em> , <em>In Style Weddings</em> , <em>Modern Bride</em> . And then you had <em>The Knot</em> , and then you had Martha Stewart, and then you had regional versions. like, so you would have <em>Brides</em> and then you&#39;d have <em>New York Bride</em> . You&#39;d have <em>The Knot</em> and then you&#39;d have <em>The Knot New York</em> .<br><br> You just had so much bridal content on newsstands. And then—&#39;06, &#39;07—you start getting blogs.<br><br> So now you&#39;ve got digital media. You&#39;ve got print media still happening; you have books. You had Pinterest. You could be doing wedding stuff. You could be watching a wedding movie. You could be going crazy on blogs all night. You could be reading magazines on the subway on your way to and from work. You could be buying advice books and etiquette books and design books. Like, you could spend a small fortune just on bridal media.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I mean, there really was a wedding-industrial complex.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> There was!<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> That&#39;s not a made-up term.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> No, you know,—I think there was a rebellion against the “traditional wedding,” right? There was this overtaking, of like: <em>How can I make this feel like only</em> we <em>would have this wedding?</em>正确的？ I think that there was like a chicken and the egg.<br><br> Blogs came about, and kind of really drove that. Because suddenly it&#39;s not Darcy Miller at Martha Stewart determining whether or not this is good enough to be in print, right? It&#39;s like, <em>I need content</em> . To go up like 10 times a day, right, on this blog.<br><br> And so you were sort of like, <em>Well, what are we going to do?</em> You know, we did this one thing, and it was like pinwheels and calico prints. [ <em>Laughter.</em> ] And I think that was like one of the first weddings—it was like a phase, I call it “The Bunting Years,” where everybody had bunting everywhere. And we were sort of like pioneers in bunting. And I&#39;m obviously quite proud of that.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> [ <em>Laughs.</em> ] Congratulations.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yes, I know. Really I was very, very proud of that. And that wedding—I remember again, I was so proud of this—we had custom-made yarmulkes in denim and calico.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Mm-hmm.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> It was so cute. It was very cute. But like, you know, I think what ends up happening is the &#39;00s—the era when I got into it—was sort of an era of growing flash. And it just kind of kept increasing and increasing and increasing throughout that decade, until the recession. And then we sort of merged into like—weird, I don&#39;t want to say that it was “quiet luxury,” but it was more whispered. It was spent; it was quirky luxury. Quirky luxury.<br><br> Before the recession, finance was a bigger section of the luxury wedding market, but not necessarily people with inherited wealth.<br><br> You know, like they&#39;re probably middle-class people that ended up going to business school, and, you know, they&#39;re spending their Goldman money on a wedding. And they wanted to have nice weddings that would impress their friends.<br><br> And then after the recession, what happened was almost all the clientele in the luxury sector shifted to people with inherited wealth.<br><br> So like: They may have done well themselves, but their parents had also done very well. And that was who then felt comfortable, I think, after this giant shakeup in the economy. These were the people that still felt comfortable spending that kind of money, but they didn&#39;t want people to know they were spending that kind of money.<br><br> So you start to get that twee aesthetic: where everything&#39;s super-custom, but at the same time, it&#39;s not the Plaza with orchids splattered all over the walls, right? It&#39;s like flowers grown on a farm that only grew these flowers for your wedding, right?<br><br> I think we did the very first wedding that Roberta&#39;s ever catered, and we had to bring up all of their pizza ovens. And, you know, it sounds really casual, right? You&#39;re like, “Roberta&#39;s is catering my wedding.”<br><br> And then it&#39;s like: No, they&#39;ve never catered anything before, and we are basically recreating their kitchen in a field. So it&#39;s actually not cheap at all. But the couple wanted to be able to tell people “Roberta&#39;s is doing my catering.”<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right, right. We should say: Roberta&#39;s is a famous hipster pizza place in Bushwick, Brooklyn. And so what are you learning about the ultra-wealthy as you&#39;re going through this? Because it sounds like they go through eras. One era of conspicuous consumption moves into the next era of understated elegance.<br><br> I mean, we like to flatten the motivations and desires of the ultra-rich, but what do you think they wanted? I mean, partly it&#39;s to get into a magazine or a blog?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Well, actually, I would say that I think that is a more middle-class desire, to be honest. Like, I think that the ultra-rich are much more content with the people that were there seeing it. There&#39;s a bit of social media, but there&#39;s a remarkable amount of privacy around this stuff.<br><br> And especially I&#39;d say that trend has even increased since I&#39;ve left. Like in talking to different people still in the business—you know, when I say “ultra luxury,” I&#39;m saying $2, $3, $4 million on a wedding. Like, there is a desire to not necessarily have every single thing sprawled over, and the sense that that makes it more exclusive to the people that were there.<br><br> Exclusivity is a big thing. It&#39;s probably part of the reason why you see so many very wealthy people having tent weddings—because they want to go to a location that nobody has gone to before.正确的？ So maybe that&#39;s like: You&#39;re housed at a hotel, but you&#39;re going to be down by a lake that no one&#39;s ever used for a wedding before. Exclusivity and rarity, and giving guests access to that, is a big part of what I think the ultra-wealthy are trying to achieve with their weddings.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Got it. So for the ultra-wealthy, it&#39;s an air of mystery. Specificity. Exclusivity. And then how does that filter down to everyone else?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> So what&#39;ll happen is—and you know, I spoke with this wonderful photographer, Alan Zapata. He charges I think around $40,000 and $50,000 for a wedding weekend.<br><br> And he&#39;s like: “The No. 1 thing I have to do is get like 10 or 12 images ready to put on social media.” So it&#39;s not that they&#39;re not sharing; it&#39;s just that they&#39;re sharing very selectively. So what happens is these will go out. And in the olden days, maybe a wedding would go in a magazine—like you might see, let&#39;s say, Chelsea Clinton&#39;s wedding, right?<br><br> And <em>People</em> then might do an interview with the person who planned it, Bryan Rafanelli. And Bryan will say, like: “Oh, here&#39;s a way to get Chelsea&#39;s look for less.” And you know, he&#39;ll do a little editorial thing. What happens now is that people see this on social media, and it&#39;s given without any context, right? So you see, let&#39;s say Kim [Kardashian]—I&#39;m thinking of a famous image like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a43070/kanye-west-gives-white-rose-to-kim-valentines-day-2017/">Kim and Kanye [West]&#39;s floral wall</a> . You see it in a magazine; it&#39;s like: “How to Get That Look for Less.” And [it&#39;s] like: Do it with carnations. You know, it was done with roses and orchids, like whatever. And now you end up just seeing it with no context, with no information, with no kind of like, quote unquote, wedding education.<br><br> And so it creates desire in people that are soon to be brides and grooms, and it creates desire without any attachment to knowledge. It&#39;s like, I could see a Chanel gown and know, <em>Well, that&#39;s a very nice gown, but I&#39;m not buying that.</em><br><br>正确的？ But there&#39;s no sense that this is the Chanel of wedding flowers, right?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So because it&#39;s appearing in your feed, it feels utterly attainable. You&#39;re like, <em>Oh, there&#39;s a picture. It&#39;s scrolling down my feed.</em>是的。<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> It&#39;s like the next thing you see. Like your college roommate&#39;s baby shower. It&#39;s mixed in with content of people that are real-life people, but then these are not necessarily even people that you exactly know. And so I think it sort of makes a scramble in the brain, where it&#39;s like, <em>Well, I now need to have this</em> —because it becomes detached from any reality of the wealth that&#39;s supporting that.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> But you know, the mania just keeps transforming, and it doesn&#39;t change anything for the actual couple. It makes it worse, because at first you have all these standard-bearers, like the magazines and the central blogs. And then it just becomes democratized. And so everybody has to do it for themselves.<br><br> So everybody has to create their own perfect photo shoot. That would&#39;ve been, say, a bridal-magazine photo shoot. But you&#39;re expected to somehow do it, create it, and pay for it yourself.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yeah, you know, I&#39;d written a piece about this ages ago about my bra fitter—like the lady where I buy my bras on Atlantic Avenue. And this woman&#39;s been in bras for 40 years, right?<br><br> And I was like, “I go to her because she&#39;s an expert.” I think what has happened in the democratization of imagery, because it&#39;s not really information necessarily, is the demise of expertise. And I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s helped people. I think it&#39;s created more confusion. I think that there&#39;s not necessarily reliable sources to even know what to ask.<br><br> So I always am curious: In that sort of middle tier, how good are those experiences that you&#39;re seeing? Like, I think that people are performing on Instagram and taking out money—you know, for the things that are going to get them attention on the Gram.<br><br> To spend money on choreographies [so] you can do a choreographed dance that&#39;ll get you hits on TikTok. Like, I wonder what these guests are eating. I wonder what they&#39;re drinking. You know? I wonder what the experience is on the other side, and I wonder how much people care.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right. Because you have to skimp somewhere.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Right? And that&#39;s also the stuff that really costs the most. Giving a very nice meal; making sure people have transportation to and from the ceremony, back to the reception, back to the hotel after they&#39;ve been drinking all night. Like, that&#39;s the stuff that starts to really add up. But you don&#39;t see that on the Gram, right?<br><br> <strong><em>[MUSIC]</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> After the break, we check in with a bespoke pyrotechnics expert on how to give your wedding the grand entrance of your dreams…<br><br>只是在开玩笑。 We&#39;re going to discuss why we can&#39;t seem to quit the ever-bigger, ever-fancier, and ever-more-expensive wedding.<br><br> <strong><em>[MUSIC]</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So, we&#39;ve talked about how couples see these luxury weddings on Instagram. And then, how does that have real effects on their typical wedding?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> So I think it sort of trickles down, and then people want. You know, I discovered this did not exist when I was still in the business. But two kinds of cottage industries have come up.<br><br> Wedding styling. You know, like in terms of the way you think of a stylist that&#39;s going to get you ready for a runway if you&#39;re a celebrity. Wedding styling has been around for maybe 20 years or so, but it was a very exclusive service, right? Like it was really for the upper tier of the market.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> When you say “wedding styling,” I just think someone comes in and does your hair—<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> No, so this is like: “I&#39;m going to help you find the dress, the shoes, the accessory.” Now it&#39;s expanded to the look that&#39;s going to coordinate that for your engagement photos, for the rehearsal dinner. What are you going to wear for the day-after brunch? Like, if you have an excursion during your wedding weekend, what are you going to wear for that? So it&#39;s like a whole series of “bridal looks.”<br><br> And then the other little strange thing that I wasn&#39;t expecting at all is: Social-media professionals to come and sort of document your wedding specifically for social media.<br><br> So they will be on TikTok; they&#39;ll be making reels. They&#39;ll be posting up select photos like in real time. And one of the services will “develop a strategy” for your wedding. And like their tagline was: “Because the day you spent 14 months planning should be seen by the world.”<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh my God. No. I mean: Is this trickle-down luxury to you? To someone inside, [is] it a good thing or a bad thing? To me, it&#39;s very stressful. Just hearing you lay it out. I&#39;m really glad I&#39;m not getting married right now, but what do you think?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> To me, I think it&#39;s pretty stressful. I guess I could say I get worried about society, right? And what living virtually has done to us in terms of our priorities, about real life versus appearances, if that makes sense. And so I&#39;m not against weddings—you know, I had a relatively low-budget [wedding]. I&#39;m not married anymore, but I never regret having that wedding because, you know, my grandfather walked me down the aisle. We did the dance. I have those memories. I have these great photos of me and my best friends who were still my best friends. I remember I have these memories of us getting ready together, and doing the whole thing.<br><br> And this was great. But it was not only a different time economically when I did that—that was around &#39;04 or &#39;05—but it was also a different mindset. And that sense is certainly not pervading the general population of the economy right now.<br><br> And so I think that&#39;s why I&#39;m sort of shocked at the way in which money&#39;s getting spent sort of flippantly. More people are taking on wedding debt now than ever before, and through personal loans too. Like, it&#39;s not even just credit-card debt; it&#39;s taking out personal loans to finance or supplement their weddings at sometimes up to 30 percent interest rates.<br><br> And knowing that—is it for people&#39;s experience? Is it for the memory, or is it for the Gram? And that part makes me a little nervous or uncomfortable, I should say.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. I&#39;m really confused by why we just cling to this tradition. Like as you&#39;re talking, I&#39;m thinking: Has not one single couple, when you were wedding planning, just said “No”? Like, “This is not us. This is nothing to do with our life. Like we&#39;re putting ourselves in aspic, like getting this perfect old tradition, and to the max—but this is not us, and I don&#39;t want to do it.”<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Well, probably. It&#39;s self-selected by the people that came in the door, right? I will say, I did have one couple; they called off their wedding because the mom of the bride was so particular and worried about what people thought and how things were going to be perceived. And they started to bicker. And they ended up, they were like, “We don&#39;t want to do this. This is terrible. We don&#39;t even want to be together anymore.” And they called off the wedding. And I remember running into them, separately, like a year later. You know, they were not together. And like: “I think it&#39;s probably the best thing that we did. The wedding was just too much.”<br><br> And then after that, like two years later, they ended up just eloping. They got back together; they eloped. And the desire to have this perfect wedding that represented “them as a couple” just was too much. Literally, they were like, “I can&#39;t do it.”<br><br> But I think it was also money that everybody had, right? So the calculus was different. I think I&#39;m sort of just disconcerted to a certain extent at, like: What is the point of making it a visually stunning event if you know that you&#39;re going to be kind of paying that back for forever?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Because you just get one second of—<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> It&#39;s a dopamine hit, right?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. Well, what do you think? Like, marriages are so different. Fewer people are getting married. Women&#39;s roles are so different. And we keep injecting this one tradition with so much money, so much importance. Like, so much perfection. It&#39;s really odd.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> So, you know, the wedding in America the way that we think about it, right? The white dress and the reception. That sort of all emerged in the &#39;50s post-war, right? Like, when we had a middle class.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> And it was this kind of way to say: “Here we are as a family.”正确的？ Like for the bride&#39;s family to be like: “We are in the middle class.” And so the niceness of the wedding was a performative way for your neighbors and your community, your church community, your residential community to see, like: <em>Oh, okay.</em> Like: <em>Look what they were able to do for their daughter.</em> And there was a certain aspect of the lady&#39;s hurrah, right? The bride&#39;s hurrah of showing herself off.<br><br> And I think what&#39;s funny is that as we&#39;ve been able to sort of let go of ... like, I think the number of people that anticipate buying a home has declined, right?<br><br> We&#39;ve let go of so many “middle-class American aspirations,” but we haven&#39;t been able to let go of the wedding. It&#39;s not perceived as a luxury. Weddings, period, <em>are</em> a luxury. Whether you are in the luxury end of the market or not, they are a luxury start to finish.<br><br> But there&#39;s something that we have not accepted as a luxury. They feel like an entitlement. Like: If you are going to marry, and by that I mean legally do it, then if you are an American and you consider yourself middle class, you should be able to have a nice wedding.<br><br> And I think that&#39;s where a lot of the resentment of the cost comes in. It&#39;s like, “You running your business is stopping me from having my nice wedding that I&#39;m entitled to.”<br><br> And I think that there&#39;s a real reluctance to give up the dream.<br><br> It&#39;s one of the few middle-class dreams that I think people don&#39;t want to give up. People have given up on college, and I don&#39;t think that they want to give up on weddings.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> But I mean, we have definitely transformed the traditional marriage. Like, if you had a friend who had a very stereotypical 1950s-style marriage where the gender roles were very rigidly prescribed, you might be confused. We just don&#39;t do that anymore. Like, women&#39;s roles are dismantled. But—we refuse, we will not dismantle the proposal, the wedding dress. The wedding. So many things about the wedding are so traditional.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> One of the things that I think is probably the funniest to me is that we did a pop-up wedding chapel with The Knot the weekend that gay marriage passed in New York.好的。 And we had two or three little ceremony setups, and I think [something] like 20 couples got married in Central Park that day. And I remember being like, <em>This is so cute.</em><br><br> Like, this is bad for business. But I was like, wouldn&#39;t this be great if in expanding what marriage [is], who can get married, we expand what could be a nice wedding. And then instead you fast-forward 20 years, and it&#39;s just like: Everybody&#39;s still having these super-traditional weddings.<br><br> [ <em>Laughter.</em> ]<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I was going to say, I&#39;ve been to many a gay wedding—<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> I was going to say: I feel like the gay weddings that I&#39;ve been to have been just as, if not more, elaborate—right?—than any of the hetero weddings. So I almost think it&#39;s hilarious that when you think about the total deconstruct of that 1950s stereotype of what a marriage is like, we still can&#39;t get away from the wedding.<br><br> And I think it&#39;s got romance attached to it. And I think there is sort of this idea, again, of in a funny way, it is not the right to live together in relationship.<br><br> And you know, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://youtu.be/po9-NWhk1Qo?t=42">it&#39;s that great Sondheim song like about marriage. Like, “It&#39;s the little things you do together.”</a> It&#39;s not about that part. It&#39;s literally about the right to have a wedding.<br><br> [ <em>Laughter.</em> ]<br><br> It&#39;s like the fight for your right to party: like literally. And so I think that in some ways we&#39;ve conflated a good wedding with good marriage.<br><br> And I do think we&#39;ve become obsessed, in this country, with celebrity. And I think it&#39;s sort of a performative way to now have both. You know, show off some class status. But more than anything, I think people are like: It&#39;s a way to sort of have celebrity [status] for a day. Like, attainable celebrity for a day.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So in the way that you&#39;d want to, you used to want to be a princess for the day, or royalty—<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yes. Now you&#39;re like a Kardashian for the day, right? And what does that come with? It comes with luxury: It comes with designer clothes, it comes with a glam squad. It comes with a camera following you around the entire day. It comes with all these things. And like, people don&#39;t want to give that up.<br><br> So it&#39;s a tiny version of celebrity. I think what&#39;s funny to me when I kept thinking about it is people will sit and like hem and haw about like, “Oh, can we afford to get a car? Can we afford to do this? Can we afford to like, send our kid to this school?” And in the meantime, they&#39;ll be like, for no hands down, “Just borrow $50,000. Let&#39;s have this wedding.”<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh my.正确的。 You know, in the Jennifer Lopez movie, which I just rewatched last night, she herself is chasing the dream. Like, she wants to have her own wedding. And in your novel <em>Olga Dies Dreaming</em> , which I loved, Olga ends up with a guy, and there&#39;s no wedding in sight.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> No.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> And she seems, like, way more herself. Is there some message I&#39;m supposed to read into that? Like, just forget the wedding?<br><br> Where did you land, because you wrote this novel when you&#39;ve essentially exited wedding planning, right?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yes; I&#39;d exited. And you know, I think she was commitment-phobic in the beginning of the novel and ends up with somebody, but she&#39;s got serious commitment issues. And I think I&#39;ve landed on: The relationship is so much more important than the performance of the relationship.<br><br> I love a good party. I think, if you&#39;ve got the cash—who doesn&#39;t love a good party? But I don&#39;t know that the wedding has to be the reason for the party. A party for no reason&#39;s also kind of fun.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So: Skip the wedding; just have a party. That&#39;s your mantra now?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yeah. I still support parties.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. Pro-party.好的！ Well, you are working on a new novel. There&#39;s going to be a cover reveal soon. Is there anything else you want to say about it?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s about power and creative couples. It&#39;s a first-generation art-history student in an Ivy League school who discovers a forgotten female genius artist who was murdered by her husband 20 years before. And I&#39;m very excited about it. It&#39;s a little bit of a mystery.<br><br> It&#39;s a little bit of a campus novel. It&#39;s a little ghosty. And it&#39;s called <em>Anita de Monte Laughs Last</em> .<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Ooh.惊人的。 Can&#39;t wait.
