年代长大，在弗吉尼亚州的一个农场里长大，距离任何城镇或邻居都只有几英里远。在我童年的大部分时间里，我们没有电视，所以我和我的三个兄弟在我们房子周围的田野和树林里假装内战，或者争夺我们铺在客厅地板上的纸牌和棋盘游戏来取乐。 。<br><br>但对我来说，最好的娱乐总是读书。我读书是为了乐趣，为了陪伴，为了逃离我封闭的弗吉尼亚世界。我可以探索其他地方，想象自己进入其他生活——这种生活超出了我母亲和她圈子里的女性所能提供的有限选择，她们都受到那个时代女性家庭生活规定的统治。文字让我了解了女孩<em>可以</em>做的事情：像南希·德鲁一样解开谜团；像安妮·弗兰克一样勇敢地面对纳粹；需求改变，就像<em>《Susan Anthony: Girl Who Dared》</em>的主角一样。借用斯考特在<em>《杀死一只知更鸟》</em>中的话来说，阅读可以提供一种逃离“粉红色棉质监狱的浆糊墙壁逼近我”的方法。言语可以带我越过我们房子后面升起的蓝岭山脉的缓坡。他们提出了对国家和全球事务的看法，让我产生了紧迫感。令我感到害怕的是，人造卫星已经发射升空，并且每 96 分钟就会在其地球轨道上飞过头顶。我想知道俄罗斯人是如何在太空中击败我们的。匈牙利人反对共产主义的勇气激励了我。战后美国充满信心的繁荣景象让我感到安心。然而，当我读到有关破坏它的动荡和冲突的描述时，我感到越来越怀疑和不安。<br><br>我们没有收到普通日报。我父亲从事马业，所以<em>《</em><em>晨报》——</em>纯种马赛马的圣经——每天都会出现在早餐桌上。当他教我解读当天跑步的每匹马打印的复杂的“过去表现”图表时，我感到很自豪，图表详细说明了之前的比赛、负重、分段时间和比赛结果：获胜、名次、表演或同时参加。 <em>《电讯报》</em>包含了人们想要的关于赛道世界的所有新闻，但几乎没有关于公共事务世界的新闻。<br><br>我们确实收到了很多杂志。我父亲买了一本一次性的<em>《花花公子》</em> ，把它塞在家里书柜的角落里，我们孩子们不可避免地会发现它们。我记得仔细阅读内容时，总是对插页中的女性感到惊讶，她们看起来就像我从未见过的人，无论穿着还是其他方面。然而，大多数杂志都放在书房的木架上，旁边是楼梯下一张舒适的软垫椅子。这是一个吸引人的阅读场所，有一个吸引人的出版物图书馆。 <em>《体育画报》</em> 、 <em>《周六晚邮报</em>》和<em>《马纪事报》</em>都是常客， <em>《纽约客》</em>也是常客，它的漫画吸引了我，尽管我常常不得不请父母解释为什么其中的漫画很有趣。 。<br><br>最重要的是，我阅读<em>《生活》</em>杂志。很难想象，在当今碎片化的媒体环境中，任何单一信息来源如何能够覆盖全国的一小部分地区。 1950 年，估计有一半的美国人每周都会看<em>《生活》杂志</em>。我就是其中之一。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/mailer-on-the-moon/590629/">阅读：“魔鬼设计的艺术品”</a><br><br><em>现在</em>，六十多年过去了，我翻阅了一本又一本涵盖我童年时光的杂志，我对它所描绘的 20 世纪 50 年代的世界如此熟悉又如此陌生感到震惊。戴维·克罗克特 (Davy Crockett) 浣熊皮帽、呼拉圈、弹簧单高跷、猫王—— <em>《生活》</em>杂志记载的狂热甚至蔓延到了弗吉尼亚乡村。我几乎认出了该杂志每期数十页广告中推销的每一种产品，尽管其中许多产品已经存在多年了。大多数期刊的封底都展示了整版香烟广告——Lucky Strikes（“更干净、更清新、更顺滑”）或Camels（“快乐有助于你的性情，这是一个心理学事实！这就是为什么日常快乐——例如吸烟” ——意义重大。”） <em>《生活》</em>杂志发表的一篇关于分娩的新闻报道描述了一名妇女在分娩时吸烟的故事。现在这让我感到震惊，但当时我认为家中充满了母亲每天一包骆驼和父亲的雪茄产生的烟雾是理所当然的。<br><br>杂志中的多页跨页展示了最新型号的大型汽车，这些汽车的设计就像我们的家庭旅行车一样，旨在运送婴儿潮时期的所有儿童。这些广告中的车辆都配有华丽的鳍片，而且通常是时尚的两种色调，尽管到了本世纪末，纳什·兰布勒 (Nash Rambler)、福特猎鹰 (Ford Falcon) 甚至大众甲壳虫 (VW Beetle) 等小型车型也开始发起挑战。<br><br> <em>《生活》</em>中出现的食物现在看来几乎是难以想象的。<br><br>一则汽水广告敦促家长在婴儿奶瓶中添加7Up，以哄他们喝奶（建议比例：各半）。另一则广告宣布“全国用完剩菜做果冻沙拉周”的到来。对于精致的西南烧烤来说，“所有东西，甚至肉，都来自罐头。” 20世纪50年代中期，美国家庭平均每年消耗850罐食品。 1955 年 1 月的一期食品特刊赞扬了“冷冻、罐装、脱水和预煮食品中内置的仆人，它们为忙碌的女性在准备日常膳食时提供了一千个额外的帮助”。这些忙碌的女性总是匆匆忙忙，并且欢迎速溶燕麦片、速溶咖啡和斯旺森电视晚餐等创新产品。<br><br><em>生活</em>记录了当代存在的各个方面的出现，我倾向于认为这些方面从一开始就存在。这是信用卡进入美国人生活的十年。州际公路系统于 1956 年启动。乘客乘坐喷气式飞机旅行始于 1958 年。在这十年的前半段， <em>《生活》杂志</em>经常报道令人不安的飞机失事事件，令人震惊的是，也许是因为空中交通管制只存在于机场附近，而飞行员本身负责在其他飞机未起飞或降落时发现它们。 1956 年，两名飞行员在大峡谷上空执行任务失败，造成 128 人死亡，美国联邦航空局 (FAA) 最终接管了全国范围内的责任。我的母亲讨厌坐飞机，多年来尽最大努力让她的孩子们避免乘坐飞机，这并不奇怪。<br><br>如果我读<em>《生活》</em>是为了寻找我成年生活的模式，我会很难找到很多关于未来的令人鼓舞的内容。每三到四张封面都会出现一位女性的迷人照片——几乎总是一位知名或新兴的电影明星：泡泡浴中的雪莱·温特斯、“可爱的莉兹·泰勒”、秋千上的琼·柯林斯、索菲亚·罗兰、奥黛丽·赫本、金·诺瓦克。这样的生活显然是遥不可及的——在我看来，这样的生活也没什么意义。其他类型的关于女性的故事很少，而且绝大多数反映了对美国女性正在成为什么样的人的不安。 1955年，一篇题为“每周工作80小时”的文章将家庭主妇描述为美国“最大、工作最努力、收入最低的职业群体”。文章中的中产阶级白人女性并没有公开抱怨自己的负担，但她的话语传达了一种令人震惊的绝望。 “我只是希望我能去一次长途旅行，”她说。<br><br> 1956 年 12 月， <em>《生活》</em>杂志出版了双联特刊《美国妇女：她的成就与烦恼》。焦点再次集中在中产阶级白人女性身上，开场故事讲述了美国“美女”，她们称赞自己来自“许多种族血统”——比如德国人和斯堪的纳维亚人。一位撰稿人总结道，战后美国女性享受的新自由造成了“情感和心理问题”的“反作用”。正如该期社论所指出的那样，“美国女性经常被讨论……作为她自己和他人的问题。”<em>生活</em>似乎比贝蒂·弗里丹的经典著作<em>《女性的奥秘》</em>早了近十年。<br><br>我希望童年时的自己在翻阅这本杂志时跳过了这些故事。他们只能让我充满恐惧。不过，也许我停下来看一篇文章，它传达了更鼓舞人心的信息，并与我后来的生活直接相关：“女性思想的艰难训练场；布林莫尔为女孩们设定了很高的目标。”文章称，该学院提供“美国所有大学中最密集的智力培训”。近十年后，布林莫尔学院为我提供了一条生命线。<br><br>从很多方面来说， <em>《生活》杂志</em>向女性提供这样的认可，尤其是承认她们的不满，都是非常具有前瞻性的。一位心怀不满的读者批评编辑竟然讨论了这个话题。 “呸！世界形势就是这样……你把<em>《生活》</em>的 172 页都写满了女性。”事实上， <em>《生活》杂志</em>经常在数十个页面上充斥着女性——在杂志上刊登的广告中推销汽车、电器、美容产品和时尚。当然，这些女性并不是心怀不满的家庭主妇，而是热情的消费者。这样的一幅肖像比任何探究性别神话表面之下的努力更容易吸引<em>《生活</em>》杂志的读者。<br><br>整个 20 世纪 50 年代， <em>《生活》杂志</em>上无数的广告展示了裹着腰带的女性——就像 Playtex 的“Magic-Controller”恰如其分——并以精心设计的胸罩以及 1952 年首次推出的名为“Merry Widow”的恶魔装置为特色。这个装置从胸部一直延伸到腰带顶部，确保没有任何肉体能够逃脱适当的紧身胸衣的约束。曾作为美国外交政策口号出现的“遏制”原则似乎在女性时尚中也有其对应物。男人的身体不受这样的束缚，但他们“不守规矩”的头发却需要注意。维塔利斯护发剂有望恢复秩序，将其油涂抹在卷发或风吹的头发上。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/06/advertising-1970s-womens-movement/395897/">阅读：“宝贝，你已经走了很长一段路”：广告与女权主义之间的滞后</a><br><br>1955 年，淡粉色被称为“时尚界最喜爱的颜色”，它无处不在：汽车、炉灶、打字机、洗衣机、冰箱、厕所、浴缸。玛米·艾森豪威尔是粉色最伟大的拥护者，她将粉色引入了白宫——“第一夫人粉色”是一种特殊的色调——以及她自己葛底斯堡房子的管道装置。在我看来，粉色是女孩们脆弱、甜美、无关紧要的颜色。与腰带或风流寡妇没什么不同，粉色似乎是为了包容。<br><br> <em>《生活</em>》的广告版面是对美国、它的富足和它的自满的广告。该杂志的许多新闻内容也反映了自满情绪。该杂志社论称，20 世纪 50 年代的美国人“对自己非常满意”。但《美国<em>生活》</em>针对和描绘了哪些人呢？我在 20 世纪 50 年代见过的数百个<em>生活</em>广告中，除了用银托盘提供饮料的管家外，每个人都是白人。<br><br>该杂志的新闻报道更加多样化。<em>生活中</em>经常出现黑人运动员和艺人。玛丽安·安德森、西德尼·波蒂埃、哈里·贝拉方特、WC·汉迪、弗洛伊德·帕特森、比尔·拉塞尔、舒格·雷·罗宾逊、阿尔西娅·吉布森和威利·梅斯占据了上世纪中叶美国白人开始承认黑人成就的类别。在这十年中，该杂志也开始报道其他美国黑人，但这些故事既不是赞赏也不是庆祝。相反，他们关注的是通常被称为“黑人问题”的问题——黑人如何构成美国生活的危机，以及对该杂志一贯强调的美国民主和繁荣的理想化形象的挑战。<br><br>从 1954 年最高法院对<em>布朗诉教育委员会</em>一案的裁决开始， <em>《生活》杂志</em>就表现出了对民权运动的坚定支持，尽管它试图在不断升级的全国性种族辩论中表达不同的立场。南方白人反对融合或认为联邦法院不应强制融合的声音受到了认真关注。 <em>《生活》杂志</em>甚至邀请威廉·福克纳来警告全国：“现在慢慢来。停下来一会儿，一会儿。”福克纳观察到，南方白人“在自己的土地上面临着过时的问题，只有他才能治愈。”但<em>《生活</em>》所珍视的客观性和不偏不倚的态度似乎与对黑人进步和平等的明确承诺一起出现，这在社论和新闻内容中都很明显。从1954年到1956年， <em>《生活》</em>发表了46篇有关民权的文章，占杂志的160页。这些内容绝大多数记录了黑人努力推进融合的故事，以及随之而来的白人对残酷和暴力的强烈抵制——从种族主义校园嘲讽到爆炸、殴打和私刑。<br><br> 1956 年，该杂志出版了由五部分组成的关于种族隔离的系列文章，封面插图描绘了战前查尔斯顿的奴隶拍卖，引人注目且令人不安。 <em>《生活</em>》对这个国家过去的描述在其时代背景和中庸身份的背景下都非常关键。该杂志避免对美国种族历史进行任何浪漫化或净化化的版本。令人不安的关于这个国家过去的肖像包括南北战争期间南方联盟射杀受伤的黑人囚犯的插图、1873 年路易斯安那州科尔法克斯大屠杀中白人屠杀寻求政治权利的黑人的插图，以及 20 世纪初一张黑人被活活烧死的可怕照片。一群嘲笑的白人<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/membership/archive/2018/04/the-magazine-and-martin-luther-king/557222/">阅读：杂志和马丁·路德·金</a><br><br>这些并不是那个时代的历史书中经常讲述的故事。但它们的图像吸引了我的注意力，因为它们描绘的世界与我从小就吸收的仁慈的白人家长式作风和优雅的种族和谐的叙述截然不同。它们与<em>《生活</em>》杂志对 20 世纪 50 年代美国“国内太平”的普遍看法形成鲜明对比。像这样的矛盾以及由此产生的否认促使我质疑我周围世界的假设以及我所学到的教训。我开始憎恨那些误导我的人的盲目性甚至恶意。这在我写给德怀特·艾森豪威尔总统的信中产生了愤慨和惊讶的语气——“先生。”艾森豪威尔，”我在 1957 年用三孔笔记本纸称呼他。“我今年九岁，我是白人，但我对种族隔离有很多感受。”信的开头是这样的——当我几年后找到这封信时，我发现了这一点。位于堪萨斯州阿比林的艾森豪威尔总统档案馆中。 “艾森豪威尔先生，”我恳求道，“请尝试让学校和其他机构接受有色人种。”我怎么可能不知道为什么我的学校都是白色的？当如此可怕的不公正现象不仅存在，而且常常是由同一群口中宣扬公民和宗教虔诚的人大力捍卫时，我怎么能学到美国民主和基督教之爱的理想呢？<br><br><em>生活</em>不仅仅是讲述遥远的过去。在 20 世纪 50 年代中期，该杂志几乎每一期都以令人震惊的照片和文字向读者展示一系列新的暴行，以及我的父母或老师从未提及的事件。故事描述了 1955 年埃米特·蒂尔 (Emmet Till) 被谋杀、1959 年麦克·帕克 (Mack Parker) 被私刑处决，以及小石城、夏洛特、格林维尔甚至邻近我们县的弗吉尼亚县对寻求融入学校的黑人学生的袭击。在<em>《生活</em>》的页面中，我遇到了与我年龄相仿的黑人男孩和女孩，其中包括一些寻求在离我家不远的学校上学的人。我可以看到黑人孩子，有时甚至比我还小，勇敢地面对愤怒的暴徒，因为他们夺取了我认为理所当然的权利。<br><br><em>生活</em>向我展示了千里之外的 1956 年革命中匈牙利儿童冒着生命危险的照片。书籍让我认识了其他时代、其他地方的“敢于冒险的女孩”。但现在，我这一代的孩子们，我所在的弗吉尼亚州的孩子们，正在创造他们自己的英雄故事。并不是蒙哥马利公车抵制运动、麦克·帕克私刑或 1957 年华盛顿自由祈祷朝圣活动——所有这些都在<em>《生活》杂志</em>上得到了充分报道——促使我写信给艾森豪威尔。这是学校整合。我认同并同情这些女孩和男孩。从很多方面来说，20 世纪 50 年代和 60 年代的民权运动起源于“儿童十字军”，后来当儿童（有些年仅 6 岁或 7 岁）充斥伯明翰的街道和监狱时，民权领袖明确使用了这一名称。 1963年夏天，阿拉巴马州。五年前，这些年轻人寻求正义的勇气既激励了我，又让我充满了清醒的责任感。<br><br>我读的不仅仅是故事。这是关于如何可能——甚至是必要——过一种生活。<br><br><em>本文改编自德鲁·吉尔平·浮士德 (Drew Gilpin Faust) 的著作《</em> <a data-event-element="inline link"

class="smallcaps">引人注目的时刻</span>发生在克拉伦斯·托马斯法官和科坦吉·布朗·杰克逊法官之间的正面冲突中，他们在本任期的重大平权行动决定中都对对方的意见表示蔑视。<br><br>但这不是一场一对一的比赛。<br><br>那天，另一个黑人的声音在最高法院回响，他是最高法院历史上唯一的另一位黑人法官：瑟古德·马歇尔。<br><br>在他去世三十年后，他的观点仍然存在。正是他在近 50 年前关于平权行动合宪性的论证为随后有关该问题的所有法律辩论奠定了基础。<br><br>在我作为记者的五十年里，我有幸与马歇尔和托马斯谈论他们的法律哲学以及法律应如何解决种族不平等问题，我写的传记《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/thurgood-marshall-american-revolutionary-juan-williams/9780812932997?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>瑟古德·马歇尔：美国革命</em></a>》现在正在庆祝今年已经是第 25 个年头了。我听到马歇尔的声音在今年夏天的平权行动决定中的两种不同意见中回响，一个来自杰克逊，另一个来自最高法院唯一的拉丁裔法官索尼娅·索托马约尔。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/court-ketanji-brown-jackson-knew/627096/">琳达·格林豪斯：科坦吉·布朗·杰克逊知道的宫廷</a><br><br>杰克逊和索托马约尔在马歇尔的立场上建立了自己的观点——平权行动是一项引人注目的国家利益，对于培育一个成功的、种族多元化的社会是必要的。马歇尔<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/438/265/#F4/1">认为</a>，对少数族裔的种族优惠在法律上是允许的，因为宪法此前给予了占多数的白人优惠，同时让被奴役的黑人“被剥夺了所有合法权利”。<br><br>索托马约尔和杰克逊以 6-3 落败；最高法院的五名白人保守派人士也加入了托马斯的行列。然而，在有色人种法官中，托马斯是唯一的佼佼者，索托马约尔和杰克逊都反对他——还有马歇尔，如果他的持久存在可以投票的话。<br><br> 1978 年，在<span class="smallcaps">考虑</span>第一个平权行动案件<em>“加州大学董事会诉巴克</em>案”时，马歇尔给他的全白人同事写了一份备忘录，告诉他们不要再争论黑人取得的成就是否意味着黑人已经“到来”。 ”他引用<em>《美国新闻与世界报道》</em>列出的 83 名美国领导人的名单说，这种争论是浪费时间。他指出，“即使是潜在的亚军，也没有一个黑人”出现在名单上。<br><br>当我有一次问他关于平权行动应该帮助所有弱势学生（包括贫穷的白人）的想法时，马歇尔告诉我，“这个国家没有一个白人可以说，‘我从未因身为白人而受益。’”<br><br>马歇尔未能让他的法官同事们允许为具有学术资格的少数族裔学生保留戴维斯医学院的 16 个席位。白人多数裁定，这样做相当于种族配额，并且违宪。但马歇尔让他们同意，为了创建一个更加多元化的校园，考虑申请人的种族是合法的。<br><br>在随后对平权行动的所有挑战中，高等法院都必须与马歇尔的前提进行斗争。大法官们必须面对这样一个事实：之前允许奴隶制的宪法也根据第十四修正案的平等保护条款，为弥补最初伤害的法律措施留出了空间。<br><br>他的论点具有足够的说服力，直到今年才得以成立，当时托马斯的观点——平权行动从来不需要来修复过去的种族错误——获得了胜利。<br><br>杰克逊对托马斯反对平权行动的论点的拒绝显然激怒了这位高级黑人法官。托马斯的情感之深显而易见，他决定在法官同事面前大声宣读他的同意意见，这是他担任法官三十年来第一次。 “根据肤色区别对待任何人都是压迫，”托马斯说。在他看来，他继续以个人的方式面对杰克逊， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_l6gn.pdf">写道</a>：“在她看来，我们都无情地陷入了一个根本上的种族主义社会，奴隶制的原罪和美国黑人的历史压迫仍然决定着我们的生活。”今天。”他后来补充道，“杰克逊法官利用她对种族之间统计关系的广泛观察以及对健康、财富和福祉的选择衡量标准，将所有黑人标记为受害者。她这样做的愿望对我来说是难以理解的。”<br><br>正如纽约大学法学教授梅丽莎·穆雷 (Melissa Murray) 对<em>《纽约时报》</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/us/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson.html">所说</a>，托马斯听起来就像“一位黑人长辈在斥责和惩罚一位犯错的青年土耳其党人，而他……未能表现出足够的尊重。就好像他期待杰克逊的种族团结一样。<br><br>托马斯似乎在让杰克逊远离马歇尔方面投入了感情。长期以来，他一直认为平权行动在学校和职业生活中使黑人蒙上了耻辱。他认为，由于平权行动，白人认为他们的黑人同龄人资质较差，甚至智力较低。<br><br> “如果我……[从事与种族相关的工作]，我的职业生涯将被无可挽回地毁掉，”托马斯在 1980 年<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/02/a-question-of-fairness/306370/">告诉我</a>，讽刺的是，他在担任平等就业机会委员会领导人之前说道。 “猴子会骑在我背上，证明我没有这份工作，因为我是黑人。第一次见到我的人会自然而然地认为我的想法是二流的。”<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/02/a-question-of-fairness/306370/">摘自1987年2月号：公平问题</a><br><br>他认为白人的屈尊俯就是对所有黑人的终生侮辱。他希望杰克逊和他一起谴责平权行动，将其视为侮辱的一部分，因为在他看来，平权行动本质上否定了黑人的平等智力和纪律。<br><br>托马斯论点最尖锐的一点是，白人对黑人的唯一义务是遵守“法律”——正如他所认为的——并确保宪法对平等权利的保护现在到位。他从未谈到过几代人在教育、就业、社会资本和增加家庭财富的机会方面的损失。他在长达 58 页的同意书中用大部分内容驳斥了这些因素，认为这些因素没有法律依据。<br><br>几年前，在接受<em>《大西洋月刊》</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/02/a-question-of-fairness/306370/">采访时</a>，托马斯向我讲述了他童年时期的一个故事，讲述了一场二十一点游戏，其中一名玩家被发现是作弊者。他说，到那时，弄清楚谁被骗了、谁合法损失了钱就毫无道理了。游戏继续进行的唯一方法是每个人都同意停止作弊——这将使其成为一个公平的竞争环境。<br><br>托马斯的论点植根于他心目中的英雄布克·T·华盛顿、马库斯·加维和马尔科姆·X 的挑衅黑人民族主义传统。在他著名的“亚特兰大妥协”演讲中，华盛顿支持黑人和白人保持社会隔离的想法，“像手指一样分开”，这样他们就可以继续做生意。当一位白人自由主义者问马尔科姆·艾克斯她能做些什么来帮助黑人进步时，他的著名回答是：“什么也做不了。”<br><br>托马斯同样认为，只有白人不妨碍黑人并停止推行平权行动等计划，黑人才能展示自己的能力。然而，托马斯和大多数黑人民族主义者之间的巨大区别在于，他向白人保证，他们对奴隶制的历史和持续的偏见不承担任何责任。<br><br>托马斯直接表达了对杰克逊的蔑视，谴责她引用黑人和白人统计上不同的结果作为“将所有黑人贴上受害者标签”的企图。他认为，她会将黑人置于“看似永久的劣等种姓”。<br><br>杰克逊并不买账。她在脚注中回应了她的异议，称是托马斯，而不是她，“表现出了对种族意识的痴迷，远远超出了我的[论点]……种族可能是影响申请人独特生活经历的一个因素。”<br><br>根据马歇尔大法官的想法，她写道，托马斯本质上被锁在种族扭曲的镜像大厅里。她说，他要求美国人不要把目光从“房间里的大象——与种族相关的差异上移开，这种差异继续阻碍我们国家充分发挥潜力”。杰克逊认为，允许大学考虑申请者的种族对于促进平等具有“普遍好处”。<br><br>至于托马斯声称平权行动导致所有黑人都被贴上受害者的标签，杰克逊表示，这种逻辑失败了，因为它“以数不胜数的方式<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/opinion/ketanji-brown-jackson-blink.html">忽视了</a>历史和现实……我们的国家从来都不是色盲的。”<br><br>索托马约尔法官与杰克逊一样，在法官席上表示托马斯的论点是错误的。 “忽视种族不会使种族不平等的社会变得平等，”她说。 “无论是 1860 年代还是 1954 年，今天都是如此：平等需要承认不平等。”<br><br>这与马歇尔多年来的论点相符。已故法官对<em>Bakke 案</em>中多数意见的部分持不同意见，即拒绝接受更广泛的平权行动观点，这将允许配额：“必须记住，在过去 200 年的大部分时间里，宪法被解释为该法院的裁决并没有禁止对黑人最巧妙和最普遍形式的歧视。现在，当国家采取行动补救歧视遗留的影响时，我无法相信同一部宪法会成为障碍。”尽管如此，马歇尔的逻辑仍然允许考虑种族因素——直到今年的决定。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">早在来到最高法院之前</span>，托马斯就主张不应将平等与融合混为一谈。<br><br>托马斯在 1987 年<em>《霍华德法律杂志》</em>上的一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/howlj30&amp;div=69&amp;id=&amp;page=">文章</a>中指出，在 1954 年<em>布朗诉教育委员会</em>一致宣布学校种族隔离为非法的判决中，法院根据课堂种族隔离所造成的社会学主张做出的裁决是错误的，正如该<a data-event-element="inline link"

，黑人学生中存在一种“自卑感”，因此“本质上是不平等的”。相反，他说，<em>布朗</em>应该转向“自由和平等的首要原则”，正如约翰·马歇尔·哈伦法官对 1896 年<em>普莱西诉弗格森</em>案判决中的异议所体现的那样。他说，对学校融合的关注导致国家陷入了数十年的“关于‘配额’、‘平权行动’以及针对社会弊病的种族意识补救措施的琐碎争论。”<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/rbc/lcrbmrp/t0e02/t0e02.pdf">写道</a>，白人“在看到我们在所有活动和成就、文化和道德宏伟方面与他们完全平等时，将被迫忘记所有种族事实和理论。”同样，伊斯兰国家领导人伊利亚·穆罕默德也曾批评马歇尔对种族融合的法律诉求是对黑人的侮辱。<br><br>当马歇尔作为一名律师在法庭上赢得了具有里程碑意义的<em>布朗</em>判决时，穆罕默德谴责他“寻求奴隶与其主人之间更密切的关系，这将导致明智的老奴隶主的孩子们对黑人的彻底毁灭” ……瑟古德·马歇尔并不关心他的同类或黑人民族的认可。他爱上了白人。他讨厌宣扬黑人民族的进步，除非得到白人的认可。”<br><br>未来的法官托马斯使用与伊斯兰国家领导人相同的逻辑，认为以马歇尔为倡导者的全国有色人种协进会应该要求法院为所有儿童提供优质教育，而不是融合。<br><br>我曾经向马歇尔大法官本人提出过托马斯的论点。我刚刚完成了<em>《华盛顿邮报》</em><em>杂志</em>对马歇尔的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1990/01/07/marshalls-law/eea56d1a-2dd6-48e3-b6de-2493e66d25d2/">简介</a>，并回访了他在法院的房间。那是 1990 年，在<em>布朗大学</em>毕业 30 多年后，大城市的学校基本上仍然是种族隔离的——这是贫困黑人学生在白人逃往郊区学校后的堡垒。<br><br>尽管如此，马歇尔告诉我托马斯错了。<br><br>马歇尔<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2004-05-16-0405140032-story.html">表示，</a>他主张学校实行种族融合，以迫使白人学校董事会、白人市长和白人州长为所有学校提供平等的服务，因为白人儿童可以在所有学校就读。他说，他并不是为了拍摄一张教室里黑人和白人孩子微笑的照片。但在他看来，让黑人孩子和白人孩子在同一间教室是确保他们拥有相同教育机会的唯一途径。<br><br>两位黑人法官从未面对面辩论过这个问题。但托马斯从未停止想要在球场上战胜他取代的那个人。在最近这场关于这个问题的争论中，在我看来，他特别想赢得杰克逊对他在辩论中的支持，向世界，特别是黑人世界表明，他是对的。他似乎渴望得到黑人的肯定，他认为白人自由主义批评者将黑人与他分开。 He once <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/499401-juan-williams-justice-thomas-seizes-his-moment-in-the-trump-era/">told</a> me that when he met with a Black student group and outlined his conservative positions to lift up Black America, the meeting ended with a young Black man telling him, “Man, they lied on you.” Thomas told me that story to show that when Black people see him for themselves, they give him the love and racial solidarity he so desperately seeks.<br><br> Not just Justice Jackson, but close to half of Black America agrees with Marshall&#39;s view that affirmative action&#39;s consideration of race was a legitimate tool for university admissions. According to a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/16/americans-and-affirmative-action-how-the-public-sees-the-consideration-of-race-in-college-admissions-hiring/">Pew Research Center poll</a> done this year, 47 percent of Black people supported the idea, 29 percent did not, and 24 percent were undecided.<br><br> Recently, Keith Ellison, Minnesota&#39;s attorney general, a Black man, suggested that Thomas was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4102079-minnesota-ag-compares-clarence-thomas-to-house-slave-in-django-unchained/">comparable</a> to a character in the 2012 movie <em>Django Unchained</em> . Samuel L. Jackson plays a house slave who remains loyal to an enslaver despite witnessing his brutal cruelty against Black people. “Clarence Thomas has decided that his best personal interest is siding with the powerful … regardless of who they are going to hurt,” Ellison said. Similarly, when the Georgia Senate voted last year to build a monument to Thomas, the state&#39;s native son, the measure was opposed by Black state senators. “It&#39;s not that we have a problem that he is a conservative or a Republican,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/hypocrite-traitor-georgia-black-lawmakers-133000692.html">said</a> State Senator Nikki Merritt, who is Black. “We think he&#39;s a hypocrite and a traitor. It seems like white America keeps wanting to promote Justice Thomas, but we see more evidence where time and time again he subverts the struggles of Black Americans.”<br><br> Thomas, who set out to defeat Marshall, has not succeeded. The power of Marshall&#39;s voice on the current Court, in the form of Jackson&#39;s and Sotomayor&#39;s dissent, showed that Thomas&#39;s views did not carry the day with Black Americans.<br><br> Though Thomas spoke from the bench, it is Marshall&#39;s voice that still resonates.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/thurgood-marshall-clarence-thomas-black-justice-scotus/674975/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/thurgood-marshall-clarence-thomas-black-justice-scotus/674975/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Problem With ‘Centering Blackness’ in Everyday Conversations]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> On good and bad color-blindness <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Qp4jKZOJ76oF_x9lo5nx8Y0DP3I=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/blackness_language_horz/original.jpg" alt="两个语音气泡，一个人在重叠空间中的轮廓" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> The hotel was soulless, like all conference hotels. I had arrived a few hours before check-in, hoping to drop off my bags before I met a friend for lunch. The employees were clearly frazzled, overwhelmed by the sudden influx of several hundred impatient academics. When I asked where I could put my luggage, the guy at the front desk simply pointed to a nearby hallway. “Wait over there with her; he&#39;s coming back.”<br><br> Who “he” was remained unclear, but I saw the woman he was referring to. She was white and about my age. She had a conference badge and a large suitcase that she was rolling back and forth in obvious exasperation. “Been waiting long?” I asked, taking up a position on the other side of the narrow hallway. “ <i>Very</i> ,” she replied. For a while, we stood in silence, minding our phones. Eventually, we began chatting.<br><br> The conversation was wide-ranging: the papers we were presenting, the bad A/V at the hotel, our favorite things to do in the city. At some point, we began talking about our jobs. She told me that— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/upshot/academic-job-crisis-phd.html">like so many academics</a> —she was juggling a temporary teaching gig while also looking for a tenure-track position.<br><br> “It&#39;s hard,” she said, “too many classes, too many students, too many papers to grade. No time for your own work. Barely any time to apply to <i>real</i> jobs.”<br><br> When I nodded sympathetically, she asked about my job and whether it was tenure-track. I admitted, a little sheepishly, that it was.<br><br> “I&#39;d love to teach at a small college like that,” she said. “I feel like none of my students wants to learn. It&#39;s exhausting.”<br><br> Then, out of nowhere, she said something that caught me completely off guard: “But I shouldn&#39;t be complaining to you about this. I know <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/10/21/scholars-talk-about-being-black-campus-2020">how hard</a> BIPOC faculty have it. You&#39;re the last person I should be whining to.”<br><br> I was taken aback, but I shouldn&#39;t have been. It was the kind of awkward comment I&#39;ve grown used to over the past few years, as “anti-racism” has become the reigning ideology of progressive political culture. Until recently, calling attention to a stranger&#39;s race in such a way would have been considered a social faux pas. That she made the remark without thinking twice—a remark, it should be noted, that assumes being a Black tenure-track professor is <i>worse</i> than being a marginally employed white one—shows how profoundly interracial social etiquette has changed since 2020&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/16/902179773/summer-of-racial-reckoning-the-match-lit">“summer of racial reckoning.”</a> That&#39;s when anti-racism—focused on combating “color-blindness” in both policy and personal conduct—grabbed ahold of the liberal mainstream.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/tyre-nichols-death-memphis-george-floyd-police-reform/672986/">Wesley Lowery: Why there was no racial reckoning</a><br><br> Though this “reckoning” brought increased public attention to the deep embeddedness of racism in supposedly color-blind American institutions, it also made instant celebrities of a number of race experts and “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) consultants who believe that being anti-racist means undergoing a<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gsb-sites.stanford.edu/anti-racism-and-allyship/">“journey”</a> of radical personal transformation. In their righteous crusade against the bad color-blindness of policies such as race-neutral college admissions, these contemporary anti-racists have also jettisoned the kind of <i>good</i> color-blindness that holds that we are more than our race, and that we should conduct our social life according to that idealized principle. Rather than balance a critique of color-blind law and policy with a continuing embrace of interpersonal color-blindness as a social etiquette, contemporary anti-racists throw the baby out with the bathwater. In place of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/actually-color-blindness-isnt-racist">the old color-blind ideal</a> , they have foisted upon well-meaning white liberals a successor social etiquette predicated on the necessity of foregrounding racial difference rather than minimizing it.<br><br> As a Black guy who grew up in a politically purple area—where being a good person meant adhering to the kind of civil-rights-era color-blindness that is now passé—I find this emergent anti-racist culture jarring. Many of my liberal friends and acquaintances now seem to believe that being a good person means constantly reminding Black people that you are aware of their Blackness. Difference, no longer to be politely ignored, is insisted upon at all times under the guise of acknowledging “positionality.” Though I am rarely made to feel excessively aware of my race when hanging out with more conservative friends or visiting my hometown, in the more liberal social circles in which I typically travel, my race is constantly invoked—“acknowledged” and “centered”—by well-intentioned anti-racist “allies.”<br><br> This “acknowledgement” tends to take one of two forms. The first is the song and dance in which white people not-so-subtly let <i>you</i> know that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/opinion/not-a-racist.html"><i>they</i> know that race and racism exist</a> . This includes finding ways to interject discussion of some (bad) news item about race or racism into casual conversation, apologizing for having problems while white (“You&#39;re the last person I should be whining to”), or inversely, offering “support” by attributing any normal human problem <i>you</i> have to racism.<br><br> The second way good white liberals often “center” racial difference in everyday interactions with minorities is by trying, always clumsily, to ensure that their “marginalized” friends and familiars are “culturally” comfortable. My favorite personal experiences of this include an acquaintance who invariably steers dinner or lunch meetups to Black-owned restaurants, and the time that a friend of a friend invited me over to go swimming in their pool before apologizing for assuming that I know how to swim (“I know that&#39;s a culturally specific thing”). It is a peculiar quirk of the 2020s&#39; racial discourse that this kind of “acknowledgement” and “centering” is viewed as progress.<br><br> My point is not that conservatives have better racial politics— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/08/07/opinion/florida-board-education-slavery-nazism/">they do not</a> —but rather that something about current progressive racial discourse has become warped and distorted. The anti-racist culture that is ascendant seems to me to have little to do with combatting structural racism or cultivating better relationships between white and Black Americans. And its rejection of color-blindness as a social ethos is not a new frontier of radical political action.<br><br> No, at the core of today&#39;s anti-racism is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/15/black-lives-matter-george-floyd-protests-policy-change/">little more than a vibe shift</a> —a soft matrix of conciliatory gestures and hip phraseology that give adherents the <i>feeling</i> that there has been a cultural change, when in fact we have merely put carpet over the rotting floorboards. Although this push to center rather than sidestep racial difference in our interpersonal relationships comes from a good place, it tends to rest on a troubling, even racist subtext: that white and Black Americans are so radically different that interracial relationships require careful management, constant eggshell-walking, and even expert guidance from professional anti-racists. Rather than producing racial harmony, this new ethos frequently has the opposite effect, making white-Black interactions stressful, unpleasant, or, perhaps most often, simply weird.<br><br> Since the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, progressive anti-racism has centered on two concepts that helped Americans make sense of his senseless death: “structural racism” and “implicit bias.” The first of these is a sociopolitical concept that highlights how certain institutions— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/12/upshot/child-maternal-mortality-rich-poor.html">maternity wards</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/16/us/minneapolis-police-george-floyd">police barracks</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/08/25/the-secret-bias-hidden-in-mortgage-approval-algorithms">lending companies</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-settlement-race-discrimination-lawsuit-against-public-housing">housing authorities</a> , etc.—produce and replicate racial inequalities, such as the disproportionate killing of Black men by the cops. The second is a psychological<i> </i>concept that describes the way that all individuals—from bleeding-heart liberals to murderers such as Derek Chauvin—harbor varying degrees of subconscious racial prejudice.<br><br> Though “structural racism” and “implicit bias” target different scales of the social order—institutions on the one hand, individuals on the other—underlying both of these ideas is a critique of so-called color-blind ideology, or what the sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva calls “color-blind racism”: the idea that policies, interactions, and rhetoric can be explicitly race-neutral but implicitly racist. As concepts, both “structural racism” and “implicit bias” rest on the presupposition that racism is an enduring feature of institutional and social life, and that so-called race neutrality is a covertly racist myth that perpetuates inequality. Some anti-racist scholars such as Uma Mazyck Jayakumar and Ibram X. Kendi have put this even more bluntly: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/supreme-court-affirmative-action-race-neutral-admissions/674565/">“&#39;Race neutral&#39; is the new “separate but equal.&#39;”</a> Yet, although anti-racist academics and activists are <i>right</i> to argue that race-neutral policies can&#39;t solve racial inequities—that supposedly color-blind laws and policies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/colorblind-constitution/602221/">are often anything but</a> —over the past few years, this line of criticism has also been bizarrely extended to color-blindness as a <i>personal</i> ethos governing behavior at the individual level.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/colorblind-constitution/602221/">Theodore R. Johnson: How conservatives turned the &#39;color-blind constitution&#39; against racial progress</a><br><br> The most famous proponent of dismantling color-blindness in everyday interactions is Robin DiAngelo, who has made an entire (very <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/dehumanizing-condescension-white-fragility/614146/">condescending</a> ) career out of asserting that if white people are not uncomfortable, anti-racism is not happening. “White comfort maintains the racial status quo, so discomfort is necessary and important,” the corporate anti-racist guru <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/white-fragility-why-it-s-so-hard-for-white-people-to-talk-about-racism-robin-diangelo/9780807047415?affiliate_id=atl-347">advises</a> . Over the past three years, this kind of anti-color-blind, pro-discomfort rhetoric has become the norm in anti-racist discourse. On the final day of the 28-day challenge in Layla Saad&#39;s viral <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blm.btown-in.org/uploads/1/1/8/6/118615243/me_and_white_supremacy_workbook__final_book_.pdf"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/me-and-white-supremacy-combat-racism-change-the-world-and-become-a-good-ancestor-layla-saad/9781728232430?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Me and White Supremacy</i></a> , budding anti-racists are tasked with taking “out-of-your-comfort-zone actions,” such as apologizing to people of color in their life and having “uncomfortable conversations.” Frederick Joseph&#39;s best-selling book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/books/review/frederick-joseph-the-black-friend.html"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-black-friend-on-being-a-better-white-person-frederick-joseph/9781536223040?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Black Friend</i></a> takes a similar tack. The problem with color-blindness, Joseph counsels, is it allows “white people to continue to be comfortable.” The NFL analyst Emmanuel Acho wrote an entire book, simply called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/uncomfortable-conversations-with-a-black-man-emmanuel-acho/9781250800473?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man</i></a> , that admonishes readers to “stop celebrating color-blindness.” And, of course, there are endless <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/real-friends-talk-about-race-yseult-p-mukantabanahannah-summerhill?variant=40582692667426"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/real-friends-talk-about-race-bridging-the-gaps-through-uncomfortable-conversations-yseult-p-mukantabana/9780778387053?affiliate_id=atl-347">how-to guides</a> for having these “uncomfortable conversations” with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://katiecouric.com/lifestyle/relationships/how-to-talk-about-racism/">your Black friends</a> .<br><br> Once the dominant progressive ideology, professing “I don&#39;t see color” is now viewed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danabrownlee/2022/06/19/dear-white-people-when-you-say-you-dont-see-color-this-is-what-we-really-hear/?sh=b4c50c726d60">as a kind of dog whistle</a> that papers over implicit bias. Instead, current anti-racist wisdom holds that we must acknowledge racial difference in our interactions with others, rather than assume that race needn&#39;t be at the center of every interracial conversation or encounter. Coming to grips with the transition we have undergone over the past decade—color-blind etiquette&#39;s swing from de rigueur to racist—requires a longer view of an American cultural transition. Civil-rights-era color-blindness was replaced with an individualistic, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/how-to-build-an-anti-racist-company">corporatized anti-racism</a> , one focused on the purification of white psyches through racial discomfort, guilt, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/07/protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-wokeness/">“doing the work”</a> as a road to self-improvement.<br><br> Writing in 1959, the social critic Philip Rieff argued that postwar America was transforming from a religious and economic culture—one oriented around common institutions such as the church and the market—to a <i>psychological</i> culture, one oriented around the self and its emotional fulfillment. By the 1960s, Rieff had given this shift a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Therapeutic-Background-Essential-Conservative/dp/1932236805">name</a> : “the triumph of the therapeutic,” which he defined as an emergent worldview according to which the “self, improved, is the ultimate concern of modern culture.” Yet, even as he diagnosed our culture with self-obsession, Rieff also noticed something peculiar and even paradoxical. Therapeutic culture demanded that we reflect our self-actualization <i>outward</i> . Sharing our innermost selves with the world—good, bad, and ugly—became a new social mandate under the guise that authenticity and open self-expression are necessary for social cohesion.<br><br> Recent anti-racist mantras like “White silence is violence” reflect this same sentiment: exhibitionist displays of “racist” guilt are viewed as a necessary precursor to racial healing and community building. In this way, today&#39;s attacks on interpersonal color-blindness—and progressives&#39; growing fixation on implicit bias, public confession, and race-conscious social etiquette—are only the most recent manifestations of the cultural shift Rieff described. Indeed, the seeds of the current backlash against color-blindness began decades ago, with the application of a New Age, therapeutic outlook to race relations: so-called racial-sensitivity training, the forefather of today&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/antiracism-training-white-fragility-robin-diangelo-ibram-kendi.html">equally spurious</a> DEI programming.<br><br> In her 2001 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/race-experts-how-racial-etiquette-sensitivity-training-and-new-age-therapy-hijacked-the-civil-rights-revolution-elisabeth-lasch-quinn/9780742527591?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Race Experts</i></a> , the historian Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn painstakingly details how racial-sensitivity training emerged from the 1960s&#39; human-potential movement and its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/encounter-movement-a-fad-last-decade-finds-new-shape-tried-by.html">infamous “encounter groups.”</a> As she explains, what began as a more or less countercultural phenomenon was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-radical-history-of-corporate-sensitivity-training#:~:text=It%2520was%2520born%2520amid%2520the,fears%252C%2520biases%252C%2520and%2520emotions.">later corporatized</a> in the form of the anemic, pointless workshops <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/comedy-central-caves-cancel-culture-removes-episode-office-line-1623873">controversially lampooned on <i>The Office</i></a> . Not surprisingly, this shift <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ideas.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Anand-Winters-2008.pdf">reflected the ebb and flow of corporate interests</a> : Whereas early workplace training emphasized compliance with the newly minted Civil Rights Act of 1964, later incarnations would focus on improving employee relations and, later still, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hbr.org/2022/06/stop-making-the-business-case-for-diversity">leveraging diversity</a> to secure <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/biancamillercole/2020/09/15/8-reasons-why-diversity-and-inclusion-are-essential-to-business-success/?sh=2c9d53581824">better business outcomes</a> .<br><br> If there is something distinctive about the anti-color-blind racial etiquette that has emerged since George Floyd&#39;s death, it is that these sites of encounter have shifted from official institutional spaces to more intimate ones where white people and minorities interact as friends, neighbors, colleagues, and acquaintances. Racial-awareness raising is a dynamic no longer quarantined to formalized, compulsory settings like the boardroom or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2963111">freshman orientation</a> . Instead, every interracial interaction is a potential scene of (one-way) racial edification and supplication, encounters in which good white liberals are expected to be transparent about their “positionality,” confront their “whiteness,” and—if the situation calls for it—confess their “implicit bias.”<br><br> In a vacuum, many of the prescriptions advocated by the anti-color-blind crowd are reasonable: We <i>should</i> all think more about our privileges and our place in the world. An uncomfortable conversation or an honest look in the mirror <i>can be</i> precursors to personal growth. We <i>all</i> carry around harmful, implicit biases and we <i>do</i> need to examine the subconscious assumptions and prejudices that underlie the actions we take and the things we say. My objection is not to these ideas themselves, which are sensible enough. No, my objection is that anti-racism offers little more than a Marie Kondo–ism for the white soul, promising to declutter racial baggage and clear a way to white fulfillment without doing anything meaningful to combat structural racism. As Lasch-Quinn correctly foresaw, “Casting interracial problems as issues of etiquette [puts] a premium on superficial symbols of good intentions and good motivations as well as on style and appearance rather than on the substance of change.”<br><br> Yet the problem with the therapeutics of contemporary anti-racism is not just that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Antiracism.html">they are politically sterile</a> . When anti-color-blindness and its ideology of insistent “race consciousness” are translated into the sphere of private life—to the domain of friendships, block parties, and backyard barbecues—they assault the very idea of a multiracial society, producing new forms of racism in the process. The fact that our media environment is inundated with an endless stream of books, articles, and social-media tutorials that promise to teach white people how to simply <i>interact</i> with the Black people in their life is not a sign of anti-racist progress, but of profound regression.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/dei-training-initiatives-consultants-companies-skepticism/674237/">Conor Friedersdorf: The DEI industry needs to check its privilege</a><br><br> The subtext that undergirds this new anti-racist discourse—that Black-white relationships are inherently fraught and must be navigated with the help of professionals and technical experts—testifies to the impoverishment of our interracial imagination, not to its enrichment. More gravely, anti-color-blind etiquette treats Black Americans as exotic others, permanent strangers whose racial difference is so chasmic that it must be continually managed, whose mode of humanness is so foreign that it requires white people to adopt a special set of manners and “race conscious” ritualistic practices to even have a simple conversation.<br><br> If we are going to find a way out of the racial discord that has defined American life post-Trump and post-Charlottesville and post-Floyd, we have to begin with a more sophisticated understanding of color-blindness, one that rejects the bad color-blindness on offer from the Republican Party and its partisans, as well as the <i>anti</i> -color-blindness of the anti-racist consultants. Instead, we should embrace the good color-blindness of not too long ago. At the heart of <i>that</i> color-blindness was a radical claim, one imperfectly realized but perfect as an ideal: that despite the weight of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88478467">a racist past that isn&#39;t even past</a> , we can imagine a world, or at least an interaction between two people, where racial difference doesn&#39;t make a difference.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/anti-racist-color-blindness-dei-programs/674996/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/anti-racist-color-blindness-dei-programs/674996/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Greatest Act of Greenwashing in American History]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A new chronicle of redwood logging exposes how a cadre of wealthy industrialists reaped a fortune in the name of environmentalism. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/PWfwW2bU-OoNP9ZHmqDfQDMeQVo=/0x0:2160x2700/648x810/media/img/2023/08/11/redwood/original.jpg" alt="红杉" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Delaney Allen</figcaption></figure> I <span class="smallcaps">n 1934, an industrialist</span> and obsessive book collector named A. Edward Newton <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1934/01/a-tourist-in-san-francisco/651802/">wrote an article</a> for <i>The Atlantic</i> recounting a trip he had recently taken to see the ancient redwoods of Northern California. He had traveled by night train to the timber town of Scotia, then by motor car up into the quiet, fog-draped forest. When he finally arrived, Newton did what most writers do when faced with some of the tallest trees on Earth: He experienced a wave of awe, his brain short-circuited, and then he resorted to cliché. In the article, he likens the massive trees to “stone columns in a cathedral.” Then he quotes a line of verse from William Cullen Bryant (who was cribbing, in turn, from Pliny the Elder): “The groves were God&#39;s first temples.” Very large and very old trees tend to have this effect on us—they deepen our souls but impoverish our wits. We can&#39;t quite make sense of them.<br><br> The owner of that ancient forest, the Pacific Lumber Company, had recently battled with conservationists over the right to cut down a nearby swath of old-growth redwoods called Bull Creek Flat. Newton, briefly outlining this conflict in the article, seems torn between his newfound love of the redwoods, which he now regarded as “personal friends,” and his “friends of the Pacific Lumber Company,” who had “a duty toward their stockholders.” Naturally, he was relieved that a compromise had recently been struck: A cadre of wealthy individuals, most notably John D. Rockefeller Jr., had donated millions of dollars to purchase 9,000 acres of old-growth land and fold it into an existing state park. “It was a long pull and a strong pull and a pull all together, but the thing after ten years was done,” Newton writes. “The redwoods were saved and the world is the richer therefor.”<br><br> The author was, it probably goes without saying, wrong: The old-growth redwoods were not saved, at least not in the sense that most people today would interpret that phrase. Yes, some exemplary antique redwoods were protected in museumlike groves, but elsewhere, the majority of the old-growth-redwood ecosystem was rapidly vanishing. More worrying still, it turned out that the trees were not truly protected even in “protected” areas. This fact came thundering home in the winter of 1955, when a flood washed away a clear-cut hillside above Bull Creek Flat—the very forest Newton had deemed “saved”—killing hundreds of giant trees. The notion that we could preserve a few old redwoods without also safeguarding their ecosystem was revealed to be a cruel fantasy.<br><br> As Greg King demonstrates in his groundbreaking new book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-ghost-forest-racists-radicals-and-real-estate-in-the-california-redwoods-greg-king/9781541768673?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Ghost Forest: Racists, Radicals, and Real Estate in the California Redwoods</i></a> ,<i> </i>the history of redwood conservation—and, perhaps, the history of environmentalism itself—is a never-ending series of tempting illusions and hard-won revelations. For more than a century, as loggers continued to raze entire groves that predated the birth of Christopher Columbus (and some that predated the birth of Christ), the public was continually reassured that the trees were in the process of being, or <i>had already been,</i> “saved.”<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n the mid-1980s,</span> while working as a young newspaper reporter, King stumbled across timber companies&#39; plans to cut down the nation&#39;s largest unprotected stands of old-growth redwoods. (One of those forests just happened to be a short walk from his house.) After talking with state regulators—who struck him as apathetic and ecologically misinformed—and visiting the horror show of fresh clear-cuts, he decided to quit his job, hop across the thin inky line between journalism and activism, and join the fight to save the redwoods. In the five years that followed, King climbed high into the branches of trees that were slated to be felled; he organized rallies where he was repeatedly attacked by loggers (King hit back); and, once, he was arrested for scaling the Golden Gate Bridge in order to hang a banner reading <span class="smallcaps">SAVE THIS PLANET</span> . (His friends faced even graver risks: One of his fellow organizers, Judi Bari, was the victim of both a bombing and an attempt by the FBI <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/12/duncancampbell.oliverburkeman">to frame her</a> <i>for transporting that very bomb</i> .)<br><br> If handled poorly, a history of the so-called Redwood Wars—especially when told by one of the aging activists who took part in it—could seem a bit narrow, almost quaint. (Our most urgent environmental concerns these days tend to be planetary and structural, rather than local and sylvan.) King brilliantly avoids this pitfall by expanding the scope of his book. The real story he wants to tell is an epic tale of corruption and deception, perpetrated on a mass scale for nearly a century, of which his crusade constitutes only a few chapters.<br><br> The early history of industrial redwood logging is one of outright theft: Under lax laws such as the Timber and Stone Act, which was intended to encourage new small-scale logging and mining operations, large companies routinely purchased redwood forests at steep discounts by pretending they would be used by individual homesteaders. All told, millions of acres of valuable land were stolen in this fashion.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1901/09/hunting-big-redwoods/544044/">Read: Hunting big redwoods</a><br><br> However, King adds a crucial missing piece to this oft-told history; he explains <i>why</i> that land was so valuable. Before the widespread use of steel, redwood lumber was not just any old wood. It was the very bones of industrial capitalism, at the precise moment in the 19th century when the Golden State was undergoing a growth spurt. Redwood lumber was the principal building material for entire cities, including San Francisco; it provided the most durable ties for the nascent railroad industry; and, perhaps most importantly, it could be fashioned into rot-resistant pipelines and tanks to store and transport water and petroleum. Many of these applications (especially the pipelines) required a specific type of redwood timber—the kind that could be found only in the oldest trees. But strangely, King uncovers, many of the moguls who most needed that rare lumber were the same ones who were supposedly campaigning to “save” the redwoods.<br><br> The most startling section of King&#39;s book concerns his research into the history of the venerable Save the Redwoods League—a conservation group founded in 1918 by, and for a long time largely managed by, wealthy industrialists and prominent eugenicists (the “racists” of the book&#39;s subtitle). Digging through a newly accessible archive containing the league&#39;s private documents, King reports that throughout their history, rather than attempting to preserve large tracts of wild land, as they purported to do, its early members mainly focused on buying up “beauty strips” of old-growth redwoods alongside roadways and railways, which hid the sight of the other trees being liquidated. They repeatedly brokered deals that paid logging companies exorbitant amounts of money for their land—sometimes as much as four times above the estimated market value—and on at least one occasion arrived just in the nick of time to save a lumber company from bankruptcy. Meanwhile, they actively campaigned against other conservation groups who were pushing to protect larger, more intact pieces of wilderness. In doing so, King argues, the league gave industrialists exactly what they wanted: It mollified public outcry while simultaneously guaranteeing industry&#39;s access to nature&#39;s riches. Readers familiar with Eleanor Catton&#39;s new novel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/04/birnam-wood-eleanor-catton-book-review/673668/"><i>Birnam Wood</i></a> ;<i> </i>David O. Russell&#39;s film <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO6EKe8gVXk"><i>I Heart Huckabees</i></a> ;<i> </i>or, really, any oil-industry ad campaign already know how this feat of corporate sleight of hand works. What&#39;s astonishing, in the league&#39;s case, is its duration and success. King dubs its efforts to be “the first, the largest, and the longest-lasting example” of “greenwashing” in history.<br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">f course, as an activist-historian,</span> King has learned to deftly wield illusion to his own ends as well. He elides important shifts in paradigms, such as that from classic conservationism to biocentric preservation and ecological restoration (the difference, in other words, between saving redwoods for their lumber and beauty and saving them for their own sake). He is quick to brand the league with the neat stamp of corruption, when a murkier desire for what seemed like win-win compromises was likely often at play, and he undersells its biggest accomplishments, such as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/apr/22/the-three-telegrams-rohde/">truly Herculean effort</a> to save Bull Creek Flat. The book is also markedly light on self-examination; there is scant mention of any missteps by King and his fellow North Coast activists, nor any exploration of their (by most accounts, refreshingly labor-friendly and nuanced) environmental philosophy. For a more scholarly and evenhanded account of this same history, Darren Frederick Speece&#39;s book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/defending-giants-the-redwood-wars-and-the-transformation-of-american-environmental-politics-darren-frederick-speece/9780295745732?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Defending Giants: The Redwood Wars and the Transformation of American Environmental Politics</i></a> , is worth reading. However, I suspect that most readers will prefer King&#39;s rendition, which, though slanted, glints with a cold, sharp light.<br><br> Near its end, the tone of the book shifts to one of bittersweet ambivalence. In 1999, in a deal brokered in part by Save the Redwoods League, which was still wielding power nearly a century after its founding, the federal government paid almost half a billion dollars to the Pacific Lumber Company in exchange for just 3,000 acres of old-growth forest, which was set aside in the newly designated <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/headwaters-opens-up-the-public-will-soon-be-2942826.php">Headwaters Forest Reserve</a> , as well as an additional 4,000 acres of previously logged land to act as a buffer. Though nominally a victory for King and his allies, the deal was a mere fraction of the 60,000 acres they felt were needed to protect the ecosystem. The combination of new federal and state regulations, court rulings, and public pressure over the past two decades has made the clear-cutting of ancient redwoods (mostly) a thing of the past. But the great dream of preservationists—a complete, protected watershed of ancient redwood giants—was never achieved, anywhere, and now never will be.<br><br> Meanwhile, climate change has begun <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.savetheredwoods.org/what-we-do/our-work/study/understanding-climate-change/">threatening</a> the old-growth redwoods, which rely on now-inconsistent amounts of fog and rain. (Ironically enough, King writes, some of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.savetheredwoods.org/blog/new-research-illuminates-climate-vulnerability-and-resilience-of-worlds-tallest-trees/">the best research</a> into the effects of climate change on the redwoods in recent years has been funded by none other than Save the Redwoods League—a last-minute grace note for an organization that he has just finished carving apart at the joints.) In the end, after reading more than 400 pages of detailed history, fierce commentary, and taut storytelling, I came away from <i>The Ghost Forest</i> oddly, but—given the book&#39;s spectral title, fittingly—mystified. Are the redwoods safe at last? Or, I wondered, are they merely apparitions, remnants of the past, soon to vanish in the new, harsh light of tomorrow?<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/redwoods-protection-conservation-history/675003/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/redwoods-protection-conservation-history/675003/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel’s Democracy Movement Has Something Important to Teach Us]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Rejecting moralistic hectoring in favor of democratic patriotism, Israel&#39;s protest movement appeals to a people&#39;s sense of what their country can and should be. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/hixQatsLMjFoJDW8GJW5ArpAGOQ=/0x0:8640x4860/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/AP23199604737725/original.jpg" alt="以色列抗议者在逐渐变暗的天空中映出轮廓，挥舞着几面以色列国旗和一面美国国旗。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Oded Balilty / AP</figcaption></figure> The left in the US hasn&#39;t shown much love for the democracy movement that has rocked Israel since January. Such indifference is, perhaps, unsurprising, because many progressives consider Israel to be a—if not the—force for evil in the world. At its recent convention, the Democratic Socialists of America put forward a resolution titled “Make DSA an Anti-Zionist Organization in Principle and Praxis,” and the <em>Harvard Crimson</em> editorial board has “proudly” endorsed a campus protest that equated Zionism with “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/6/25/schneider-israel-wall-of-resistance/">white supremacy</a> ,” among other ills. Even many liberals, including Jewish ones, seem oddly disconnected from the events that are unfolding; in the United States, demonstrations against the Netanyahu government have been insignificant and mainly confined to small left-Zionist groups.<br><br> Some critics <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/19/opinion/israel-democracy-protests.html">insist</a> that Israel isn&#39;t a real democracy because Arab Israelis face discrimination, or because Israel was founded as a state of refuge for the Jewish people, or because the occupation persists. Underlying this view is an oddly moralistic, rather than political, understanding of democracy that confuses it with purity. Democracy—the rule of law, the equality of citizenship, the balance of governmental powers, the freedom to speak and publish, the protection of minorities, the sanctity of elections, the ability to be religious or secular—can be, and in fact usually is, partial and incomplete. Democracies have been known, and not just occasionally, to embark on odious wars, support oppressive institutions, and sustain colonialism; see, for instance, France when it ruled Algeria. The difference is that Israel&#39;s colony—the West Bank—abuts it, rather than being a thousand miles away.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-judicial-reform-and-protests-netanyahu/674849/">Matti Friedman: After 30 years in Israel, I see my country differently</a><br><br> Despite the purists&#39; claims, the unfolding events in Israel are, in fact, an extraordinary example of what democracy in the streets looks like.

All of this activity dwarfs anything we saw in the United States during the Donald Trump years, despite the anti-Trump forces&#39; self-flattering description of themselves as “the Resistance” and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/20/opinion/blm-george-floyd-mural.html">now-dashed hope</a> that Black Lives Matter could create a sustainable, genuinely mass movement. A bit of humility would be apt.<br><br> The mainstream press in the United States, both print and broadcast, has been covering events in Israel. (So have Al Jazeera and Hezbollah&#39;s Al-Manar, which keeps an eye on what it calls “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://english.almanar.com.lb/1884742">the Zionist entity</a> .”) In the US, Israel is sometimes <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/14/the-jerusalem-u-s-israel-strategic-partnership-joint-declaration/">depicted</a> as a country that is just like us—a puny sister democracy with shared values—or, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/americanization-israeli-palestinian-debate-blm/618967/">alternatively</a> , as a country so different from ours that we can&#39;t possibly understand it. Both of these have an element of truth, but each—like the blind men and the elephant—misses the complexity of the situation. And though much of the coverage has focused on the so-called judicial reform, the crisis in Israel extends far beyond that to the very essence of the country&#39;s identity, or multiple identities, and its fissures, which have been decades in the making.<br><br> Israel is not engaged in a conflict merely over legal proposals. As the Israeli journalist Gershom Gorenberg told me, to call the crux of the crisis “judicial overhaul” is like calling the war in Ukraine a special military operation. What&#39;s at stake is whether Israel will remain a modern, liberal democracy—albeit one with grievous defects—or become a dictatorial theocracy, joining the other failed states of the Middle East. That transformation would resonate far outside Israel; the <em>New York Times</em> columnist Thomas Friedman recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/opinion/netanyahu-israel-palestinians-courts.html">wrote</a> that if Ukraine and Israeli democracy go down in defeat, “the whole world would tip the wrong way.”<br><br> Events in Israel do have parallels to those in other countries. As in France and Italy, the once powerful social-democratic left in Israel has shrunk and lost its working-class base. As in Turkey, India, and the United States, radical religious extremists have obtained enormous political power. Ominous parallels between Netanyahu and Trump are especially obvious. Each is a shameless liar who appeals to religious conservatives despite well-known sex scandals <strong>.</strong> Each has declared war on the rule of law, governmental balance of powers, and their county&#39;s elites. Each sees himself as a victim. Each threatens his country&#39;s national security. Each has tried to fracture the cohesion of his multiethnic country through base appeals to racism, ethnic hatred, and presumed grievances. (Unhappily, Slobodan Milošević also comes to mind.) Each has intimidated the once-sane voices within his own party. Each is desperately trying to stay out of jail.<br><br> And though both men pose as ultranationalists, both are prime examples of what the Israeli journalist Alon Pinkas has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-11/ty-article/.highlight/netanyahus-legacy-being-israels-first-post-zionist-prime-minister/00000189-4503-dc58-adcd-fda7ff980000">called</a> the “psycho-political phenomenon” of oikophobia: “a person&#39;s aversion to their home, environment or country.” (Pinkas argues that Netanyahu is essentially an anti-Zionist.) Each has declared war on the country he despises and is happy to see it disintegrate, even in bloodshed, if that is the price of remaining in power.<br><br> But these similarities, though real, can be misleading. Israel is a very different place from the United States (or Western Europe). And the differences, not the similarities, are the key to the Israeli movement&#39;s strength—and to what we can learn from it.<br><br> The United States is a sprawling country. I&#39;ve lived here all my life but have never visited the majority of states. I don&#39;t, I admit, feel too connected to many people in Idaho or Arkansas—except on Election Night, when I resentfully watch their vote tabulations. America is a powerhouse that dwarfs its neighbors, and indeed much of the world. Being apolitical here is easy, if you so choose. I worry a lot about our country&#39;s future, especially these days, but I don&#39;t doubt its continued existence.<br><br> In contrast, Israel is a tiny, claustrophobic country. It is hemmed in by neighbors that, for much of its existence, have tried to destroy it (when you&#39;re there, it&#39;s a bit unnerving to see how close Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are). It has been existentially challenged since the day it declared independence. It is the target of Iran, a large and powerful country whose leadership is enthusiastically dedicated to its destruction. Israelis do not spend their lives quaking in fear. But its security situation dictates that a very large proportion of the population, representing all political tendencies, serves in the armed forces, which is the most binding national institution; about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/world/middleeast/israel-reservists-judicial-overhaul.html">5 percent</a> remain in the reserves for decades. Virtually every Israeli, and every Palestinian in the occupied territories, has lost someone to war, terrorism, or military assault. Most of Israel&#39;s political sea changes, unlike those in the United States, have been the result of its wars and violent conflicts.<br><br> And, in sharp contrast to the world&#39;s other countries, Israel has no set borders. It has neither annexed nor liberated the Palestinian West Bank. It has ruled over another people, who are kept stateless, rights-less, and under violent military dictatorship, for 56 years. So yes, Israel is different.<br><br> An equally significant difference, though, is in the relationship that Israelis have to the state and to one another. In the United States, we focus, sometimes obsessively, on rights. Rights are undeniably crucial. But they aren&#39;t everything. We Americans pay far less attention to the concept of responsibility: of democracy as a dialectic among government, civil society, and citizens. When I ask my students—smart, empathetic, caring young people—what they feel they owe our country, they usually come up blank. But in Israel, as Gorenberg told me, “The social contract is very demanding. There is no tradition of the rugged individual, of American libertarianism; that&#39;s really foreign to us. This is a society that was created with a sense of the collective: The state is supposed to provide a lot, and we&#39;re supposed to provide a lot. The government is violating that”—hence the widespread feeling of anger and betrayal.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/israeli-palestinian-conflict-ferguson/620471/">Susie Linfield: Palestine isn&#39;t Ferguson</a><br><br> In the <em>Times of Israel</em> , the journalist Yossi Klein Halevi <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-wounded-jewish-psyche-and-the-divided-israeli-soul/">wrote</a> :<br><br><p> Over and over, protesters tell interviewers variations on the same story: I&#39;m doing this for my father who was wounded in the Yom Kippur War, for my son who was killed in Lebanon, for my grandparents who were uprooted from Iraq or who survived the Holocaust, for my great-grandparents who helped build the state. Now, they say, it&#39;s my turn to defend the country.</p> That shared social contract has enabled the Israeli movement to be so capacious; it has even incorporated some Likudniks, some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-02-17/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/these-settlers-are-joining-israels-pro-democracy-protest-movement-heres-what-it-means/00000186-5b13-d22b-ad9e-7f732d5d0000">settlers</a> , and some of the religiously observant, who constitute much of Netanyahu&#39;s base. The ideological breadth of the Israeli movement is almost impossible to imagine in the United States, where one needs to sign on to a host of positions—regarding, among other things, immigration; policing; diversity, equity, and inclusion; transgender rights; and yes, hatred of Israel—in order to be welcomed into the progressive camp. Indeed, our parameters of acceptable debate seem to narrow rather than expand. In contrast, the Israeli movement has dispensed with litmus tests; people who disagree—a lot—about crucial issues are marching side by side. One of the main protest organizations in Jerusalem refers to its mission as “protecting the shared home.”<br><br> Like the country itself, the Israeli democracy movement is radically imperfect. A mass movement doesn&#39;t include everyone (although recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-06-15/ty-article/netanyahus-coalition-loses-majority-if-elections-held-today-polls-find/00000188-c02c-d7cb-afcd-d82ea2780000">polls</a> show that the Netanyahu coalition would fall if an election were held today). Divisions between Ashkenazi and Sephardim, between the central cities and the poorer periphery, are deep. Few Arab Israelis are taking part, though they are more imperiled than Jewish Israelis by the governing coalition&#39;s plans. (In February, 200 prominent Arab Israelis <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/first-to-be-harmed-arab-israeli-leaders-sign-petition-against-judicial-overhaul/">released a statement</a> urging Arab citizens to participate in the protests: “A regime change is taking place that will affect the lives of all citizens … and the Arab public will be the first victim,” they wrote.) And despite its wide tent, the movement is, in some sense, dominated by the elite.<br><br> But the elite in Israel is different from ours: Silicon Valley software engineers and leftist academics rarely fight in America&#39;s wars. In contrast, as Halevi pointed out, Israel&#39;s “elites are not only &#39;privileged&#39; but sacrificial.” In any case, as the historian Anita Shapira recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-22/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/will-religious-extremists-bring-israel-down-again/00000189-7528-de6d-a1ef-f5eaeee00000">wrote</a> , “&#39;Elite&#39; is not a dirty word. A country cannot exist without elites. In the weekly mass demonstrations … a large measure of popular strength is also visible.”<br><br> The brutal occupation is Israel&#39;s central, but often unacknowledged, moral and political catastrophe—one that underlies all others and points to two simultaneous, confounding truths. First, Israel can&#39;t rid itself of its racism, ultranationalism, and religious fanaticism until the occupation ends. Ayman Odeh, the head of the predominantly Arab Hadash-Ta&#39;al Party, put the point succinctly when he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2023-06-04/ty-article-opinion/how-long-can-the-judicial-overhaul-protests-ignore-israeli-occupation-for/00000188-8344-d952-af9f-b75f31720000">addressed</a> “the dear demonstrators on Kaplan Street” in <em>Haaretz</em> : “The occupation is the umbilical cord of Israeli fascism.” Second, the occupation won&#39;t (and some, even on the left, say can&#39;t) end tomorrow. The upshot is that, paradoxically, the defense of democracy can&#39;t wait for its precondition to emerge. Some Israelis, hopefully a growing number, recognize this conundrum. But they also know that a partial, even drastically defective democracy is categorically different from a dictatorship.<br><br> Most important, Israel&#39;s protest movement has rejected moralistic hectoring in favor of democratic patriotism. It appeals to a people&#39;s sense of what their country can and should be, rather than fostering guilt and shame.<br><br> Democratic patriotism isn&#39;t alien to the United States. On the contrary, it&#39;s been the basis of our best—and, arguably, most successful—movements. Think of the abolitionists, who rejected slavery—a worldwide institution that had existed for several millennia—as a betrayal of our country&#39;s essential principles; of the militant, interracial union movement from the 1930s to 1950s, which insisted that fair worker compensation and labor rights were the American way; of the early civil-rights movement, which, though originally emanating from the Black churches of the South, appealed to fellow Americans not on the basis of Christian values but on those of shared citizenship.<br><br> The departure from this ethos came in the &#39;60s, when the more radical segment of the anti–Vietnam War movement, in understandable anger and frustration, represented itself not only as an opponent of a deeply immoral war but of “AmeriKKKa” itself. (Carrying Vietcong flags did not go over well with the working-class people whose sons were dying in the Mekong Delta.) More recently, the anti-racist movement that has emerged from Black Lives Matters often paints the United States as founded on, and eternally stamped by, a desolate fusion of “original sin,” racist “DNA,” and genocide.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/american-liberals-israel-protests-patriotism/673540/">Gal Beckerman: What American liberals can learn from Israel&#39;s protests</a><br><br> The Israelis, in contrast, have unashamedly put themselves forth as patriots: They are organizing <em>for</em> the country, which means for their neighbors, not against it or them. They have seized the flag back from the racist hooligans who terrorize local Palestinians in Jerusalem in the annual flag parade. They have refused to be intimidated by the right&#39;s traditional accusations of treason. They have proudly declared that democracy <em>is</em> patriotism, and vice versa.<br><br> In short, the Israeli movement is a model for what it means to despise your government but to love your country. It shows that creating a welcoming sense of civic identity—open to all who prize democracy rather than to an enlightened few—is the sine qua non of a mass movement. This is the Israelis&#39; gift to us, and their lesson—one that I hope we can learn, not for their sake but for ours.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/israel-democracy-protests-2023-netanyahu-occupation/674977/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/israel-democracy-protests-2023-netanyahu-occupation/674977/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How America Got Mean]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> In a culture devoid of moral education, generations are growing up in a morally inarticulate, self-referential world. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ErwHrDisYTvej8Qd9FpdaGlQsAI=/0x157:3000x1845/1440x810/media/img/2023/07/24/0923_WEL_Brooks_MoralCollapseOpener/original.jpg" alt="镜子碎片排列成美国的形状，倒映着一棵树和天空" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> O <span class="smallcaps">ver the past</span> eight years or so, I&#39;ve been obsessed with two questions. The first is: Why have Americans become so sad? The rising rates of depression have been well publicized, as have the rising deaths of despair from drugs, alcohol, and suicide. But other statistics are similarly troubling. The percentage of people who say they don&#39;t have close friends has increased fourfold since 1990. The share of Americans ages 25 to 54 who weren&#39;t married or living with a romantic partner went up to 38 percent in 2019, from 29 percent in 1990. A record-high 25 percent of 40-year-old Americans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/28/a-record-high-share-of-40-year-olds-in-the-us-have-never-been-married/">have never married</a> . More than half of all Americans say that no one knows them well. The percentage of high-school students who report “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness” shot up from 26 percent in 2009 to 44 percent in 2021.<br><br> My second, related question is: Why have Americans become so mean? I was recently talking with a restaurant owner who said that he has to eject a customer from his restaurant for rude or cruel behavior once a week—something that never used to happen. A head nurse at a hospital told me that many on her staff are leaving the profession because patients have become so abusive. At the far extreme of meanness, hate crimes rose in 2020 to their highest level in 12 years. Murder rates have been surging, at least until recently. Same with gun sales. Social trust is plummeting. In 2000, two-thirds of American households gave to charity; in 2018, fewer than half did. The words that define our age reek of menace: <i>conspiracy</i> , <i>polarization</i> , <i>mass shootings</i> , <i>trauma</i> , <i>safe spaces</i> .<br><br> We&#39;re enmeshed in some sort of emotional, relational, and spiritual crisis, and it undergirds our political dysfunction and the general crisis of our democracy.到底是怎么回事？<br><br> Over the past few years, different social observers have offered different stories to explain the rise of hatred, anxiety, and despair.<br><br> <i>The technology story:</i> Social media is driving us all crazy.<br><br> <i>The sociology story:</i> We&#39;ve stopped participating in community organizations and are more isolated.<br><br> <i>The demography story:</i> America, long a white-dominated nation, is becoming a much more diverse country, a change that has millions of white Americans in a panic.<br><br> <i>The economy story:</i> High levels of economic inequality and insecurity have left people afraid, alienated, and pessimistic.<br><br> I agree, to an extent, with all of these stories, but I don&#39;t think any of them is the deepest one. Sure, social media has bad effects, but it is everywhere around the globe—and the mental-health crisis is not. Also, the rise of despair and hatred has engulfed a lot of people who are not on social media. Economic inequality is real, but it doesn&#39;t fully explain this level of social and emotional breakdown. The sociologists are right that we&#39;re more isolated, but why? What values lead us to choose lifestyles that make us lonely and miserable?<br><br> The most important story about why Americans have become sad and alienated and rude, I believe, is also the simplest: We inhabit a society in which people are no longer trained in how to treat others with kindness and consideration. Our society has become one in which people feel licensed to give their selfishness free rein. The story I&#39;m going to tell is about morals. In a healthy society, a web of institutions—families, schools, religious groups, community organizations, and workplaces—helps form people into kind and responsible citizens, the sort of people who show up for one another. We live in a society that&#39;s terrible at moral formation.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/pandemic-american-shoppers-nightmare/619650/">Read: American shoppers are a nightmare</a><br><br> Moral formation, as I will use that stuffy-sounding term here, comprises three things. First, helping people learn to restrain their selfishness. How do we keep our evolutionarily conferred egotism under control? Second, teaching basic social and ethical skills. How do you welcome a neighbor into your community? How do you disagree with someone constructively? And third, helping people find a purpose in life. Morally formative institutions hold up a set of ideals. They provide practical pathways toward a meaningful existence: <i>Here&#39;s how you can dedicate your life to serving the poor, or protecting the nation, or loving your neighbor.</i><br><br> For a large part of its history, America was awash in morally formative institutions. Its Founding Fathers had a low view of human nature, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-51-60">designed the Constitution to mitigate it</a> (even while validating that low view of human nature by producing a document rife with racism and sexism). “Men I find to be a Sort of Beings very badly constructed,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-37-02-0277">Benjamin Franklin wrote</a> , “as they are generally more easily provok&#39;d than reconcil&#39;d, more dispos&#39;d to do Mischief to each other than to make Reparation, and much more easily deceiv&#39;d than undeceiv&#39;d.”<br><br> If such flawed, self-centered creatures were going to govern themselves and be decent neighbors to one another, they were going to need some training. For roughly 150 years after the founding, Americans were obsessed with moral education. In 1788, Noah Webster wrote, “The <i>virtues</i> of men are of more consequence to society than their <i>abilities</i> ; and for this reason, the <i>heart</i> should be cultivated with more assiduity than the <i>head</i> .” The progressive philosopher John Dewey wrote in 1909 that schools teach morality “every moment of the day, five days a week.” Hollis Frissell, the president of the Hampton Institute, an early school for African Americans, declared, “Character is the main object of education.” As late as 1951, a commission organized by the National Education Association, one of the main teachers&#39; unions, stated that “an unremitting concern for moral and spiritual values continues to be a top priority for education.”<br><br> The moral-education programs that stippled the cultural landscape during this long stretch of history came from all points on the political and religious spectrums. School textbooks such as <i>McGuffey&#39;s Eclectic Readers</i> not only taught students how to read and write; they taught etiquette, and featured stories designed to illustrate right and wrong behavior. In the 1920s, WEB Du Bois&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2022/08/w-e-b-dubois-and-the-brownies-book/">magazine for Black children</a> , <i>The Brownies&#39; Book</i> , had a regular column called “The Judge,” which provided guidance to young readers on morals and manners. There were thriving school organizations with morally earnest names that sound quaint today—the Courtesy Club, the Thrift Club, the Knighthood of Youth.<br><br> Beyond the classroom lay a host of other groups: the YMCA; the Sunday-school movement; the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts; the settlement-house movement, which brought rich and poor together to serve the marginalized; Aldo Leopold&#39;s land ethic, which extended our moral concerns to include proper care for the natural world; professional organizations, which enforced ethical codes; unions and workplace associations, which, in addition to enhancing worker protections and paychecks, held up certain standards of working-class respectability. And of course, by the late 19th century, many Americans were members of churches or other religious communities. Mere religious faith doesn&#39;t always make people morally good, but living in a community, orienting your heart toward some transcendent love, basing your value system on concern for the underserved—those things tend to.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/kindness-happiness-negative-feedback/673862/">Arthur C. Brooks: Make yourself happy—be kind</a><br><br> An educational approach with German roots that was adopted by Scandinavian societies in the mid-to-late 19th century had a wide influence on America. It was called <i>Bildung</i> , roughly meaning “spiritual formation.” As conceived by Wilhelm von Humboldt, the <i>Bildung</i> approach gave professors complete freedom to put moral development at the center of a university&#39;s mission. In schools across Scandinavia, students studied literature and folk cultures to identify their own emotions, wounds, and weaknesses, in order to become the complex human beings that modern society required. Schools in the <i>Bildung</i> tradition also aimed to clarify the individual&#39;s responsibilities to the wider world—family, friends, nation, humanity. Start with the soul and move outward.<br><br> The <i>Bildung</i> movement helped inspire the Great Books programs that popped up at places like Columbia and the University of Chicago. They were based on the conviction that reading the major works of world literature and thinking about them deeply would provide the keys to living a richer life. Meanwhile, discipline in the small proprieties of daily existence—dressing formally, even just to go shopping or to a ball game—was considered evidence of uprightness: proof that you were a person who could be counted on when the large challenges came.<br><br> Much of American moral education drew on an ethos expressed by the headmaster of the Stowe School, in England, who wrote in 1930 that the purpose of his institution was to turn out young men who were “acceptable at a dance and invaluable in a shipwreck.” America&#39;s National Institute for Moral Instruction was founded in 1911 and published a “Children&#39;s Morality Code,” with 10 rules for right living. At the turn of the 20th century, Mount Holyoke College, an all-women&#39;s institution, was an example of an intentionally thick moral community. When a young Frances Perkins was a student there, her Latin teacher detected a certain laziness in her. She forced Perkins to spend hours conjugating Latin verbs, to cultivate self-discipline. Perkins grew to appreciate this: “For the first time I became conscious of character.” The school also called upon women to follow morally ambitious paths. “Do what nobody else wants to do; go where nobody else wants to go,” the school&#39;s founder implored. Holyoke launched women into lives of service in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. Perkins, who would become the first woman to serve in a presidential Cabinet (Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s), was galvanized there.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/students-broken-moral-compasses/492866/">Read: Students&#39; broken moral compasses</a><br><br> These various approaches to moral formation shared two premises. The first was that training the heart and body is more important than training the reasoning brain. Some moral skills can be taught the way academic subjects are imparted, through books and lectures. But we learn most virtues the way we learn crafts, through the repetition of many small habits and practices, all within a coherent moral culture—a community of common values, whose members aspire to earn one another&#39;s respect.<br><br> The other guiding premise was that concepts like justice and right and wrong are not matters of personal taste: An objective moral order exists, and human beings are creatures who habitually sin against that order. This recognition was central, for example, to the way the civil-rights movement in the 1950s and early 1960s thought about character formation. “Instead of assured progress in wisdom and decency man faces the ever present possibility of swift relapse not merely to animalism but into such calculated cruelty as no other animal can practice,” Martin Luther King Jr. believed. Elsewhere, he wrote, “The force of sinfulness is so stubborn a characteristic of human nature that it can only be restrained when the social unit is armed with both moral and physical might.”<br><br> At their best, the civil-rights marchers in this prophetic tradition understood that they could become corrupted even while serving a noble cause. They could become self-righteous because their cause was just, hardened by hatred of their opponents, prideful as they asserted power. King&#39;s strategy of nonviolence was an effort simultaneously to expose the sins of their oppressors and to restrain the sinful tendencies inherent in themselves. “What gave such widely compelling force to King&#39;s leadership and oratory,” the historian George Marsden argues, “was his bedrock conviction that moral law was built into the universe.”<br><br> A couple of obvious things need to be said about this ethos of moral formation that dominated American life for so long. It prevailed alongside all sorts of hierarchies that we now rightly find abhorrent: whites superior to Blacks, men to women, Christians to Jews, straight people to gay people. And the emphasis on morality didn&#39;t produce perfect people. Moral formation doesn&#39;t succeed in making people angels—it tries to make them better than they otherwise might be.<br><br> Furthermore, we would never want to go back to the training methods that prevailed for so long, rooted in so many <i>thou shall not</i> s and so much shaming, and riddled with so much racism and sexism. Yet a wise accounting should acknowledge that emphasizing moral formation meant focusing on an important question—what is life for?—and teaching people how to bear up under inevitable difficulties. A culture invested in shaping character helped make people resilient by giving them ideals to cling to when times got hard. In some ways, the old approach to moral formation was, at least theoretically, egalitarian: If your status in the community was based on character and reputation, then a farmer could earn dignity as readily as a banker. This ethos came down hard on self-centeredness and narcissistic display. It offered practical guidance on how to be a good neighbor, a good friend.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">And then</span> it mostly went away.<br><br> The crucial pivot happened just after World War II, as people wrestled with the horrors of the 20th century. One group, personified by the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, argued that recent events had exposed the prevalence of human depravity and the dangers, in particular, of tribalism, nationalism, and collective pride. This group wanted to double down on moral formation, with a greater emphasis on humility.<br><br> Another group, personified by Carl Rogers, a founder of humanistic psychology, focused on the problem of authority. The trouble with the 20th century, the members of this group argued, was that the existence of rigid power hierarchies led to oppression in many spheres of life. We need to liberate individuals from these authority structures, many contended. People are naturally good and can be trusted to do their own self-actualization.<br><br> After decades without much in the way of moral formation, America became a place where 74 million people looked at Donald Trump&#39;s morality and saw presidential timber.<br><br> A cluster of phenomenally successful books appeared in the decade after World War II, making the case that, as Rabbi Joshua Loth Liebman wrote in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/peace-of-mind-insights-on-human-nature-that-can-change-your-life-joshua-l-liebman/9780806514963?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Peace of Mind</i></a> (1946), “thou shalt not be afraid of thy hidden impulses.” People can trust the goodness inside. His book topped the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list for 58 weeks. Dr. Spock&#39;s first child-rearing manual was published the same year. That was followed by books like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking-10-traits-for-maximum-results-norman-vincent-peale/9780743234801?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i></a> (1952). According to this ethos, morality is not something that we develop in communities. It&#39;s nurtured by connecting with our authentic self and finding our true inner voice. If people are naturally good, we don&#39;t need moral formation; we just need to let people get in touch with themselves. Organization after organization got out of the moral-formation business and into the self-awareness business. By the mid‑1970s, for example, the Girl Scouts&#39; founding ethos of service to others had shifted: “How can you get more in touch with <i>you</i> ? What are <i>you</i> thinking? What are <i>you</i> feeling?” one Girl Scout handbook asked.<br><br> Schools began to abandon moral formation in the 1940s and &#39;50s, as the education historian B. Edward McClellan chronicles in <i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/moral-education-in-america-schools-and-the-shaping-of-character-from-colonial-times-to-the-present-b-edward-mcclellan/9780807738207?affiliate_id=atl-347">Moral Education in America</a></i> : “By the 1960s deliberate moral education was in full-scale retreat” as educators “paid more attention to the SAT scores of their students, and middle-class parents scrambled to find schools that would give their children the best chances to qualify for elite colleges and universities.” The postwar period saw similar change at the college level, Anthony Kronman, a former dean of Yale Law School, has noted. The “research ideal” supplanted the earlier humanistic ideal of cultivating the whole student. As academics grew more specialized, Kronman has argued, the big questions—What is the meaning of life? How do you live a good life?—lost all purchase. Such questions became unprofessional for an academic to even ask.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/the-benefits-of-character-education/275585/">Read: The benefits of character education</a><br><br> In sphere after sphere, people decided that moral reasoning was not really relevant. Psychology&#39;s purview grew, especially in family and educational matters, its vocabulary framing “virtually all public discussion” of the moral life of children, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/storage/app/uploads/public/58e/1a4/f58/58e1a4f58adfb826575976.pdf">James Davison Hunter, a prominent American scholar on character education, noted in 2000</a> . “For decades now, contributions from philosophers and theologians have been muted or nonexistent.” Psychology is a wonderful profession, but its goal is mental health, not moral growth.<br><br> From the start, some worried about this privatizing of morality. “If what is good, what is right, what is true is only what the individual &#39;chooses&#39; to &#39;invent,&#39; ” Walter Lippmann wrote in his 1955 collection, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-public-philosophy-walter-lippmann/9780887387913?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Essays in the Public Philosophy</i></a> , “then we are outside the traditions of civility.” His book was hooted down by establishment figures such as the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.; the de-moralization of American culture was under way.<br><br> Over the course of the 20th century, words relating to morality appeared less and less frequently in the nation&#39;s books: According to a 2012 paper, usage of a cluster of words related to being virtuous also declined significantly. Among them were <i>bravery</i> (which dropped by 65 percent), <i>gratitude</i> (58 percent), and <i>humbleness</i> (55 percent). For decades, researchers have asked incoming college students about their goals in life. In 1967, about 85 percent said they were strongly motivated to develop “a meaningful philosophy of life”; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.heri.ucla.edu/PDFs/pubs/TFS/Norms/Monographs/TheAmericanFreshman2000.pdf">by 2000, only 42 percent said that</a> . Being financially well off became the leading life goal; by 2015, 82 percent of students said wealth was their aim.<br><br> In a culture devoid of moral education, generations grow up in a morally inarticulate, self-referential world. The Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith and a team of researchers asked young adults across the country in 2008 about their moral lives. One of their findings was that the interviewees had not given the subject of morality much thought. “I&#39;ve never had to make a decision about what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong,” one young adult told the researchers. “My teachers avoid controversies like that like the plague,” many teenagers said.<br><br> The moral instincts that Smith observed in his sample fell into the pattern that the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre called “emotivism”: <i>Whatever feels good to me is moral.</i> “I would probably do what would make me happy” in any given situation <b>,</b> one of the interviewees declared. “Because it&#39;s me in the long run.” As another put it, “If you&#39;re okay with it morally, as long as you&#39;re not getting caught, then it&#39;s not really against your morals, is it?” Smith and his colleagues emphasized that the interviewees were not bad people but, because they were living “in morally very thin or spotty worlds,” they had never been given a moral vocabulary or learned moral skills.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Most of us</span> who noticed the process of de-moralization as it was occurring thought a bland moral relativism and empty consumerism would be the result: <i>You do you and I&#39;ll do me.</i> That&#39;s not what happened.<br><br> “Moral communities are fragile things, hard to build and easy to destroy,” the psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-righteous-mind-why-good-people-are-divided-by-politics-and-religion-jonathan-haidt/9780307455772?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Righteous Mind</i></a> . When you are raised in a culture without ethical structure, you become internally fragile. You have no moral compass to give you direction, no permanent ideals to which you can swear ultimate allegiance. “He who has a <i>why</i> to live for can bear with almost any <i>how</i> ,” the psychiatrist (and Holocaust survivor) Viktor Frankl wrote, interpreting a famous Nietzsche saying. Those without a <i>why</i> fall apart when the storms hit. They begin to suffer from that feeling of moral emptiness that Émile Durkheim called “anomie.”<br><br> Expecting people to build a satisfying moral and spiritual life on their own by looking within themselves is asking too much. A culture that leaves people morally naked and alone leaves them without the skills to be decent to one another. Social trust falls partly because more people are untrustworthy. That creates crowds of what psychologists call “vulnerable narcissists.” We all know grandiose narcissists—people who revere themselves as the center of the universe. Vulnerable narcissists are the more common figures in our day—people who are also addicted to thinking about themselves, but who often feel anxious, insecure, avoidant. Intensely sensitive to rejection, they scan for hints of disrespect. Their self-esteem is wildly in flux. Their uncertainty about their inner worth triggers cycles of distrust, shame, and hostility.<br><br> “The breakdown of an enduring moral framework will always produce disconnection, alienation, and an estrangement from those around you,” Luke Bretherton, a theologian at Duke Divinity School, told me. The result is the kind of sadness I see in the people around me. Young adults I know are spiraling, leaving school, moving from one mental-health facility to another. After a talk I gave in Oklahoma, a woman asked me, “What do you do when you no longer want to be alive?” The very next night I had dinner with a woman who told me that her brother had died by suicide three months before. I mentioned these events to a group of friends on a Zoom call, and nearly half of them said they&#39;d had a brush with suicide in their family. Statistics paint the broader picture: Suicide rates have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/index.html">increased by more than 30 percent</a> since 2000, according to the CDC.<br><br> Sadness, loneliness, and self-harm turn into bitterness. Social pain is ultimately a response to a sense of rejection—of being invisible, unheard, disrespected, victimized. When people feel that their identity is unrecognized, the experience registers as an injustice—because it is. People who have been treated unjustly often lash out and seek ways to humiliate those who they believe have humiliated them.<br><br> Even as our public life has grown morally bare, people yearn to feel respected and worthy of respect, need to feel that their life has some moral purpose and meaning.<br><br> Lonely eras are not just sad eras; they are violent ones. In 19th-century America, when a lot of lonely young men were crossing the western frontier, one of the things they tended to do was shoot one another. As the saying goes, pain that is not transformed gets transmitted. People grow more callous, defensive, distrustful, and hostile. The pandemic made it worse, but antisocial behavior is still high even though the lockdowns are over. And now we are caught in a cycle, ill treatment leading to humiliation and humiliation leading to more meanness. Social life becomes more barbaric, online and off.<br><br> If you put people in a moral vacuum, they will seek to fill it with the closest thing at hand. Over the past several years, people have sought to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/collapsing-levels-trust-are-devastating-america/616581/">fill the moral vacuum</a> with politics and tribalism. American society has become hyper-politicized.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/collapsing-levels-trust-are-devastating-america/616581/">David Brooks: America is having a moral convulsion</a><br><br> According to research by Ryan Streeter, the director of domestic-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, lonely young people are seven times more likely to say they are active in politics than young people who aren&#39;t lonely. For people who feel disrespected, unseen, and alone, politics is a seductive form of social therapy. It offers them a comprehensible moral landscape: The line between good and evil runs not down the middle of every human heart, but between groups. Life is a struggle between us, the forces of good, and them, the forces of evil.<br><br> The Manichaean tribalism of politics appears to give people a sense of belonging. For many years, America seemed to be awash in a culture of hyper-individualism. But these days, people are quick to identify themselves by their group: Republican, Democrat, evangelical, person of color, LGBTQ, southerner, patriot, progressive, conservative. People who feel isolated and under threat flee to totalizing identities.<br><br> Politics appears to give people a sense of righteousness: A person&#39;s moral stature is based not on their conduct, but on their location on the political spectrum. You don&#39;t have to be good; you just have to be liberal—or you just have to be conservative. The stronger a group&#39;s claim to victim status, the more virtuous it is assumed to be, and the more secure its members can feel about their own innocence.<br><br> Politics also provides an easy way to feel a sense of purpose. You don&#39;t have to feed the hungry or sit with the widow to be moral; you just have to experience the right emotion. You delude yourself that you are participating in civic life by feeling properly enraged at the other side. That righteous fury rising in your gut lets you know that you are engaged in caring about this country. The culture war is a struggle that gives life meaning.<br><br> Politics overwhelms everything. Churches, universities, sports, pop culture, health care are swept up in a succession of battles that are really just one big war—red versus blue. Evangelicalism used to be a faith; today it&#39;s primarily a political identity. College humanities departments used to study literature and history to plumb the human heart and mind; now they sometimes seem exclusively preoccupied with politics, and with the oppressive systems built around race, class, and gender. Late-night comedy shows have become political pep rallies. Hundreds of thousands of Americans died unnecessarily during the pandemic because people saw a virus through the lens of a political struggle.<br><br> This is not politics as it is normally understood. In psychically healthy societies, people fight over the politics of distribution: How high should taxes be? How much money should go to social programs for the poor and the elderly? We&#39;ve shifted focus from the politics of redistribution to the politics of recognition. Political movements are fueled by resentment, by feelings that society does not respect or recognize me. Political and media personalities gin up dramas in which our side is emotionally validated and the other side is emotionally shamed. The person practicing the politics of recognition is not trying to get resources for himself or his constituency; he is trying to admire himself. He&#39;s trying to use politics to fill the hole in his soul. It doesn&#39;t work.<br><br> The politics of recognition doesn&#39;t give you community and connection, certainly not in a system like our current one, mired in structural dysfunction. People join partisan tribes in search of belonging—but they end up in a lonely mob of isolated belligerents who merely obey the same orthodoxy.<br><br> If you are asking politics to be the reigning source of meaning in your life, you are asking more of politics than it can bear. Seeking to escape sadness, loneliness, and anomie through politics serves only to drop you into a world marked by fear and rage, by a sadistic striving for domination. Sure, you&#39;ve left the moral vacuum—but you&#39;ve landed in the pulverizing destructiveness of moral war. The politics of recognition has not produced a happy society. When asked by the General Social Survey to rate their happiness level, 20 percent of Americans in 2022 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/trends?category=Gender%20%26%20Marriage&amp;measure=happy">rated it at the lowest level</a> —only 8 percent did the same in 1990.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/">Read: What the longest study on human happiness found is the key to a good life</a><br><br> America&#39;s Founding Fathers studied the history of democracies going back to ancient Greece. They drew the lesson that democracies can be quite fragile. When private virtue fails, the constitutional order crumbles. After decades without much in the way of moral formation, America became a place where more than 74 million people looked at Donald Trump&#39;s morality and saw presidential timber.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Even in dark times,</span> sparks of renewal appear. In 2018, a documentary about Mister Rogers called <i>Won&#39;t You Be My Neighbor?</i> was released. The film showed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/what-would-mister-rogers-do/600772/">Fred Rogers in all his simple goodness</a> —his small acts of generosity; his displays of vulnerability; his respect, even reverence, for each child he encountered. People cried openly while watching it in theaters. In an age of conflict and threat, the sight of radical goodness was so moving.<br><br> In the summer of 2020, the series <i>Ted Lasso</i> premiered. When Lasso describes his goals as a soccer coach, he could mention the championships he hopes to win or some other conventional metric of success, but he says, “For me, success is not about the wins and losses. It&#39;s about helping these young fellas be the best versions of themselves on and off the field.”<br><br> That is a two-sentence description of moral formation. <i>Ted Lasso</i> is about an earnest, cheerful, and transparently kind man who enters a world that has grown cynical, amoral, and manipulative, and, episode after episode, even through his own troubles, he offers the people around him opportunities to grow more gracious, to confront their vulnerabilities and fears, and to treat one another more gently and wisely. Amid lockdowns and political rancor, it became a cultural touchstone, and the most watched show on Apple TV+.<br><br> Even as our public life has grown morally bare, people, as part of their elemental nature, yearn to feel respected and worthy of respect, need to feel that their life has some moral purpose and meaning. People still want to build a society in which it is easier to be good. So the questions before us are pretty simple: How can we build morally formative institutions that are right for the 21st century? What do we need to do to build a culture that helps people become the best versions of themselves?<br><br> Healthy moral ecologies don&#39;t just happen. They have to be seeded and tended.<br><br> A few necessities come immediately to mind.<br><br> <i>A modern vision of how to build character.</i> The old-fashioned models of character-building were hopelessly gendered. Men were supposed to display iron willpower that would help them achieve self-mastery over their unruly passions. Women were to sequester themselves in a world of ladylike gentility in order to not be corrupted by bad influences and base desires. Those formulas are obsolete today.<br><br> The best modern approach to building character is described in Iris Murdoch&#39;s book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-sovereignty-of-good-iris-murdoch/9780415854733?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Sovereignty of Good</i></a> . Murdoch writes that “nothing in life is of any value except the attempt to be virtuous.” For her, moral life is not defined merely by great deeds of courage or sacrifice in epic moments. Instead, moral life is something that goes on continually—treating people considerately in the complex situations of daily existence. For her, the essential moral act is casting a “just and loving” attention on other people.<br><br> Normally, she argues, we go about our days with self-centered, self-serving eyes. We see and judge people in ways that satisfy our own ego. We diminish and stereotype and ignore, reducing other people to bit players in our own all-consuming personal drama. But we become morally better, she continues, as we learn to see others deeply, as we learn to envelop others in the kind of patient, caring regard that makes them feel seen, heard, and understood. This is the kind of attention that implicitly asks, “What are you going through?” and cares about the answer.<br><br> I become a better person as I become more curious about those around me, as I become more skilled in seeing from their point of view. As I learn to perceive you with a patient and loving regard, I will tend to treat you well. We can, Murdoch concluded, “grow by looking.”<br><br> <i>Mandatory social-skills courses.</i> Murdoch&#39;s character-building formula roots us in the simple act of paying attention: <i>Do I attend to you well?</i> It also emphasizes that character is formed and displayed as we treat others considerately. This requires not just a good heart, but good social skills: how to listen well. How to disagree with respect. How to ask for and offer forgiveness. How to patiently cultivate a friendship. How to sit with someone who is grieving or depressed. How to be a good conversationalist.<br><br> These are some of the most important skills a person can have. And yet somehow, we don&#39;t teach them. Our schools spend years prepping students with professional skills—but offer little guidance on how to be an upstanding person in everyday life. If we&#39;re going to build a decent society, elementary schools and high schools should require students to take courses that teach these specific social skills, and thus prepare them for life with one another. We could have courses in how to be a good listener or how to build a friendship. The late feminist philosopher Nel Noddings <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://stanfordmag.org/contents/she-brought-caring-to-education-research">developed a whole pedagogy</a> around how to effectively care for others.<br><br> <i>A new core curriculum.</i> More and more colleges and universities are offering courses in what you might call “How to Live.” Yale has one called “Life Worth Living.” Notre Dame has one called “God and the Good Life.” A first-year honors program in this vein at Valparaiso University, in Indiana, involves not just conducting formal debates on ideas gleaned from the Great Books, but putting on a musical production based on their themes. Many of these courses don&#39;t give students a ready-made formula, but they introduce students to some of the venerated moral traditions—Buddhism, Judeo-Christianity, and Enlightenment rationalism, among others. They introduce students to those thinkers who have thought hard on moral problems, from Aristotle to Desmond Tutu to Martha Nussbaum. They hold up diverse exemplars to serve as models of how to live well. They put the big questions of life firmly on the table: <i>What is the ruling passion of your soul? Whom are you responsible to? What are my moral obligations? What will it take for my life to be meaningful? What does it mean to be a good human in today&#39;s world? What are the central issues we need to engage with concerning new technology and human life?</i><br><br> These questions clash with the ethos of the modern university, which is built around specialization and passing on professional or technical knowledge. But they are the most important courses a college can offer. They shouldn&#39;t be on the margins of academic life. They should be part of the required core curriculum.<br><br> <i>Intergenerational service.</i> We spend most of our lives living by the logic of the meritocracy: Life is an individual climb upward toward success. It&#39;s about pursuing self-interest.<br><br> There should be at least two periods of life when people have a chance to take a sabbatical from the meritocracy and live by an alternative logic—the logic of service: You have to give to receive. You have to lose yourself in a common cause to find yourself. The deepest human relationships are gift relationships, based on mutual care. (An obvious model for at least some aspects of this is the culture of the US military, which similarly emphasizes honor, service, selflessness, and character in support of a purpose greater than oneself, throwing together Americans of different ages and backgrounds who forge strong social bonds.)<br><br> Those sabbaticals could happen at the end of the school years and at the end of the working years. National service programs could bring younger and older people together to work to address community needs.<br><br> These programs would allow people to experience other-centered ways of being and develop practical moral habits: how to cooperate with people unlike you. How to show up day after day when progress is slow. How to do work that is generous and hard.<br><br> <i>Moral organizations.</i> Most organizations serve two sets of goals—moral goals and instrumental goals. Hospitals heal the sick and also seek to make money. Newspapers and magazines inform the public and also try to generate clicks. Law firms defend clients and also try to maximize billable hours. Nonprofits aim to serve the public good and also raise money.<br><br> In our society, the commercial or utilitarian goals tend to eclipse the moral goals. Doctors are pressured by hospital administrators to rush through patients so they can charge more fees. Journalists are incentivized to write stories that confirm reader prejudices in order to climb the most-read lists. Whole companies slip into an optimization mindset, in which everything is done to increase output and efficiency.<br><br> Moral renewal won&#39;t come until we have leaders who are explicit, loud, and credible about both sets of goals. <i>Here&#39;s how we&#39;re growing financially</i> , but also <i>Here&#39;s how we&#39;re learning to treat one another with consideration and respect; here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to forgo some financial returns in order to better serve our higher mission</i> .<br><br> Early in my career, as a TV pundit at <i>PBS NewsHour</i> , I worked with its host, Jim Lehrer. Every day, with a series of small gestures, he signaled what kind of behavior was valued there and what kind of behavior was unacceptable. In this subtle way, he established a set of norms and practices that still lives on. He and others built a thick and coherent moral ecology, and its way of being was internalized by most of the people who have worked there.<br><br> <i>Politics as a moral enterprise.</i> An ancient brand of amoralism now haunts the world. Authoritarian-style leaders like Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Xi Jinping embody a kind of amoral realism. They evince a mindset that assumes that the world is a vicious, dog-eat-dog sort of place. Life is a competition to grab what you can. Force is what matters. Morality is a luxury we cannot afford, or merely a sham that elites use to mask their own lust for power. It&#39;s fine to elect people who lie, who are corrupt, as long as they are ruthless bastards for our side.目的证明手段是正当的。<br><br> Those of us who oppose these authoritarians stand, by contrast, for a philosophy of moral realism. Yes, of course people are selfish and life can be harsh. But over the centuries, civilizations have established rules and codes to nurture cooperation, to build trust and sweeten our condition. These include personal moral codes so we know how to treat one another well, ethical codes to help prevent corruption on the job and in public life, and the rules of the liberal world order so that nations can live in peace, secure within their borders.<br><br> Moral realists are fighting to defend and modernize these rules and standards—these sinews of civilization. Moral realism is built on certain core principles. Character is destiny. We can either elect people who try to embody the highest standards of honesty, kindness, and integrity, or elect people who shred those standards. Statecraft is soulcraft. The laws we pass shape the kinds of people we become. We can structure our tax code to encourage people to be enterprising and to save more, or we can structure the code to encourage people to be conniving and profligate. Democracy is the system that best enhances human dignity. Democratic regimes entrust power to the people, and try to form people so they will be responsible with that trust. Authoritarian regimes seek to create a world in which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.<br><br> Look, I understand why people don&#39;t want to get all moralistic in public. Many of those who do are self-righteous prigs, or rank hypocrites. And all of this is only a start. But healthy moral ecologies don&#39;t just happen. They have to be seeded and tended by people who think and talk in moral terms, who try to model and inculcate moral behavior, who understand that we have to build moral communities because on our own, we are all selfish and flawed. Moral formation is best when it&#39;s humble. It means giving people the skills and habits that will help them be considerate to others in the complex situations of life. It means helping people behave in ways that make other people feel included, seen, and respected. That&#39;s very different from how we treat people now—in ways that make them feel sad and lonely, and that make them grow unkind.<br><br> <small><i>This article appears in the</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09"><i>September 2023</i></a> <i>print edition with the headline “How America Got Mean.” When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-special-election-issue-1-abortion/674957/">上周以压倒性多数投票反对共和党和反堕胎势力推动的投票倡议，该倡议</a>旨在将州宪法未来修正案的通过门槛提高到 60%。该提案被称为“问题 1”，旨在减少选民在 11 月投票中批准一项单独动议的机会，该动议旨在推翻俄亥俄州共和党人 2019 年批准的为期六周的堕胎禁令。<br><br>俄亥俄州最大的几个县对第一期的压倒性反对延续了一种响亮的模式。自最高法院 2022 年<i>多布斯</i>判决推翻了全国宪法规定的堕胎权以来，七个州举行了投票动议，允许选民就该程序是否应保持合法进行权衡：加利福尼亚州、佛蒙特州、蒙大拿州、密歇根州、堪萨斯州、肯塔基州和现在俄亥俄州。此外，威斯康星州选民<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-2024-races/673567/">在一场围绕堕胎是否应在该州合法化的问题主导的竞选中选出了一位新的州最高法院法官。</a><br><br> <a

20 世纪：制造业、能源开采和农业。反过来，民主党正在全国几乎所有最大的都市区巩固自己的优势，这些都市区往往种族更加多元化，更加世俗化，并且更加融入不断扩张的 21 世纪信息时代经济。<br><br>无党派智<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/programs/brookings-metro/">库布鲁金斯</a>学会专门向<i>《大西洋</i>月刊》提供的新数据显示，事实上，投票反对拟议堕胎限制的县是推动本州经济增长最多的地方。根据我的要求，布鲁金斯都市报利用联邦经济分析局的数据计算了在最近的五场竞选中投票支持和反对堕胎权的县在州经济总产出中所占的份额。结果令人震惊：布鲁金斯学会发现，支持堕胎权的县占密歇根州国内生产总值的五分之四以上，堪萨斯州的四分之三以上，俄亥俄州的四分之三以上，以及密歇根州的五分之三以上。肯塔基州和威斯康星州。<br><br>布鲁金斯学会高级研究员罗伯特·马克西姆告诉我：“我们不仅关注两种不同的政治制度，而且关注同一州内的两种不同经济体。”<br><br>俄亥俄州的投票再次表明，堕胎正在扩大这些不同制度之间的断层线，并对选举产生明显的影响。由于担心共和党会试图禁止堕胎，民主党在 2022 年选举中在亚利桑那州、内华达州、佐治亚州、密歇根州、宾夕法尼亚州和威斯康星州等关键摇摆州，特别是在大城市周边教育程度较高的郊区，取得了出人意料的良好表现。尽管人们对经济和乔·拜登总统的工作表现普遍不满，但民主党赢得了这些州六场州长竞选中的四场和五场美国参议院竞选中的四场。即使到 2024 年选民在这两个方面仍然不满意，民主党战略家仍持谨慎乐观态度，认为对共和党试图实施全国堕胎禁令的恐惧仍将是拜登和党内其他候选人的强大资产。<br><br>当有机会直接参与这个问题时，各种规模社区的选民都表现出了对禁止堕胎的抵制。正如<i>《华盛顿邮报》</i>的菲利普·邦普 (Philip Bump) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/09/ohio-abortion-vote-analysis/">本周计算的</a>那样，自去年以来就堕胎问题进行投票的 510 个县中，有 500 个县中支持堕胎权的选民比例超过了拜登 (佛蒙特州除外，邦普并未将佛蒙特州包括在内)在他的分析中）。<br><br>但在这些州中，大多数较小的县仍然投票反对合法堕胎，包括上周在俄亥俄州的投票。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cleveland.com/politics/2023/08/ohios-issue-1-results-how-turnout-in-urban-counties-slippage-in-rurals-cost-republicans.html">克利夫兰<i>平原经销商</i>对结果的综合分析</a>发现，在俄亥俄州的农村县，超过五分之三的选民仍然支持第一个问题。<br><br>第一个问题的反对者在该州最大的城市和郊区县以巨大的优势克服了持续的阻力。本周投票最多的 17 个县中，有 14 个县的大多数选民拒绝了第一期，其中包括投票绝对最多的所有七个县（ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/08/us/elections/results-ohio-issue-1.html?name=styln-2023-elections&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;variant=undefined">根据<i>《纽约时报》</i>公布的排名</a>）。在其中几个县，选民以 2 比 1 甚至 3 比 1 的比例反对第一个问题。<br><br>同样引人注目的是主要城市周边郊区县的结果，几乎所有这些县通常都倾向于共和党。在特朗普于 2020 年赢得的几个郊区大县（包括特拉华州和洛兰县），绝大多数人反对第一个问题。即使在共和党支持率较高、特朗普获得超过 60% 选票的郊区县（巴特勒、沃伦和克莱蒙），第一个问题上的“赞成”派也仅以微弱优势获胜。那些大城市和郊区的投票率也很高。<br><br>长期驻俄亥俄州民主党顾问杰夫·鲁斯纳克 (Jeff Rusnak) 表示，郊区的表现可能标志着该党的重要转变。他认为，俄亥俄州比该地区其他州（尤其是密歇根州、宾夕法尼亚州和威斯康星州）更加坚定地支持共和党的原因之一是，在特朗普时代，俄亥俄州女性并没有像其他州的女性那样转向民主党。 。但是，他告诉我，如果独立女性甚至倾向共和党的女性没有显着改善，第一期的“反对”一方就不可能像在郊区大县那样表现得那么好。 “我认为，在俄亥俄州，那些不一定遵循五大湖州趋势的女性现在醒悟并意识到，<i>啊哈，我们最好采取行动</i>，”鲁斯纳克说。<br><br>俄亥俄州的结果遵循了自去年最高法院裁决以来其他州举行的选举直接影响堕胎权的明显模式。在堪萨斯州，堕胎权支持者赢得了投票最多的所有六个县。在肯塔基州和密歇根州的投票中，堕胎权支持者赢得了投票最多的 10 个县中的 8 个县，而在加利福尼亚州，他们赢得了投票总数最高的 14 个县。蒙大拿州没有像其他州那样多的城市中心，但其反堕胎投票措施因投票最多的三个县的多数反对而被否决。在今年春天的威斯康星州最高法院竞选中，民主党人珍妮特·普罗塔谢维奇 (Janet Protasiewicz <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-2024-races/673567/">) 的竞选核心是异常明确地承诺支持合法堕胎</a>，她赢得了 10 个投票率最高的县中的 7 个县。 （所有这些数据均来自<i>《纽约时报》</i>对各州县的排名。）对于希望在城市和郊区社区重新站稳脚跟的共和党人来说，堕胎已经成为“一个巨大的挑战，因为他们确实站在了错误的一边”。马凯特法学院民意调查主任查尔斯·富兰克林告诉我，“这些选民的问题” <b>。</b><br><br>这些堕胎投票的结果反映了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://qz.com/13018/the-class-inversion-how-american-politics-turned-upside-down">我所说的美国政治中的“阶级倒置”</a> 。这就是现代动态，民主党<a data-event-element="inline link"

Davis）向我描述了这一过程，即共和党人用“乡村俱乐部换取国家”。在一些州，用大城市郊区的利润减少换取小城镇和农村地区扩大的优势，明显改善了共和党的地位。田纳西州、肯塔基州和阿肯色州以及德克萨斯州、爱荷华州、蒙大拿州以及北卡罗来纳州等州都是如此。俄亥俄州也完全属于这一类别，共和党在蓝领选民中的支持率上升，特别是在该州东部边境沿线的县，推动该州从典型的 20 世纪末摇摆州转变为目前共和党的堡垒。<br><br>但这种重新配置同样明显伤害了其他州的共和党人，例如本世纪初的科罗拉多州和弗吉尼亚州，以及最近的亚利桑那州和佐治亚州。最大社区的实力不断增强，甚至让民主党在特朗普于 2016 年从“蓝墙”中逐出的三个关键铁锈带州中重新获得了优势：密歇根州、宾夕法尼亚州和威斯康星州。<br><br> 2022 年，民主党横扫了所有三个州的州长职位，并赢得了宾夕法尼亚州的参议院竞选。对合法堕胎的支持是所有这些胜利的核心：根据爱迪生进行的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/exit-polls">出口民意调查，</a>每个州超过五分之三的选民表示堕胎在所有或大多数情况下都应该保持合法，其中绝大多数人支持民主党候选人媒体联盟的研究。亚利桑那州的数字几乎相同，略多于五分之三的选民也支持堕胎权，其中绝大多数支持获胜的民主党州长和美国参议员候选人。<br><br>这些竞选清楚地表明，对于堕胎大多仍然合法的偏蓝或紫色州的民主党人来说，保护堕胎权是 2022 年的一个重要问题。但是， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/abortion-midterm-voters-politics-democrats-republicans-fault-lines/index.html">正如我所写</a>，事实证明，这个问题在那些禁止堕胎的更加坚定的红色倾向州中影响力要小得多：通过严格堕胎禁令的共和党州长和立法者在德克萨斯州、佐治亚州和佛罗里达州等州赢得了连任。出口民意调查发现，在那些更可靠的共和党州，即使是极少数自称支持堕胎的选民也更加重视其他问题，其中包括犯罪和移民，并支持签署堕胎限制或禁令的共和党州长。<br><br>俄亥俄州与任何州一样有力地体现了这一趋势。尽管出口民调显示近五分之三的选民表示堕胎在所有或大多数情况下都应保持合法，但共和党州长迈克·德温在签署该州为期六周的堕胎禁令后以压倒性优势赢得连任。出口民意调查发现，支持全国堕胎禁令的共和党人万斯（JD Vance）去年在俄亥俄州参议院竞选中获胜，吸引了约三分之一自称选民的选票，这些选民表示他们支持堕胎权。<br><br>俄亥俄州民主党参议员谢罗德·布朗 (Sherrod Brown) 面临 2024 年连任，他的命运可能取决于他是否能像民主党去年在密歇根州、宾夕法尼亚州和亚利桑那州等州那样赢得更多支持堕胎权的选民。 。 （同样的情况也可能发生在倾向共和党的蒙大拿州，该州的民主党参议员乔恩·泰斯特去年否决了一项反堕胎投票倡议。）<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/abortion-rights-issue-2024-election/674504/">阅读：这是堕胎，笨蛋</a><br><br>布朗有一些乐观的理由。上周第一个问题失败后，11 月份恢复该州堕胎权的后续投票倡议将使该问题继续成为焦点。反对布朗的两位主要共和党候选人都是坚定的堕胎反对者。 Secretary of State Frank LaRose, the probable front-runner in the GOP race, was the chief public advocate for last week&#39;s failed initiative.最令布朗感到鼓舞的是，该州最大的郊区县对第一个问题投的“反对”票不仅远远超过了拜登 2020 年在同一地点的表现，也远远超过了布朗在 2018 年上一次连任时的表现。<br><br>对于布朗以及明年竞争激烈的全州竞选中的几乎每一位民主党人来说，胜利之路都取决于在如此大的城市和郊区县的强劲表现。鉴于对经济的不满情绪持续存在，对拜登来说，在极少数可能决定白宫控制权的州中，在支持堕胎权的郊区选民中获得巨大优势尤为重要。本周第一期的惨败再次表明，共和党人热衷于废除合法堕胎权，已经向拜登和其他民主党人提供了最有力的论据来感动这些选民。<br><br></div>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>伊丽莎白·拉什</figcaption></figure>Out on the bow of the R/V Nathaniel B. Palmer, the air is dense and almost warm.我们已经穿过了数英里长的南极浮冰，到达了阿蒙森海雾蒙蒙的内陆地区。我想纪念我们与思韦茨冰川崩解前沿之间的剩余距离——许多科学家认为这个地方可能会对全球海平面造成灾难性影响，但截至 2019 年 2 月的此时此刻，从未有人访问过这个地方。船——但我真的不知道除了站在这里还能做什么。就在左舷处：一座半翻转的金字塔形状的冰山。它看起来就像一座废墟，时间已经部分消除了一些东西——水线以下的东西被海水的热量逐渐消失，曾经沉没的冰像玻璃一样光滑。<br><br>那天晚上，我睡不着觉。我经常醒来，每次都希望我们已经到达。最后，大约五点钟，我起床了。拖着脚步爬上将我的小屋和桥隔开的五层楼梯。外面，思韦茨的灰色边缘在半明半暗的光线中晃动。<br><br>我们沿着它蜿蜒前行，进入小海湾，绕过奇怪的海角。为了守住这条危险的防线，我们的步伐很慢。冰面像沙丘一样柔软。夜晚新的黑暗渐渐被破晓的曙光所取代，许多其他人似乎都在关注着船上 56 名科学家和船员中的每一位都在为之奋斗了数周、数年，在某些情况下，十多年来——成为人们关注的焦点。我们不说话；相反，我们就像在某个超凡脱俗的存在面前一样窃窃私语。最后，我们凝视着思韦茨的边缘，直到几个月前，乘船还无法到达这里。自从人类开始记录以来（可能是数千年来），海水第一次融化到足以让船只直接航行到冰川的冰面。大副里克·维姆肯（Rick Wiemken）专心地掌管着帕尔默号，船长就在他旁边，引导我们沿着思韦茨深不可测的裂缝边缘、它的牛奶般出血的心脏前进。<br><br>如果南极洲本世纪要向海洋倾倒大量冰，那么这些冰很可能来自思韦茨。这是因为冰川位于海平面以下，其底部暴露在温水入侵之下，导致冰川下方快速融化。卫星图像显示，它每年损失 500 亿吨冰，相当于胡夫大金字塔的约 8,000 倍。换句话说：仅思韦茨冰川就可能导致海平面上升超过两英尺，如果它完全解体，可能会破坏南极西部冰盖的大部分稳定，导致全球海平面跃升 10 英尺或更多。十英尺将摧毁纽约、雅加达、孟买和波士顿的大片地区，以及许多较小但同样重要的地方。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/watch-video-one-worlds-most-important-places/605731/">阅读：地球上最可怕的地方之一的新视频</a><br><br>但我们对思韦茨了解得越多，就越深刻地认识到，我们对海平面上升速度的许多预测都是极其脆弱的。作为第一批调查世界上最宽冰川崩解边缘的人，我们的使命是带回尽可能多的初步信息。返回后，这些数据将用于开始完善我们的气候变化模型，并为国际思韦茨冰川合作组织 (ITGC) 的剩余几年制定战略。例如，它将<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05586-0">为发表在<em>《自然》杂志</em>上的</a>两项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0">研究</a>提供信息，这些研究表明，虽然思韦茨底部的融化速度比之前想象的要慢，但冰中深层且迅速扩大的裂缝可能会引发冰架的崩塌。换句话说：在地球寒冷的最低点，思韦茨继续走出我们想象的剧本，甚至违背了我们对未来最详细的预测。<br><br>几乎船上的每个人都在思韦茨的阴影下在舰桥上度过了第一天。我们在困难中站在一起，试图看看摆在我们面前的是什么。一块悬臂板悬在水面上，就像巨型蛤蜊的扇贝壳，上面布满了最近温暖的日子里形成的冰柱。我设置相机拍摄一系列延时照片。百叶窗打开又关闭，打开又关闭。艺术评论家约翰·伯杰的名言“眼见先于言辞”浮现在我的脑海中。他认为，看也是被看，在他人的眼中想象自己。从冰川的角度看我们是什么样子？我们航行经过的那个早晨，在冰川时期，只不过是一个小插曲。<br><br>在里面，伙伴们在纸质地图上追踪帕尔默号的行进情况。根据他们微弱的铅笔痕迹，我们目前位于思韦茨冰川舌的顶部。早在 1991 年，当该图表印刷时，该区域已被冻结，是东部冰架的一部分，向阿蒙森海延伸数英里。里克叫我到导航控制台查看帕尔默号的电子航向绘图系统。在屏幕上的图像中，水呈蓝色，冰架呈灰色，我们航行的地方呈白色且“无名”，未被访问过。<br><br>首席科学家罗布·拉特（Rob Larter）正忙着观看实时显示海底深度的监视器。<br><br> “深度超过 1,000 米，”他说。 “比重力反演模型预测的更深。”就像这样，在我们的第一个早晨，我们就有了一个发现：冰川下流淌的水量可能比我们想象的要多。<br><br>我冲向厨房，狼吞虎咽地吃下两个煮鸡蛋和半个肉桂面包，然后跑回来，一次走两个楼梯。很快我又到了外面，尽量少看别处。思韦茨的崩解边缘绵延不到 100 英里，因此我们需要几个小时才能走完全程。有时，边缘显得陡峭、坚固、陡峭；有时，边缘显得陡峭、坚固、陡峭。在其他地方，它失去了光泽，显得白垩且破旧。我们拐过一个拐角，脸猛地冲向墙壁。 A wild line twists along the top of the shelf, tracing gorges into the blue-white snow.然后，同样突然地，护墙崩塌了，水面上漂浮着碎冰。<br><br>当我们到达思韦茨时，一个开关翻转了。我们不再像旅程开始时那样“保持忙碌”。不再有桑拿俱乐部或桥牌课程。不再需要在货舱里打乒乓球或在午夜享用国王蛋糕。重要的是数据。泥浆样本、海底深度、温度读数和波浪作用；我们甚至保存海冰观测的实时日志。假设，每个不同的团队将他们的一天一分为二：有些人从中午工作到午夜，另一些人从午夜工作到中午。但大多数人只有在滑冰到接近精神错乱的危险时才会休息。<br><br>我们不间断地劳动了近一周。<br><br>然后事情又发生了变化。<br><br>在干燥的实验室里，罗布弯腰伏在他的银色笔记本电脑上。他打开了两扇窗户，并在它们之间来回敲击。两者都包含研究区域的航空图像，这是一周多以来首次在船上传送卫星信息。其中，思韦茨的西线是一座坚固的壁垒。在另一张照片中，看起来好像有人用棒球棒击打挡风玻璃。罗布在两者之间切换。具有凝聚力的架子。爆炸的北极星。一个可通航的海湾，然后同一个入口散布着超现实的冰山五彩纸屑。<br><br> “The morning we arrived, we cruised right along the edge of the shelf,” I say, looking at the first image. “它非常光滑，是一堵坚固的冰墙。有一些褶皱和塌陷，但是——”<br><br> “但在过去的几天里，我们正南方的思韦茨冰锋似乎确实大量释放了冰山，”罗布说，结束了我的想法。他困惑地用干燥的手掌摸了摸沾满泥泞的裤子。我的胃里一阵奇怪的颤动，一半是恐惧，一半是兴奋。这也是我们来到这里的原因：见证我们以前只能用文字想象的拆解，用远程卫星图像产生的计算，用数学模型。看来，这种解体就在我们面前展开。<br><br> “这看起来几乎和拉森 B 号坍塌一样戏剧性，”罗布说。 （我当时在<em>《国家地理》杂志</em>上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/watching-thwaites-glacier-calving-antarctica">报道了</a>他的反应。）他指的是人类历史上有记录的最大的冰架崩塌例子之一。 2002 年，通过航空卫星图像监测半岛的科学家们既惊讶又恐惧地看到拉森 B 冰架（大约相当于罗德岛州大小的一块）在不到两个月的时间内崩塌了。在塌陷后的几年里，冰进入海湾的速度比以前快了八倍，这证明当陆架崩解时，它所控制的冰川可以将更多的质量倾倒到海洋中。这意味着在这次崩溃之后的几天和几年里，思韦茨的流动也可能会加速。<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-022-01019-9">我们的任务数据</a>表明，在过去几个世纪的某个时候，思韦茨的退缩速度比我们今天看到的速度快两到三倍，这表明可能会有更严重的冰损失。 （四年半过去了，仍然没有对冰解后几年的冰损失率进行全面的研究。）<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/climate-change-tipping-points/674778/">阅读：气候崩溃可能会很快发生</a><br><br>罗布褪色的连身裤的褶皱在实验室的荧光灯下显得有些漂白。他亮蓝色的眼睛下面的灰色眼袋下垂了。他再次从一张图像点击到另一张图像，并不由自主地发出叹息和咕哝之间的声音。<br><br> “您是否曾经在一艘船上，在您工作的区域发生过如此戏剧性的事情？”我终于问了。毕竟，这是 Rob 第 20 次来到南极洲。<br><br> “我没有，没有，”他平静地说。<br><br>我们在这个无名海湾的所有剩余工作都被取消了。我们在思韦茨西部工作了不到一周的时间：这是我们唯一的时间。现在一切都结束了。<br><br>在舰桥上，二副一边听着速度金属乐，一边引导我们远离塌方的雷区。最终我走到外面，转了一整圈，但很少看到地平线，因为大海里充满了刚刚崩解的冰山。近十年来我一直想看到冰川的诞生。在我的脑海里，冰块会吱吱作响，船的甲板会颤抖，尘埃云会升入明亮的蓝色天空，水墙会向我们涌来。目睹如此崩溃，怎能不转变？<br><br>但这与我的预期完全不同。没有劈开的悬崖面。没有狂喜的回声。我又转了一圈。在我的右边，一座冰山比我任教的大学校园还要大。在它的后面，另一个，另一个。有些有柔软的白色鼻子，有些则有光泽，边缘在阳光下闪闪发光。当北极的冰川后退或涌动时，那些与冰一起生活的人表示，它正在传递一个信息。自从我知道思韦茨的名字以来，我就想象着收到这样的信息，它破裂的这一刻将作为警告响彻我的身体。但我从来没有考虑过裂缝会大到我都不知道它们是裂缝的可能性。我无法区分冰山和架子，区分完整的东西和破碎的东西。我在记忆中寻找崩溃的迹象，寻找某种——任何——戏剧性的东西。 Just this morning, I asked one of the researchers onboard about the bergs, and yes, she confirmed that they came from Thwaites.我想，如果我们一天前到达，我们就会相信事情本来就是这样的。<br><br><small>本文改编自伊丽莎白·拉什即将出版的新书<a

Bruen</i></a> that the constitutionality of modern gun laws depends on whether they are “consistent with this Nation&#39;s historical tradition of firearm regulation.”换句话说，任何现代枪支法的宪法标准都归结为你是否能在 1700 年代或 1800 年代找到一个好的先例。<br><br>支持者的假设是，这样的先例很少见，但由于研究人员的工作和档案材料的数字化，现在可以参考数千条旧枪支法，各种可以想象的种类。枪支管制法规在美国历史上绝非罕见，而是默认法规。如果<i>布鲁恩案</i>的目的是废除许多枪支法的宪法基础，那么它应该会失败。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/gun-violence-scotus-bruen-ruling-mass-shootings/672446/">Ryan Busse: One nation under guns</a><br><br>由于殖民时期早期原住民与欧洲定居者之间不断发生冲突，几乎每个殖民地<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/repository/search-results/?_sf_s=indian">都颁布了与詹姆斯敦类似的法律</a>，以防止枪支落入“敌对者”之手，但这些法律通常是无效的。在接下来的两个世纪里，直到内战之前，对奴隶叛乱的普遍恐惧促使许多殖民地以及后来的州颁布法律<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/02/1002107670/historian-uncovers-the-racist-roots-of-the-2nd-amendment">阻止</a>他们获得枪支。然而，内战前时期的枪支法规并不全是禁令：至少有 11 个州颁布了许可法，通常在某种形式的监督下允许奴役和自由黑人携带武器。<br><br>在共和国历史的这段漫长时期中，直到 20 世纪初， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/guns-across-america-reconciling-gun-rules-and-rights-robert-spitzer/9780190228583?affiliate_id=atl-347">枪支法</a>对各类公民——特别是契约仆人、流浪者、非新教徒、拒绝向政府、重罪犯、外国人、未成年人和受酒精影响的人宣誓效忠。许多法律规范狩猎行为以及枪支的携带、使用、储存和运输；规范枪支的制造、检验、储存和销售；征收枪支许可证；以及受限制的危险或不寻常武器。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/freedmen-race-neutral-supreme-court-affirmative-action-clarence-thomas/674641/">Adam Serwer：最高法院法官提出的最令人困惑的论点</a><br><br>尽管托马斯意见声称“历史记录显示在 18 世纪和 19 世纪完全禁止使用武器的‘敏感地点’相对较少”，但一些地方当局也禁止在城镇、建筑物或道路内或附近开枪。例如天黑后、周日、公共集会和墓地。在某些司法管辖区，任何使用浪费火药的枪支的行为也构成犯罪。<br><br>对违反这些法律的典型处罚是罚款和监禁的结合。在 1700 年代和 1800 年代，由于 1791 年第二修正案的通过和 1868 年第十四修正案的增加，这是法官们主要关注的时期，违反枪支携带和狩猎法也可能导致没收。<br><br>当然，其中一些法律解决了当时特有的问题。例如，从 1600 年代到 1800 年代中期，对保存火药的担忧<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4007491">非常重要</a>，因为它的相对稀缺性使其成为一种珍贵的物质，无论数量如何，手头持有都是危险的，如果储存或处理不当，它很快就会降解。然而，其他类型的法律更直接地对应于现代枪支法规。<br><br>以在公共场合携带枪支或其他危险武器为例。早在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/the-grants-concessions-and-original-constitutions-of-the-province-of-new-jersey-page-289-290-image-293-294-1881-available-at-the-making-of-modern-law-primary-sources/">1686 年</a>，新泽西州就颁布了一项法律，禁止任何“私下佩戴任何袖珍手枪、绞绳、细高跟鞋、匕首或短剑，或其他不寻常或非法武器”的人，因为它们会引起“极大的恐惧和争吵”。这项法律还警告贵族们不要进行我们现在所说的公开携带：“任何<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncpedia.org/gentry">种植园主</a>不得骑马或携带剑、手枪或匕首，否则将受到处罚。”新罕布什尔州于 1744 年通过了一项法律，对任何“携带棍棒或其他武器（包括火器）”且拒绝驱散的十几人或以上的非法集会进行处罚。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1749-51-mass-acts-339-an-act-for-preventing-and-suppressing-of-riots-routs-and-unlawful-assemblies-chap-12-%c2%a7-1/">1751 年</a>，马萨诸塞州也效仿了这一做法。弗吉尼亚州和北卡罗来纳州分别于<a

年</a>通过了类似的禁止公开携带武器的法律。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=4825&amp;context=lcp">在革命后的 1800 年代</a>，随着暴力犯罪的增加导致更多的人武装自己，共有 42 个州（加上哥伦比亚特区）颁布了禁止隐藏携带武器的法律。 1900 年代初又有三个州这样做，因此总数几乎涵盖了联邦的每个州。从 1700 年代到 1900 年代，许多国家也颁布了某种形式的武器许可法。<br><br>那不是全部。同一时期，至少有 22 个州限制携带枪支，包括长枪。此外，在整个时期，四分之三的州制定了禁止“挥舞”（以威胁或威胁的方式挥舞枪支）或仅仅在公共场合展示武器的法律。<br><br>对于现代美国人来说，隐蔽携带就等同于携带手枪。但在 1700 年代和 1800 年代，单发手枪不可靠且不准确，格斗刀成为主要问题。其中最臭名昭著的是鲍伊刀，以吉姆·鲍伊 (Jim Bowie) 的名字命名，据说在 1827 年的一场<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/jim-bowie-stabs-a-louisiana-banker-with-his-famous-knife">战斗</a>中，吉姆·鲍伊 (Jim Bowie) 使用其兄弟雷辛·鲍伊 (Rezin Bowie) 送给他的一把“大刀”杀死了一名男子并打伤了另一名男子。 1836 年这位冒险家在德克萨斯州阿拉莫的死亡事件进一步放大了这种现象，这<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gunandswordcollector.com/product/bowie-knife-norm-flayderman/">刺激了对这把刀的需求</a>，但也刺激了禁止携带这把刀的法律的颁布。 1830 年代，至少有 6 个州通过了此类法律；到本世纪末，除了一个州外，每个州都限制了鲍伊刀。<br><br> <a

<a data-event-element="inline link"

there is an undeniable resonance to having the daughter of a German Jewish refugee represent US interests in Berlin.<br><br>但我怀疑古特曼作为公共知识分子所取得的巨大成就或她的祖先联系并不是为她赢得美国最负盛名的大使任命之一的。更可能的解释是，总统觉得自己欠她一份感激之情，因为她给了他一些比超级政治行动委员会最令人眼花缭乱的巨额捐款更珍贵的东西。<br><br>在担任新职务之前，古特曼曾担任宾夕法尼亚大学校长 18 年，她因出色的筹款活动和战略敏锐性而受到赞誉，并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2023/06/penn-amy-gutmann-university-president-salary">获得了丰厚的报酬</a>。值得注意的是，她<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/spotlights/vice-president-joe-biden-lead-penn-biden-center-diplomacy-and-global-engagement">于2017年2月</a>主持成立了宾夕法尼亚大学拜登外交和全球参与中心，该中心最初由乔·拜登领导，乔·拜登同时被任命为宾夕法尼亚大学本杰明·富兰克林总统实践教授。<br><br>拥有一位前副总统并不是一件小事，古特曼和拜登似乎已经建立了牢固的关系。 2018年，当拜登的孙女梅西·拜登申请宾夕法尼亚大学入学时，他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://freebeacon.com/biden-administration/joe-biden-wants-to-crack-down-on-privilege-in-education-he-called-upenns-president-to-get-his-granddaughter-in/">亲自介入，</a>向古特曼提出了她的情况，而古特曼似乎为这位前副总统提供了关于提高她的机会的宝贵建议。尽管学业成绩不理想，小拜登还是于 2019 年秋天进入了宾夕法尼亚大学，并于今年春天毕业。那时，古特曼已经在柏林安顿下来了。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Annie Lowrey：为什么你必须关心这 12 所大学</a><br><br>我并不嫉妒拜登竭尽全力让他的孙女考入一所名牌大学，这是一种令人钦佩的祖父般的奉献精神，也不嫉妒古特曼接受了他的恳求，因为她的工作在很大程度上是为了给他的孙女增添光彩。宾夕法尼亚大学。尽管如此，他们之间的关系仍然引人注目。人们通常会期望大学校长对美国前副总统表现出关心，而不是相反。<br><br>但古特曼并不是任何一所大学的校长。她是常春藤联盟大学的校长，这让一切变得不同。她与拜登家族的关系是常春藤盟校及其同行机构巨大影响力的完美升华，并且表明了这种影响力可能会如何消失。<br><br>凭借数十亿美元的捐赠，美国最优秀的大学在近几十年来已将自己转变为美国大众富裕人群的“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/henry-v/read/5/2/">礼仪制造者</a>”。通过将富人和有权势的孩子与指定弱势群体的孩子混合在一起，他们产生了新的进步精英，对国家的文化和政治生活拥有巨大的影响力。现在，随着常春藤+的招生实践受到左翼和右翼的严格审查，这种强大的炼金术正面临风险，为一批新的精英培养机构打开了大门。<br><br>古特曼杰出的前任美国驻德国大使之一是詹姆斯·布莱恩特·科南特（James Bryant Conant），他曾担任美国驻德国高级专员，然后在冷战初期担任美国首任驻德国大使。与之类似的是，科南特在担任哈佛大学校长 20 年后担任了这一职位。<br><br>在科南特时代和古特曼时代之间，美国的精英高等教育达到了其权力的顶峰。但科南特对哈佛大学的愿景和古特曼对宾夕法尼亚大学的愿景截然不同。<br><br>科南特出身于波士顿的工人阶级童年，他曾致力于将哈佛从一所 WASP 精英的精修学校转变为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-big-test-the-secret-history-of-the-american-meritocracy-nicholas-lemann/9780374527518?affiliate_id=atl-347">一所更加精英化的机构</a>，他要求大学管理人员找到一种能力倾向测试，以选拔全美最聪明、最优秀的人才。有能力的年轻人，这构成了后来SAT的基础。他相信哈佛可以帮助实现“杰斐逊的理想”，即一个由热心公益的知识精英领导的国家，这些精英是通过严格的、基于证据的程序选出的。对于许多美国人来说，科南特论文的某些版本是哈佛大学和类似机构地位提升的最令人信服的理由，这就是为什么背离精英理想往往会破坏常春藤联盟精英的合法性。<br><br>这种<i>精英主义的精英主义</i>从未在实践中得到充分实现，尤其是在常春藤盟校。其一，科南特本人主持了犹太人的配额制度，他被指责<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/194316">至少</a>对反犹太主义的祸害漠不关心。此后的几十年里，一大批大学管理者放弃了精英统治，转而建立了一种不同的、可以说更强大的精英基础。精英高等教育不再一心关注学术卓越，而是采取了更加多元化的方法，将仅根据学术证书选择的学生与其他旨在丰富大学生活的学生混合在一起，无论是象征性的还是字面意义上的。在这一时期的大部分时间里，这些对精英管理范式的背离被视为对筹款和其他平淡的制度目标的必要性的让步。然而，近年来，这种招生多元化品牌在道德上发生了转变。称之为<i>进步精英主义</i>。<br><br> 1995 年 5 月，时任劳伦斯·S·洛克菲勒大学政治学教授兼普林斯顿大学教务长的古特曼在斯坦福大学发表了备受尊敬的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_resources/documents/a-to-z/g/Gutmann96.pdf">坦纳人类价值观讲座</a>。她的言论集中在种族不平等上，她称之为“这个国家公共生活中在道德和智力上最令人烦恼的问题”。<br><br>古特曼的核心论点之一是，因为“有效解决种族不公正问题的公共政策和个人实践是集体利益”，“黑人批评那些从他们打击种族不公正的努力中受益但无所作为的其他黑人是公平合理的”帮助这一事业或同样紧迫的事业。”也就是说，美国黑人“需要团结起来，通过支持平权行动政策等方式打击种族不平等”。<br><br>古特曼认为，不仅仅是美国黑人在这一领域负有特殊义务。 “我们承受的种族负担越少，”她认为，“我们克服种族不平等的义务就越大。”非黑人美国人“负有与种族不公正作斗争的特殊义务，以减少他们成为不公平优势受益者的可能性，这些不公平优势源于社会职务的种族成见和其他形式的制度化不公正，使黑人不公平地处于不利地位。”<br><br>如果古特曼是对的，即优势个人和群体有特殊义务避免加剧种族不平等的不公平优势，那么我们应该如何理解拜登总统为确保他的孙女进入宾夕法尼亚大学而做出的共同努力——或者更确切地说，我们应该如何期待政治哲学家艾米·古特曼明白吗？<br><br>一个可能的解决方案是，为达到目的不择手段。也就是说，如果特权阶层有利于种族和社会正义的更大事业，那么他们利用自己的地位、关系和财富来获得高地位的教育机会是合理且适当的。<br><br>处于古特曼立场的人可能会坚持认为，因为她控制的机构与她和她的同龄人认为值得的事业保持一致，所以招收能够增强其中心地位和声望的学生本身就是一种崇高的追求。对平等主义的承诺不仅赋予宾夕法尼亚大学和类似的大学道德许可，而且赋予他们以国家最有特权家庭的子孙来强化学生群体的道德义务。这样做为像古特曼这样的进步大学校长提供了塑造美国新一代精英的强大工具。<br><br>至关重要的是，这个精英塑造项目需要一个更广泛接受的合法性理论。如果说精英精英主义的合理性在于需要向最优秀、最聪明的人灌输爱国主义和公民责任感，那么进步精英主义的合理性在于需要使美国精英多元化。这意味着增加美国黑人和其他历史上处于不利地位的群体在美国公共生活中扮演重要角色的代表性，但这也意味着保护和加强常春藤盟校作为机会瓶颈的作用。在进步精英主义的影响下，常春藤盟校不仅仅是王朝财富与第一代奋斗者的活力交汇的地方。这是美国精英获得道义认可的地方。<br><br><i>学生公平招生诉哈佛</i>案揭示了这种精英培养方法在实践中的运作方式。学生公平招生是一个反对种族偏好的非营利性法律倡导组织，它聘请杜克大学劳动经济学家彼得·阿尔西迪亚科诺（Peter Arcidiacono）来分析谁被哈佛录取，谁没有被哈佛录取，并利用了该校多年来有义务与他人分享的严密保护的数据。原告。他的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Glenn_Loury/louryhomepage/teaching/Affirmative_Action/Meeting_V/supporting_documents/Doc%20415-8%20-%20(Arcidiacono%20Expert%20Report).pdf">专家证词</a>揭示了该大学的招生做法在多大程度上使亚裔美国申请者处于不利地位，这激起了保守派对种族意识招生的批评。阿西迪亚科诺和他的合著者还<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26316">提请注意</a>哈佛大学对招募的运动员、遗产、院长感兴趣名单上的未来学生以及教职员工子女 (ALDC) 的偏好，在某些情况下，这种偏好非常大。<br><br>对阿尔西迪亚科诺的发现感到震惊，批评者和种族意识招生的拥护者联合起来谴责对 ALDC 的偏好，这是跨意识形态一致的罕见例子。但种族偏好和对 ALDC 的偏好从根本上来说是互补的，正是这种互补性成为进步精英主义的基石。<br><br>越来越多的证据表明，精英教育的主要优势不是教学质量，而是它提供的与有权势人士建立关系的机会。在<i>《纽约时报》</i>最近的一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/opinion/alumni-affirmative-action-legacy-admissions.html">专栏文章</a>中，普林斯顿大学社会学家沙姆斯·汗 (Shamus Khan) 描述了来自特权阶层和弱势背景的学生的社会联系如何能够为后者带来好处。<br><br>汗写道：“从精英学校毕业，你可以加入一个杰出的组织，为你提供与身居高位的朋友的联系，并让你适应高地位环境的惯例和礼仪。”但是，虽然来自特权背景的学生甚至在进入哈佛或宾夕法尼亚大学等院校之前就可以接触到富裕、受过教育、有专业成就的成年人的网络，但地位较低的学生却不能。当这些学生聚集在一起时，那些享有特权的学生会获得一种被认可的感觉——他们的智力、成就和性格——而那些地位较低的学生则获得社会和文化资本，从而加速他们大学毕业后的职业提升。<br><br>尽管可汗并不是传统偏好的捍卫者，但他观察到，“传统学生拥有深厚的社会和文化联系，是弱势学生从精英学校获得如此多好处的部分原因。”这种逻辑不仅适用于传统学生，也适用于其他特权学生，包括杰出民选官员的子孙、主要慈善家、学术和文化名人，甚至可能还有成就斐然的马术运动员和壁球运动员。<br><br>进步精英主义不仅仅塑造精英大学学生的举止、道德和生活轨迹。它使招生人员能够更大规模地参与灵魂艺术。<br><br> 2010 年，经济学家瓦莱丽·拉米 (Valerie Ramey) 和加里·拉米 (Garey Ramey) 发现，自 20 世纪 90 年代中期以来，名牌大学入学<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2010a_bpea_ramey.pdf">竞争的加剧</a>导致受过大学教育的美国父母投入到孩子成长上的时间和资源急剧增加。相比之下，加拿大家长之间的竞争并没有相应增加，因为加拿大高等教育的声望等级没有那么陡峭。雷米夫妇的结论是，这种激烈竞争的最终结果是一场浪费的、零和的“老鼠赛跑”。<br><br>在此实证基础上，散文家马特·菲尼走得更远。在他 2021 年出版的新书<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/little-platoons-a-defense-of-family-in-a-competitive-age-matt-feeney/9781541645592?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>《小排》</i></a>中，他谴责了选择性大学招生的傲慢态度，指责招生官员对有抱负的父母及其孩子的内心生活拥有非凡的权力。<br><br>菲尼认为，面对千禧一代成年后激增的申请，“招生人员开始认识到，这场比赛赋予他们的选择权也是一种深刻而微妙的道德力量……他们现在可以告诉申请者哪些课外活动是<i>更好</i>，以及在招生论文中哪种个人自白更令人愉悦，他们更喜欢什么样的人，正如这些论文和课外活动中所体现的那样。”通过向父母、老师、辅导员和极易受到地位小等级影响的焦虑的年轻奋斗者传达这些行为偏好，招生官员发现“他们现在可以诱导申请者成为这样的人。”<br><br>许多学者和从业者呼吁利用选择性大学招生的方式，以多种方式“推动”家长和学生。例如，2017 年，托马斯·斯科特-雷顿 (Thomas Scott-Railton) 在<i>《耶鲁法律与政策评论》</i>上发表了一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://yalelawandpolicy.org/shifting-scope-how-taking-school-demographics-account-college-admissions-could-reduce-k-12">具有挑衅性的文章</a>，敦促精英大学向就读于高贫困 K-12 学校的申请者提供大量入学奖金，即使他们不是来自低收入家庭。家庭本身的收入。他认为，“通过奖励就读社会经济一体化学校的申请者，大学将调动全国私人参与者的资源来实现一体化。”<br><br>撇开这一特定提案的优点不谈，它说明了精英高等教育对国家中产阶级及以上家庭的非凡影响力。斯科特-雷尔顿的提议可以被视为让常春藤联盟机构推进国会可能会拒绝的政策目标的一种做法。在文化多元化的社会中达成立法协议非常困难。赢得招生办公室的支持要轻松得多。<br><br>这种纪律权力具有意识形态特征，而且并不总是微妙的。 2018年，耶鲁大学的一名招生官员发布了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://admissions.yale.edu/bulldogs-blogs/hannah/2018/02/23/support-student-protests">一份说明</a>，安抚潜在申请者，并承认学生不会因参与枪支管制活动而受到高中停学或其他纪律处分。 “对于那些来到耶鲁大学的学生，”她写道，“我们希望他们精通社会正义问题。”想象一下类似的便条，为耶鲁大学的潜在申请者参加“生命大游行”而欢呼——然后想象一下发布它的招生官员将受到的谴责。<br><br>结果是，精英大学招生的机会瓶颈在进步的管理者和招生官员的手中，变成了将进步的虔诚转化为精英社会规范的工具。<br><br>这让我们明白了为什么常春藤盟校的精英可能已经达到顶峰。<br><br>如果进步精英主义允许选择性大学将道德进步主义与作为其理想来源的精英主义调和起来，那么当常春藤盟校招生官员重塑社会规范的权力不再受到种族正义的呼吁时，会发生什么？自从最高法院的<i>“学生公平招生</i>”决定限制了种族偏好以来，遗产偏好就受到了猛烈的攻击，尤其是来自拜登政府的攻击，拜登政府已经对哈佛使用这种做法发起了<a

月宣布也将效仿</a>。如果沙姆斯·汗是对的，尽管针对弱势学生的精英教育的象征价值可能会在传统招生结束后持续存在，但其作为社会和文化资本来源的价值将大大削弱。<br><br> <a

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by The Atlantic. Sources: Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty.</figcaption></figure> When Donald Trump appeared last week in a Washington, DC, courtroom for his arraignment on federal election charges, the presiding judge gave the former president a few simple instructions for staying out of jail while he awaited trial.<br><br> Trump could not talk to potential witnesses about the case except through lawyers, Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya told him, and he could not commit a crime on the local, state, or federal level. Both are standard directives to defendants. But then Upadhyaya added a warning that seemed tailored a bit more specifically to the blustery politician standing before her: “I want to remind you,” the judge said, “it is a crime to intimidate a witness or retaliate against anyone for providing information about your case to the prosecution, or otherwise obstruct justice.”<br><br> When Upadhyaya asked Trump if he understood, he nodded. Fewer than 24 hours later, Trump appeared to flout that very warning—in its spirit if not its letter—by threatening his would-be foes in an all-caps post on Truth Social: “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I&#39;M COMING AFTER YOU!” Over the following week, he attacked a potential witness in the case, former Vice President Mike Pence (“delusional”); Special Counsel Jack Smith (“deranged”); and the federal judge assigned to oversee his case, Tanya Chutkan, an appointee of former President Barack Obama (Smith&#39;s “number one draft pick,” in Trump&#39;s words).<br><br> Trump&#39;s screeds highlight a challenge that will now fall to Chutkan to confront: constraining a defendant who&#39;s both a former president and a leading candidate to take the White House—and who seems bent on making a mockery of his legal process.<br><br> “She&#39;s in a tight spot,” Barbara McQuade, a former US attorney in Michigan, says of Chutkan. Conceivably, the judge could find Trump in contempt of court and toss him in jail for violating the terms of his pretrial release. But even though in theory Trump should be treated like any other defendant, former prosecutors told me that he was exceedingly unlikely to go to prison over his pretrial statements. And Trump probably knows it. (Whether Trump will go to prison if he is convicted is another <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/08/04/trump-criminal-cases-prison-secret-service/">hotly debated</a> matter.)<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/04/donald-trump-indictment-arraignment-new-york/673617/">Read: The humiliation of Donald Trump</a><br><br> “I&#39;m sure she would be very reluctant to do that, in light of the fact that he&#39;s running for president,” McQuade told me. “So I think as a result, he has a very long leash, and I think he will simply dare her to revoke [his freedom] by saying the most outrageous things he can.”<br><br> At a pretrial hearing today, Chutkan issued her first warnings to Trump&#39;s lawyers about their client, according to reporting by Steven Portnoy of ABC News and Kyle Cheney of <em>Politico</em> . “Mr. Trump, like every American, has a First Amendment right to free speech,” she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/stevenportnoy/status/1690001911343095810">said</a> . “But that right is not absolute.” She said Trump&#39;s presidential candidacy would not factor into her decisions, and she rebuffed suggestions by a Trump lawyer, John Lauro, that the former president had a right to respond to his political opponents in the heat of a campaign. “He&#39;s a criminal defendant,” she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1690014529982222336">reminded</a> him. “He&#39;s going to have restrictions like every single other defendant.”<br><br> Chutkan said she would be scrutinizing Trump&#39;s words carefully, and she concluded with what she called “a general word of caution”: “Even arguably ambiguous statements from parties or their counsel,” the judge said, “can threaten the process.” She added: “I will take whatever measures are necessary to safeguard the integrity of these proceedings.”<br><br> Chutkan had called the hearing to determine whether to bar Trump and his lawyers from publicly disclosing evidence provided to them by prosecutors—a standard part of the pretrial process. The evidence includes millions of pages of documents and transcribed witness interviews from a year-long investigation, and the government argued that Trump or his lawyers could undermine the process by making them public before the trial. Despite her warnings to Trump&#39;s team, she sided with the defense&#39;s request to narrow the restrictions on what they could disclose, and she did not add other constraints on what he could say about the case.<br><br> Yet the effect of Chutkan&#39;s courtroom comments was to put Trump on notice. If he continues to flout judicial warnings, she could place a more formal gag order on him, the ex-prosecutors said. And if he ignores that directive, she would likely issue additional warnings before considering a criminal-contempt citation. A further escalation, McQuade said, would be to hold a hearing and order Trump to show cause for why he should not be held in contempt. “Maybe she gives him a warning, and she gives him another chance and another chance, but eventually, her biggest hammer” is to send him to jail.<br><br> Judges have sanctioned high-profile defendants in other cases recently. In 2019, the Trump ally Roger Stone was barred from posting on major social-media platforms after Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that he had violated a gag order she had issued. (Stone did honor this directive.) The Trump foe Michael Avenatti, who represented Stormy Daniels in her case against Trump and briefly considered challenging him for the presidency, was jailed shortly before his trial on extortion charges after prosecutors accused him of disregarding financial terms of his bail. “He was just scooped up and thrown into solitary,” one of his former lawyers, E. Danya Perry, told me. She said that Avenatti was thrown into the same jail cell that had held El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord. (Avenatti later <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/nyregion/michael-avenatti-trump-jail.html">claimed</a> that his treatment was payback ordered by then–Attorney General Bill Barr; the prison warden <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/22/michael-avenatti-rise-and-fall-house-arrest-profile-525301">said</a> he was placed in solitary confinement because of “serious concerns” about his safety, and Barr has called Avenatti&#39;s accusation “ridiculous.”)<br><br> Neither Stone nor Avenatti, however, is as high-profile as Trump, arguably the most famous federal defendant in American history. And Perry doubts that Chutkan would imprison him before a trial. Trump has ignored warnings from judges overseeing the various civil cases brought against him over the years and has never faced tangible consequences. “He has done it so many times and he has managed to skate so many times that he certainly is emboldened,” Perry said.<br><br> Indeed, Trump has also suggested he would ignore a gag order from Chutkan. “I will talk about it. I will. They&#39;re not taking away my First Amendment rights,” Trump <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/08/trump-on-possible-gag-order-pound-sand-00110357">told</a> a campaign rally in New Hampshire on Wednesday.<br><br> Trump&#39;s political motives for vilifying his prosecutors and once again portraying himself as the victim of a witch hunt are obvious: He&#39;s trying to rile up his Republican base. Trump also seems to be executing something of a legal strategy in his public statements about the trial. He&#39;s called Washington, DC, “a filthy and crime-ridden embarrassment,” possibly reasoning that these remarks will force the court to agree to his request to shift the trial to a venue with a friendlier population of potential jurors, such as West Virginia.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/">David A. Graham: Trump is acting like he&#39;s cornered</a><br><br> That&#39;s less likely to work, according to the former prosecutors I interviewed. “I&#39;d be shocked to see that be successful,” Noah Bookbinder, a former federal prosecutor who heads the anti-corruption advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told me. “It&#39;s sort of like the old joke about the child who kills his mother and father and then asks for mercy because he&#39;s an orphan. I just don&#39;t see a court going for that.”<br><br> Trump&#39;s attacks also present a problem for Smith, the special counsel. On one hand, prosecutors have a clear interest in ensuring that their witnesses do not feel intimidated; on the other, Smith could feel that trying to silence Trump would play into the former president&#39;s victim narrative. Justice Department prosecutors alerted Chutkan to Trump&#39;s “I&#39;m coming after you” post in a court filing, and during today&#39;s hearing they voiced concerns that if not restricted, Trump could disclose evidence to benefit his campaign. (A Trump spokesperson said the former president&#39;s warning was “the definition of political speech,” and that it referred to “special interest groups and Super PACs” opposing his candidacy.) But Smith&#39;s team did not ask Chutkan to fully gag Trump or even admonish him. “You see the prosecutors being very, very restrained,” Bookbinder said. “With a lot of defendants who were bad-mouthing the prosecutor and witnesses, they would have immediately gone in and asked for an order for the defendant to stop doing that.”<br><br> Bookbinder described the citation of Trump&#39;s post as “a brushback pitch” by the government, a signal that they are watching the former president&#39;s public statements closely. But like Chutkan, Smith might be reluctant to push the matter very far. Fighting with Trump over a gag order could distract from where the government wants to focus the case—on Trump&#39;s alleged crimes—and it could indulge his desire to drag out the trial, Bookbinder noted. But the special counsel has to weigh those concerns against the possibility that an out-of-control defendant could jeopardize the safety of prosecutors and witnesses. “My strong suspicion is that Jack Smith doesn&#39;t want to go there,” Bookbinder said. “I think at some point he may have little choice.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 11 Aug 2023 17:38:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/trump-arraignment-charges-judge-first-amendment/674993/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/trump-arraignment-charges-judge-first-amendment/674993/</item></channel></rss>
