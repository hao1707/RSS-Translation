referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>遗产艺术/盖蒂</figcaption></figure><span class="smallcaps">疫情初期，</span>我们见面变得更加困难。人脸，个性的终极标志，哲学家伊曼纽尔·列维纳斯（Emmanuel Levinas）称之为“第一次披露”，突然被织物包裹起来。街上遇到的陌生人更加陌生——遮住他们面容的面具成了投射焦虑想法的屏幕。<br><br>在出生于南非、现居伦敦北部的小说家黛博拉·利维 (Deborah Levy) 的最新著作<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/august-blue-deborah-levy/9780374602048?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>《八月蓝色》</i></a>中，一位名叫艾尔莎·安德森 (Elsa Anderson) 的音乐会钢琴家在雅典的跳蚤市场上瞥见一名戴着蓝色医用口罩的妇女正在购买一件俗气的小玩意——一对玩具机械马。 ——她莫名其妙地也非常想要自己得到它。由于无法完全看到这个女人的脸，艾莎开始相信她实际上在这个神秘而迷人的陌生人身上看到了她自己的某个版本，或者更确切地说，是某种分身。 “当时我的一个惊人想法是，我和她是同一个人。”<br><br>如果利维<i>没有</i>以 2020 年大封锁结束后的情况为背景创作一部小说，那么她的读者会感到惊讶，当时“每个人都显得茫然和沮丧”，尽管大流行最严重的时期已经过去。她总是用近代的决定性事件——柏林墙倒塌、金融危机、英国脱欧——作为她故事的配乐。生活在历史性混乱中所带来的流离失所和不安感，赋予了她的书一种威胁的边缘，并暗示着其相对简短掩盖了雄心壮志。<br><br>列维的典型主体是知识分子、研究男性暴君的历史学家、诗人、人类学博士生。这些人物是 21 世纪的赫尔佐格，他们情不自禁地通过智力固着的棱镜来表达自己的神经症。在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/hot-milk-deborah-levy/9781620406700?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>《热牛奶》</i></a>中，人类学家与母亲的关系是一种不断翻转的亲缘结构。在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-man-who-saw-everything-deborah-levy/9781632869852?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>《洞察一切的人》</i></a>中，这位历史学家指出，斯大林会通过向女性扔面包来调情——我们了解到他暴虐的父亲也有这种扔碳水化合物的习惯。这些学术重叠是她书中的乐趣之一。<br><br>艾尔莎符合利维的原型。她是一位神童，6 岁时被养父母从养父母身边挑选出来，以便一位伟大的老师亚瑟·戈德斯坦 (Arthur Goldstein) 将她培养成一名艺术大师。他是艾尔莎笔下的同性恋、浮夸迂腐的亨利·希金斯，训练她摆脱平凡的思维，以便她能够掌握古典曲目。<br><br>但当这本书开始时，艾莎正在雅典的市场里翻找，她刚刚羞辱性地跌跌撞撞地偏离了戈德斯坦所规划的伟大之路。当她在维也纳金色大厅演奏拉赫玛尼诺夫的第二钢琴协奏曲时，她开始下意识地演奏自己的不和谐音符，她最终意识到这是她自己创作冲动的表现，然后走下舞台，而大师轻蔑地嘲笑她。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/10/deborah-levy-man-who-saw-everything-review/599677/">阅读：黛博拉·利维令人迷惑却引人入胜的小说</a><br><br>一场身份危机开始于音乐会前夕，当时艾莎将头发染成蓝色，她将这一事件描述为与抛弃她的生母断绝了关系，最终使她变得虚弱。和利维笔下的许多其他主角一样，她发现自己在欧洲旅游胜地南部的各个地方穿梭，在阳光普照的蜿蜒旅程中寻求治愈。<br><br>利维的小说有一种不可否认的、也是不可否认的、令人着迷的怪异之处。引入分身是一种典型的非典型举动。利维并不完全实践魔幻现实主义；她的书与生活的实际情况联系得太紧密，不可能这样描述。但她的情节以奇怪的时刻和滑稽的误解为基础——如果不是魔法，确切地说，那么机缘巧合似乎融入了她的虚构世界。小细节被赋予了象征意义；单词和短语的重复具有模糊的目的。<br><br>但利维的替身的存在是她小说中最明显的故意想法之一。这是她的女权主义的核心，政治承诺巧妙地渗透到她的小说中，并不太微妙地塑造了她的非小说类作品。她用它来理解自己生活中的挣扎。这个分身不仅跟踪利维的主角，而且还跟踪他。它贯穿了她的全部工作。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">在美国，</span>人们对利维的喜爱很大程度上取决于她精彩的回忆录三部曲——她称之为“活生生的自传”——其中包括一本薄薄的卷子<i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/things-i-don-t-want-to-know-on-writing-deborah-levy/9781635572247?affiliate_id=atl-347">《我不想知道的事情》</a> 。</i>这本书是对乔治·奥威尔著名文章《我为何写作》的女权主义回应。利维采纳了奥威尔所说的“写作的四大动机”，并将其用作她的章节标题，尽管她的论点的实质内容是隐晦的，而奥威尔的则不然。让奥威尔作为她的陪衬并不是一种激进的反传统姿态。相反，她利用这个模板来解释自己，表明推动女作家的冲动与感动奥威尔的冲动有多么不同。<br><br>把自己的回忆录附在奥威尔身上似乎有点鲁莽，因为这位散文家的传记是独立写作生活的浪漫定义，在顽强地追求正义事业中回避物质荣耀。但有一个相似之处并不让人感到紧张：利维在她职业生涯的大部分时间里也遭受了严重的忽视。 50 岁出头时，她无法为自己的小说<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/swimming-home-deborah-levy/9781620401699?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>《游泳之家》</i></a>找到主要出版商，因此她在英国政府和读者订阅的支持下，通过一家小型非营利出版社出版了该书。<br><br> <i>《游泳回家》</i>是她 15 年来的第一部小说，这种中年成功的情况很少见。这让评论家大吃一惊，并让她连续三年入围布克奖决赛。考虑到她的自传中包含的故事——一系列的个人危机和对真实自我的长期搜救任务，利维的繁荣来得迟来并不令人意外。<br><br> 5岁时，南非警察的一个特别部门半夜从家里的平房里抓走了她的父亲，一位学者和活动家。他最终与他在非洲人国民大会上的战友纳尔逊·曼德拉一起接受审判。在她父亲入狱期间，利维的母亲将她送到德班的教母那里，在那里她在一所天主教学校上学，并生活在严厉的族长的屋顶下。<br><br>当种族隔离政府释放了她 9 岁的父亲时，全家前往英国寻求庇护，但流亡加剧了她日益增长的疏离感，因为她试图融入 20 世纪 70 年代英国沉闷的生活。利维通过将自己重塑为一个青少年波西米亚人来应对这种混乱，尽管她坐在工人阶级油腻的勺子里，没有一丝巴黎精致的感觉。 “我是一个悲伤的女孩，模仿着一个悲伤的女孩，”她回忆道。<br><br>她的疏离感一直伴随着她进入成年期——当母亲意味着她要以牺牲自己的幸福和艺术成就为代价来照顾家人：“在家里没有宾至如归的感觉是社会及其更大故事的开始。女性的不满。”<br><br>利维最终选择了分身的想法，这是对她个人的骚乱历史和挥之不去的不真实感的回应，这是可以理解的。如此频繁地偏离预期路线，不可避免地会着迷于菲利普·罗斯曾经描述的“反生活”，即存在的另一种版本，如果存在的话<i>会怎样？</i><i> </i>完全呈现在想象中。在她的回忆录中，她想象自己遇到了自己的替身——离婚后，她年轻的移民自我在中年拜访她，当时她坐在伦敦北部的公寓楼里观看<i>英国烘焙大赛</i>。<br><br>双重人格的想法切入了她女权主义的本质：母亲们被她们在孩子出生之前的生活以及她们对家庭做出的让步所困扰。解放是恢复不受社会束缚的另类自我。这是“学习如何成为一个主体，而不是一个错觉”。<br><br>利维小说的令人兴奋之处在于，它们充满了这种不懈的探索精神。抄袭奥威尔的论文格式是她顽皮的实验主义的象征。她最好的小说都带有结构性风险。 <i>《目睹一切的人》</i>分为两部分，相隔 28 年，每一部分都重复着同一个不太可能的时刻：书中的中心人物走进艾比路的人行横道，然后被一名德国男子驾驶的汽车撞倒。这是对著名形象和巧妙构思的致敬。事故的报复让她重新回顾了本书前半部分的事件。随着时间的推移，叙述者对其人际关系的自恋误读被暴露出来。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/jenny-erpenbeck-german-writer-kairos-memoir-book/673789/">阅读：在废墟中书写</a><br><br>利维的作品集就像弗洛伊德的符号和短语宇宙，这些符号和短语反复出现在她的书中以及她的书中。她描述了有人错误地引用了<i>《共产党宣言》</i>中关于幽灵出没欧洲的著名台词——然后<i>幽灵</i>这个词开始困扰小说本身，每次出现都会激怒读者，迫使读者更深入地思考它的含义。<br><br>她使用相同措辞提出的某些问题逐字出现在不同的书中。在她的一本回忆录中，她问道：“我们如何处理那些我们不想知道的事情？”这个问题启发了这本书的书名——它再次出现在<i>《八月的蓝色》中。</i>这个问题会让那些被反生活折磨的人困扰。<br><br> <i>《<span class="smallcaps">令人敬畏的蓝色》</span></i><span class="smallcaps">有其自己</span>的发明，但与利维最近的书无关。最后，艾莎坐在她的老师兼代理父亲戈德斯坦身边，看着他躺在撒丁岛的一座小房子里，垂死挣扎。他有点欺负人，但却是她生命中唯一的感情来源，无论这取决于她的艺术成功。<br><br>她确实过着戈德斯坦为她选择的生活。他把她的名字从安改为艾尔莎，并规划了她的职业生涯，部分原因是为了证明自己作为一名教师的天才。只有在他即将死亡的阴影下，艾莎才抛开恐惧和怨恨，去了解她亲生父母的身份。最后，这是我们在电影院里一遍又一遍看到的典型情节：一个被收养的孩子面对她对自我认知的可怕渴望。<br><br>更重要的是，利维对古典音乐世界的女权主义批评一反常态地崎岖不平。她过度渲染了一个女人被迫掌握男性天才的分数同时压制自己的创造力的主题。艾莎在空闲时间观看舞者伊莎多拉·邓肯 (Isadora Duncan) 的 YouTube 视频，羡慕她的艺术自由，这种全神贯注与艾莎被剧目束缚的感觉形成了一种解放性的对比，这有点过于粗暴了。<br><br>然而，即使在这部不太完全实现的小说中——她最好的作品是<i>《看见一切的男人》</i>和<i>《热牛奶</i>》——利维也展示了她独特的思想。如果说女权主义的最终目标，正如她所宣扬的那样，是要夺回个性，消除一个人更充实、更真实的自我的阴影，那么她的散文就体现了这一想法。她的语言非常优美，是她自己的：她将自杀念头的娱乐性描述为“站在禁忌的牧场上”；她称艾莎染过的鬃毛是“非常有表现力的头发”。她的图像是辛辣的原创。她在一次潜水旅行中让艾莎毫不畏惧地用叉子刺伤海胆，向我们展示了艾莎的残忍能力。<br><br>利维的研究对象都是可信的知识分子，因为她也是。当她不经意地在对话中插入一段关于尼采失败的音乐实验的即兴片段时，它是有机而有趣的。她对弗洛伊德的解读从来都隐藏在她散文的表面之下——她如此频繁地重复弗洛伊德的短语“我们不想知道的事情”，这几乎是一个弗洛伊德式的笑话。作为一名观察者，她能够回忆起刚刚过去的历史性时刻，以令人不安的精确度描述了大流行病的倦怠，捕捉到了隔离后日常人际互动的尴尬。<br><br>由于她的女权主义和她的古怪行为，利维往往会被批评家挤到一个特定的位置，而这种方式无法体现她书中的雄心壮志。英国<i>《金融时报》</i>最近称她为“邪教小说家”。但这感觉很吝啬。相反，我们应该按照她的本来面目来称呼她：当今工作中最活跃、最令人满意的思想小说家之一。<br><br></div>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110735295720085796">今天早上发表声明</a>称，他周日晚上收到了司法部特别顾问杰克·史密斯的一封“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/jm/criminal-resource-manual-160-sample-target-letter">目标信</a>”。他说史密斯给了他四天的时间向大陪审团报告，调查特朗普试图颠覆 2020 年大选和 2021 年 1 月 6 日国会大厦骚乱。此类信件通常是起诉书的前奏。<br><br><a

<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/07/18/us/trump-jan-6-letter#trump-jan-6-letter">一些</a>媒体已经从其他消息<a data-event-element="inline link"

日相关的罪行，那么这仍然留下了很大的疑问。其中最重要的是这些可能是什么犯罪。传闻中的可能性包括<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2023/04/12/trump-fundraising-fraud-special-counsel/">筹款违规</a>、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/us/politics/jan-6-prosecutors-trump-fund-raising.html">电汇欺诈</a>等检方惯用手段，甚至叛乱——这是一种极其罕见的指控，但众议院调查委员会 1 月 6 日将一项指控<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/january-6-committee-criminal-referral-donald-trump/672514/">提交</a>给了司法部。<br><br>史密斯可以选择对<a

（史密斯上个月在该案中起诉了特朗普。）在曼哈顿，这位前总统面临的指控主要是向一名自称与他发生性关系的成人电影演员支付封口费。人们普遍预计佐治亚州富尔顿县地方检察官将在 8 月的某个时候提出与 2020 年选举相关的指控。<br><br>这些案件可以沿着两个轴绘制：定罪概率和犯罪严重性。犯罪就是犯罪，但曼哈顿案相对来说是小事，一些法律观察家认为检方的法律理论值得怀疑。文件案不仅非常严重——它涉及一些对国家安全最敏感的材料——而且事实相对简单，对特朗普来说也是毁灭性的。富尔顿县案件很严重，因为它涉及颠覆选举的企图，但也仅限于佐治亚州的行动；降低定罪的可能性具有挑战性。<br><br>但与 1 月 6 日相关的潜在联邦案件可能是最重要的案件。这些罪行再严重不过了：特朗普首先通过法律和政治计划，然后更绝望地通过武力来挫败选民的意愿。从来没有哪位总统如此直接地攻击美国民主的基础。相比之下，即使是尼克松的罪行也显得黯然失色。<br><br> <a

1 月 6 日煽动骚乱。他的行为非常恶劣，以至于众议院对他进行了弹劾，大多数参议员，包括一些共和党人，投票判定有罪——尽管仍低于定罪所需的三分之二。<br><br>然而，有些事情可能用普通话来说是明显正确的，但仍然具有挑战性或无法向陪审团证明。 “你和我都知道，这不是秘密，但在法庭上，在有争议的听证会上，用可接受的证据，排除合理怀疑来证明这一点要困难得多，”前联邦检察官保罗·罗森茨威格(Paul Rosenzweig)早些时候告诉我今年。二月，特朗普发布了一份备忘录<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/trump-january-6-possible-indictment-defense-jack-smith/673070/">，列出了他可能对与骚乱相关的任何指控进行辩护的理由</a>。在今天的声明中，他将针对他的案件描述为“选举干涉”，这是<a

年来最大规模的无家可归者代表性调查。它包含来自加州 3,200 名无家可归者的调查数据以及对其中 300 多名无家可归者的深入采访。<br><br>接受调查的无家可归者绝大多数是当地人，而不是来自远方的移民：90% 的人失去了在加利福尼亚州的最后一个住房，75% 的人在他们经历无家可归的同一县失去了它。在 10% 来自其他地方的人中，30% 出生在加利福尼亚州。其他大多数人都有家庭或雇佣关系，或者以前曾在该州居住过。<br><br>退一步来说，数以万计的人在无家可归后搬到加州的想法毫无意义。搬家很贵。失去住房的人很少有办法在全国范围内运送自己、家人、宠物和财物。抛开这一点不谈，无家可归使人们变得脆弱。第一本能不是搬到新的地方，而是留在家人和朋友网络以及潜在的工作机会附近。<br><br>研究人员小心翼翼地确定受访者的来源，但没有促使他们给出任何一个答案。 “我们没有说，‘嘿，你来自加利福尼亚州吗？’”该研究的首席研究员、贝尼奥夫无家可归者和住房计划主任玛戈特·库谢尔告诉我。她说，受访者被要求回顾他们的生活史，解释导致他们无家可归的情况。在此过程中，他们被要求澄清关键的地理细节。<br><br>例如，这是她与我分享的一次交流：<br><br><p>采访者：那你当时（第一次失去住房）几岁？</p><p>回答者：我33岁了。</p><p>采访者：三十三，好吧。那是在这儿，还是在哪儿？</p><p>受访者：那实际上是在加利福尼亚州的波莫纳。</p><p>采访者：波莫纳，好的。然后你一直呆在那里吗？你无家可归之后发生了什么？你的转变是什么？</p><p>受访者：嗯，我有点跳来跳去，但在地理位置上并不是很多。我有点摇摆不定，只是因为，就像我说的，我根本不知道如何应对无家可归的情况。我以前从未无家可归过。我感觉不舒服。我正在努力寻找睡觉的地方。每次他们把你赶走时，你都会说：“好吧，我不能睡在那里，所以我就去这里吧。”所以，事情就是这样发生的。我最终来到了一个叫克莱蒙特的城市……还有另一个克莱蒙特实际上就在波莫纳附近。这就是我住的地方，在波莫纳和克莱蒙特、安大略省、奇科等地区之间来回穿梭。它的地理面积不是很大，但技术上是不同的城市。</p>这是另一个：<br><br><p>采访者：您[无家可归]之前住在哪里？</p><p>受访者：加利福尼亚州圣贝纳迪诺。我妈妈的房子有五间卧室。她在那里住了50年零14天。</p><p>采访者：你妈妈的房子，好吧。你离开那所房子回到这里。</p><p>对方：就走开了。</p><p>记者：是因为她去世了吗？</p><p>受访者：不，因为我的家人很恶魔而且很可怕。我们应该哀悼她，而他们只是来看看能从房子里得到什么和其他东西。所以，我就离开了，因为事情不应该是这样的。我哥哥因为照顾我妈妈、殴打我等等而让我住院三次。我原谅他们；我想继续前进。无家可归只是一个停留；你给汽车充电，充电，然后重新上路。我生命中最美好的部分就是我生命的下一部分。就是这样。</p>这是另一个：<br><br><p>采访者：那你是怎么来到这里的？那么你在德克萨斯州；你有房子。</p><p>回答者：我有房子。我得了癌症，肾癌。我失去了工作，失去了房子……</p><p>采访者：你在休斯顿做什么——什么样的工作？</p><p>受访者：我当了20年卡车司机。</p><p>采访者：那你是怎么来到加州的呢？</p><p>受访者：我来自加利福尼亚州。于是我就回到了家。</p>加利福尼亚州是大多数无家可归者的<em>家园</em>。最常报告的失去住房的原因是由于失业或工作时间减少而导致收入减少。其次是经济原因，其次是两个社会原因：居民之间的冲突，以及对室友或家庭成员施加压力的担忧。在一个更负担得起的环境中，这些社会原因只会导致地址的改变，而不是无家可归。<br><br>通过提前识别高危人群来防止无家可归是非常困难的。部分原因是，处于不稳定局势中的人们比真正失去家园的人们要大得多，而且正如报告所揭示的那样，当人们确实失去家园时，这种情况发生得非常快。签订租约的受访者平均提前 10 天收到他们将失去住房的通知。 60% 没有租约的人报告中位数只有一天。这并不是联系社会服务机构寻求帮助的宽限期。<br><br>然而库舍尔强调，一些无家可归的现象是可以预见的。许多人因监狱或看守所而变得无家可归——占受访者的 19%。更重要的是，67% 的受访者入狱时无家可归。然而，只有不到 20% 的人表示在退出时获得了福利、医疗保健或住房支持。库舍尔表示，阻止加州新一轮无家可归者的流动是“轻而易举的事”：“我们知道人们在哪里；我们知道他们会发生什么。”<br><br>一旦人们失去了家园，搬进新家就变得极具挑战性。受访者表示，距离上次拥有住房的时间中位数为 22 个月。近 90% 的受访者表示，住房成本影响了他们摆脱无家可归的能力。一位受访者表示：“我曾尝试自己寻找公寓，但我想确保自己能买得起。而他们中的大多数人，他们想要三倍的租金。仅就单间公寓或一间卧室而言，价格为 1,100 美元、1,200 美元，仅此而已。我说，‘哇’，你知道吗？这意味着我必须赚到 3,300 美元。我并没有这么做。而且我不会很快做到这一点。”<br><br>超过一半的受访者表示，他们<em>能</em>负担得起的住房距离工作或医疗保健太远，不安全，没有公共交通服务，或者距离孩子或家人太远。受访者还提到了住房歧视、在寻找合适的经济适用住房方面缺乏支持、住房等待时间长达数年、缺乏住房券以及药物滥用（包括在街上使用药物保持清醒和警惕）等障碍。<br><br>无家可归就像慢慢地从山上滚下来。在某人跌倒（或失去住房）后立即是提供帮助的最佳时机：在他们经历创伤和不稳定事件<em>之前</em>。在他们出现或恶化药物滥用问题<em>之前</em>。在他们用尽家人和朋友愿意提供的所有帮助<em>之前</em>。在他们上班迟到太多次，或者没有干净衣服上班<em>之前</em>。<br><br>但即使是一个运作良好、资金充足、及早干预的无家可归机构也无法结束无家可归危机，因为无家可归危机就是<em>家庭</em>危机。<br><br>对于即将从与大家庭共同居住的过度拥挤的公寓中被驱逐的人来说，房屋的中位价意味着什么？实际上很多。一条住房链连接着低收入住房、中等收入住房和高收入住房。当新的市场价格单位首次推出并且人们搬进其中时，这会释放他们以前居住的房屋（通常较旧）的空间。当新住房<em>没有</em>投放市场时，高收入居民就会转向旧住房，从而抬高价格。反过来，中等收入工人转向低收入住房单元，底层的每个人都挤在数量不断减少的经济适用房中，直到有人失去自己的位置。<br><br>加州和全国其他昂贵的州推迟建造更多住房的每一天，都会有一个未来的家庭流落街头。<br><br></div>

Threads，热情战胜了经验。<em>我确信，为一个不负责任的亿万富翁运营的社交媒体平台创建免费内容，这次会产生不同的结果</em>，我们告诉自己，就好像我们都是昨天出生的一样。<br><br>我们知道这个故事的结局。我们知道，Facebook 和 Twitter

等新平台仍在建设中，这意味着它们仍然会受到影响，社会的选择仍然是开放的。这些网站不必复制以前的内容，并且可以从过去的错误中吸取教训。较旧的平台依靠煽动性参与来提高短期利润，但这种选择最终从内部破坏了社交网络，疏远了用户和广告商。如今的平台可以通过旨在建立信任而不是削弱信任的新规则和功能来吸引下一代用户，从而确保网站的长期生存能力。<br><br>以下是我自己的一些建议。该清单并不详尽，理性的人无疑会不同意其中的一些建议。但我希望我们都能同意这次对话的必要性，以及在再次拥抱社交媒体之前重新思考我们想要从社交媒体中得到什么的必要性。<br><br>制定道路规则。<br><br>多年来，Facebook

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://reason.com/2023/01/02/under-government-pressure-twitter-suppressed-truthful-speech-about-covid-19/">一直在压制</a>一系列有关 COVID-19 的言论——有些是虚假的，有些只是有争议的<a

specifics of these determinations private, because they want to avoid opening themselves up to controversy. But making moderation a black box has invited a different form of controversy. Because users could never tell exactly why certain content was taken down or suppressed, the platforms became easy targets for suspicion, paranoia, and accusations of bias. It&#39;s true that no set of public-moderation principles will satisfy all comers. But that&#39;s a feature, not a bug. Users will be able to choose where to spend their time based on whether a platform aligns with their ideals, and platforms will no longer be plagued by users who are constantly aggrieved by their treatment.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/social-media-algorithms-twitter-meta-rss-reader/673282/">Yair Rosenberg: How to take back control of what you read on the internet</a><br><br> <strong>Embrace impermanence—and privacy.</strong><br><br> The difference between real-world conversation and social-media interaction is that the internet version lives forever, which makes it hard for individuals to grow beyond their past selves and dumbest remarks. Young people in particular can be prone to oversharing online, often expressing their age-appropriate ignorance and immaturity. Before the internet, this natural part of adolescence would fade into obscurity as a person entered adulthood. Today, however, that is no longer true, with perverse consequences—and not just for teenagers. In extreme cases, online-offense archaeologists mine people&#39;s profiles for problematic pronouncements they made years ago, regardless of whether these sentiments reflect who the person is now. This creates a culture of constant surveillance and suspicion, and risks <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/deep-shtetl/63399d48fb1fdd0036293c1e/yom-kippur-forgiveness-anti-semitism-antepli/">imprisoning promising people</a> in the worst versions of themselves, eternally tarred by their earliest errors.<br><br> To prevent these problems, platforms should archive old content by default and make it inaccessible to others after a set period, perhaps 30 days, that could be adjusted by the user. Old posts would remain readable to those who made them but unavailable to strangers and search engines. Social media could once again become a conversation, where comments are understood not as an individual&#39;s last word on a subject but rather as part of their ongoing evolution as a person. Although this policy may allow some prominent people to archive less savory parts of their past, that cost is outweighed by the benefits for everyday people who don&#39;t deserve to be reduced to their lowest moments.<br><br> <strong>End the trends.</strong><br><br> For the past week, “The Jews” have been trending on Twitter. This is not because people are admiring their <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-jewish-history-of-americas-most-famous-ice-creams/">outsize contribution</a> to the American ice-cream industry. It&#39;s because far-right accounts have been sharing anti-Semitic content. The public&#39;s prurient obsession with Jews predates social media, but regularly featuring it on a sidebar is a choice. Twitter&#39;s “Trending” section was intended to capture whatever users were discussing at the moment, but in practice, it often serves as an amplification of the platform&#39;s pathologies, directing users to viral pile-ons and artificially boosted scams.<br><br> These problems could be partly ameliorated through human moderation, but that requires manpower and cultural competency, and the decisions would constantly invite controversy. The only way to win this game is not to play, letting users talk about what they like without prodding them toward unrelated conversations or incentivizing trend-chasing content. Online activism would also be released from the bizarre grip of hashtag campaigns, which have enticed organizations with their visibility but not necessarily their payoff.<br><br> <strong>Ban world leaders—or at least those who ban their own people from social media.</strong><br><br> Whether it&#39;s Trump inciting a riot at the Capitol or the Supreme Leader of Iran <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/446928689943420928?lang=fi">denying</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/1321494146989907969">the Holocaust</a> while <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1534560786462416897">inciting</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Yair_Rosenberg/status/1552450234210459650">anti-Semitism</a> , heads of state have often presented the biggest headache for social-media platforms. Because these people&#39;s pronouncements are inherently newsworthy, moderating even their most extreme statements presents a problem, no matter how perilous the potential consequences of their words. As the Trump example demonstrates, case-by-case decisions about political leaders are charged and controversial, and inevitably blow back on the platform. The solution is not to let them on the site in the first place. It&#39;s not as though these politicians lack other options for getting their message out. What&#39;s more, keeping them off social media would also have the salutary effect of encouraging them to work for their actual constituents rather than perform for an amorphous online audience. You can post or be president—but not both.<br><br> <a href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/deep-shtetl/62a11ef0582ffb002082bd49/iran-ayatollah-ali-khamenei-twitter-anti-semitism/">Yair Rosenberg: Why Twitter won&#39;t ban its most powerful anti-Semite</a><br><br> A less ambitious alternative: If a country restricts a social-media site for its citizens, its political leaders and diplomats should be banned from the platform. At present, authoritarian regimes in China and Iran block Facebook and Twitter for their population while permitting their own apparatchiks to use the platforms to push propaganda. In practice, this means that dictatorships are able to speak over their own people on social media, facing minimal opposition. Going forward, platforms should instead hold a country&#39;s officials to the same standard those officials impose on the people they repress.<br><br> Social media<span class="smallcaps"> </span>was foisted on our society without any deliberation over its implications. It&#39;s had many positive consequences, elevating previously unheard voices and exposing injustice. But it has also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">coarsened</a> our collective discourse, dumbed down our discussions of complex issues, and cultivated a culture of conspiracism and constant controversy. Many of these failings are human failings, but the structure of the first wave of social-media sites <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-problems-misinformation-bigotry/671952/">intensified and rewarded</a> them.<br><br> Ultimately, these very failures caused the platforms to degrade, which means that it is in the best interest of the next generation of social-media companies to alleviate them. When these sites first debuted, their proprietors had no idea that they would be wrangling presidents and pandemics. Now they do—and it&#39;s time their infrastructure was rebuilt with the lessons of the past couple of decades in mind.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 18 Jul 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/twitter-threads-new-suggested-rules/674709/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/twitter-threads-new-suggested-rules/674709/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[In Praise of Phone Numbers]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The internet offers many new ways to communicate, but nothing eclipses the 10-digit phone number. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/a52YFmgtdZ3O1Ip79Zxz6dKtA6E=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/phone_numbers/original.png" alt="一只手拿着手机" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Paul Spella / The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> Imagine for a moment a technology that is simple and universal, and needs no software updates. It is a string of numbers, each portion acting as a precise set of coordinates—so basic and elegant that your great-grandparents could use it. Put the numbers in the correct sequence and the technology immediately triggers a bit of magic: Where seconds ago there was silence and haptic nothingness, all of a sudden there is a glorious burst of sound or vibration miles, even continents, away. Then, if you&#39;re lucky, you hear a voice, and you respond with yours: your questions, your frustrated pleas to speak with a “representative!”<br><br> The phone number has been with us in some form since 1879, and unlike carbon paper, VHS tapes, and the Walkman, it is not yet obsolete. Although there are dozens of ways to get in touch now, few are as durable and reliable as picking up the phone. A quick thought experiment: Say you just got in a fender bender or, God forbid, find yourself in a genuine emergency—would you text for help, or would you dial an emergency contact or 911? Although so much of our identities have migrated online, these sequences of numerals are an analog tie to the physical world. When we make an account or need to prove our identity to any given system of machines and networks, we use the string of numbers as a means of authentication.<br><br> But the phone number isn&#39;t just the yeoman farmer of the technological landscape—a modest, utilitarian workhorse—it is also a vital cultural touchstone. I am and have always been a man without a county; a person who, because of childhood relocations and general adult restlessness, has had the great fortune to adopt many a hometown, from Manhattan to Missoula, Montana. Despite my wandering, my sense of place and a nontrivial aspect of my identity is forever fixed, thanks to three simple numbers: <em>610</em> , which is switchboard speak for the “Philadelphia Suburb Zone <em>.</em> ” I lived there for only a decade, but it was when I happened to get my first cellphone. My area code thus provides me with something akin to a clever disguise or even a passport. Stumbling upon another 610 number is like opening a door. <em>What town are you from? Oh really, where&#39;d you go to school?</em> Three digits can turn a stranger into a fellow traveler.<br><br> Phone numbers, they&#39;re wonderful! A great invention, 10 out of 10, no notes! <em>Call JG Wentworth! 877-CASH-NOW! 800-588-2300, EMPIRE (today)!</em> Where would we be without phone numbers? Bored? Lost? Wearing a loincloth and grilling freshly hunted meat over an open flame? I can&#39;t help but feel a little romantic about the fact that, one day in 2003, I stumbled out of a Hot Topic and into a Cingular Wireless store at the King of Prussia mall and emerged with a mostly random 10-digit signifier that I still use to log in to my bank, contact the vet, and text <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/realteaemoji/status/1679173275002322972?s=20">upsetting, AI-generated TikToks</a> to my group chat at 1 am That&#39;s staying power <em>and</em> versatility.<br><br> After I <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/cwarzel/status/1641161893904793600">tweeted</a> about the role phone numbers play in our lives, a number of people responded to share their own perspectives. A phone number can mark a new occasion, as it did for a user named Austin McKinley, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/thebadcode/status/1641514561009483776?s=20">told</a> me that the first thing he did in 2008 when he moved to San Francisco was buy an iPhone and get a local phone number. “Old life over, new life started,” he wrote. In places such as Maine (and my former Montana), an area code can mean state pride. “Having a non-207 number is an immediate signal of outsiderness,” Twitter user Ben Sprague, a Mainer, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/bensprague/status/1641167129645809664?s=20">told</a> me. “Woe to those from away suffering the slings and arrows of area-code discrimination.” A good number can also be a sentimental tie to the past, as it is for a user located in Philadelphia who goes by Amy, and who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/theHollandaise/status/1641164293746958336?s=20">told</a> me that she inherited her number from her mother when she died. And my friend John, who tweets as Johnny Courage, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/johnnycourage/status/1641296385361301504?s=20">holds</a> on to his 919 area code in order to “keep my Carolina bona fides and Southern expat status strong,” he wrote. “It&#39;s a quaint relic of yesterday, sure. But it connects me to home.”<br><br> These old-fashioned pleasures shouldn&#39;t suggest that the phone number hasn&#39;t evolved over time. As my colleague Megan Garber <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/our-numbered-days-the-evolution-of-the-area-code/283803/">wrote in 2014</a> , phone numbers started out as peculiar alphanumeric addresses that served small geographic areas (for instance, MU 5-9975, she wrote, would direct you to a switchboard agent who would then connect you with a line in the Murray Hill neighborhood of New York City). As phones grew more popular, the manual-switchboard system became automated and the number system went from regional to national, with a longer set of numbers and the introduction of area codes. Each time the numbering system has expanded, we&#39;ve grumbled about it, but still, it persists—North America&#39;s current 10-digit numbering system <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/23/technology/the-10-or-11-digit-local-call-fosters-anxiety-and-shrugs.html">launched</a> in Maryland in 1997, and we haven&#39;t looked back.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/02/our-numbered-days-the-evolution-of-the-area-code/283803/">Read: The evolution of the area code</a><br><br> But even the 10-digit system—one of the technological constants of my life—has an expiration date. At some point, the numbers will run out, a realization that caused me to wonder who, if anyone, is keeping tabs on our numbers. Thankfully, the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalnanpa.com/about_us/index.html">North American Numbering Plan Administrator</a> , the delightfully bureaucratic organization that manages and assigns phone numbers and area codes in 20 countries, is on the case. Say a whole bunch of people move to Montana or Maine and request new numbers—NANPA&#39;s team works with carriers and state commissions to roll out a new area code, a process that takes at least three years, Florence Weber, NANPA&#39;s senior director, told me.<br><br> “We continue to see an uptick in terms of requests for numbers—that&#39;s not going away,” Weber said. But nothing lasts forever. NANPA has been closely monitoring and preparing for the day that we run out of three-digit area codes or have to move beyond the 10-digit number. Weber told me that, according to NANPA&#39;s proprietary prediction system, which takes into account forecasted demands and assignment rates, the “projected exhaustion date” is sometime in 2051.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1880/06/a-telephonic-conversation/306078/">Mark Twain: A telephonic conversation (from June 1880)</a><br><br> I shudder to think what will happen on that day. The dawn of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/are-12-digit-phone-numbers-in-our-future/">longer phone numbers</a> is one possibility; surrendering to online services is another. The phone number feels a bit like a relic in the age of Zoom meetings, one-tap FaceTiming, WhatsApp, Signal, Viber, DMs, Discord—you name it. Phone numbers were originally conceived as a way to route connections via location, and technically speaking, the internet now does this just as well either via IP addresses or by using the Voice over Internet Protocol. The nerds <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pocketnow.com/why-are-we-still-using-phone-numbers/">suggest</a> that we could ditch the numbering system and use a decentralized calling system that works a bit like web addresses do—you get a unique address and purchase a domain, so people can contact you without having to punch in a long string of numbers.<br><br> Still, it&#39;s worth considering what we lose if our area codes, prefixes, and line numbers are slowly washed away by the sands of time. If nothing more, it&#39;s worth appreciating these digits—an impersonal series of semi-random numbers that, once they&#39;re yours, take on a new life.

A featureless one-story brick warehouse with some makeshift offices attached, it has just enough space for the tiny handful of election-commission employees, the 275 voting machines that they recently purchased, and maybe some of the maintenance workers who used to share rooms with them, back when the agency was still in the basement of the county-administration building.<br><br> Dusty picnic tables crowd against the wall. An elementary school stands a few hundred yards away. Nothing about this building or its location screams “controversy.” But when Sumner County&#39;s local elections brought a faction that calls itself the Constitutional Republicans to power last year, that is what it nevertheless became.<br><br> To fully grasp this story, you need to understand that the standard forms of American political polarization don&#39;t exist in Sumner, a rural but rapidly suburbanizing county where Democrats are not part of the equation at all. None has won any county office for more than two decades. Instead, the main opponents of the Constitutional Republicans, who won 14 out of 17 seats on the county commission (following a general election in which only 15 percent of eligible voters cast ballots), are the ordinary Republicans—or, as their opponents would call them, RINOs (“Republicans in name only”). The Constitutional Republicans&#39; website explains that RINOs are different from themselves: “They raise taxes, they vote to silence the citizens, they won&#39;t protect private property rights. They often partner with Democrats to defeat true Constitutional Republicans like us.”<br><br> Upon taking over the county commission, the Constitutional Republicans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/election-conspiracies-local-government-religion-republicans-tennessee-758307fb4856c91138c085ad70505841">issued a document</a> formally declaring that their activities will be “reflective of Judeo-Christian values inherent in the nation&#39;s founding.” They also shut down the HR department, tried to privatize a public historic building, and refused to pay for the election commission&#39;s move to the brick building, although it had been agreed on by the previous administration. The old offices—three basement rooms that recently flooded—were too small to store the new voting machines, and also insecure. The entrance to the basement stood right beside a cashier&#39;s window where dozens of people were lined up to pay taxes on the day I visited. The county commissioners are unmoved by those arguments. “If we don&#39;t fund it, you don&#39;t get to do it,” Jeremy Mansfield, one of the Constitutional Republicans on the county commission, told the election commission at one public meeting about the move last fall. At a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BYzcIZXfkmI">meeting in June</a> , another county commissioner, angered because the new voting machines had been delivered to the new building, said that although he would “hate to pull the ace card,” the commission could always “declare this property surplus, and sell it.” That would leave the election commission, and its machines, with nowhere to go.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/trump-induced-idiocy-tennessee/673726/">Peter Wehner: An acute attack of Trumpism in Tennessee</a><br><br> The building seems a small thing to get worked up about. But Facebook posts and videos of public meetings, all available online—the Constitutional Republicans are very transparent—make clear that this is not a trivial jurisdictional dispute and these are not petty people. They have ambitions and interests that extend well beyond their county. Their Facebook page reacted to the news of Donald Trump&#39;s latest indictment by declaring, “The Biden family is an organized crime family,” and “Our justice system is rigged against Trump.” Another post asked whether Tennessee “should secede from the Union.” More to the point, Mansfield, who didn&#39;t respond to my request for an interview (his view of the press is clear on his Facebook page, on which someone refers to the Associated Press as “American Pravda” and he responds “except that Pravda does more honest reporting”), wrote a long post back in February attacking early voting and voting machines: “The gold standard for election integrity would be paper ballots filled out by people and counted by people in local precincts on election day.”<br><br> The Constitutional Republicans are confident in these views for a reason. “Our beliefs are derived from the bible,” their website declares: “We pray at every meeting and we seek God in all we do! His wisdom guides our decisions.” The same source gives them confidence that their enemies are wrong. “Evil never sleeps,” Mansfield wrote on Facebook, after reflecting on the critics who he said were attacking him for fighting against new development in the county, “so we must heed Churchill&#39;s words, never give in, and never give up fighting for what is good and right.”<br><br> Few of these ambitious goals are within their reach. The Sumner County commissioners can&#39;t arrest President Joe Biden. They can&#39;t secede. But the county&#39;s election commission, whose members are appointed by the bipartisan state election commission, is right there. It&#39;s a local embodiment of the broader culture they dislike and of the government they distrust. If they can stick the agency back in the flood-prone basement, they will.<br><br> Tom Lee, the lawyer for the Sumner election commission—it is now suing the county—has an additional explanation as well. Lee points out that the Constitutional Republicans arrived in office wanting to enact deep, revolutionary change. That means that, whatever the previous regime decided, they are against it: “They are coming to power and saying, &#39;Everything that came before us doesn&#39;t count. We represent something new and different, and we don&#39;t have to have any allegiance to the past.&#39;” I told him that this sounded like the language used by the Bolsheviks, among other revolutionaries. He didn&#39;t laugh.<br><br> M <span class="smallcaps">ost of the time</span> , Tennessee politics doesn&#39;t make national news. That changed in April, when the leaders of the Republican supermajority in the Tennessee House of Representatives expelled two Democratic legislators, Justin Jones and Justin Pearson. The two men were accused of disrupting proceedings, because they repeated the demands of gun-control activists on the floor of the chamber, during a recess, using a megaphone.<br><br> The incident created a wave of outrage. The punishment seemed both extreme—since Reconstruction, only two people have been expelled from the Tennessee legislature, one for bribery and the other for alleged sexual misconduct—and racist, because it deliberately targeted two young Black men. A third protester, Representative Gloria Johnson, who is white, was allowed to keep her house seat. Belatedly, the Republicans who made this decision realized that it looked bad. At an acrimonious meeting held afterward (a tape of which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tnholler.com/2023/04/leaked-audio-tn-house-gop-caucus-infighting-over-tn-3-votes/">leaked to <i>The</i> <i>Tennessee Holler</i></a> , a local online publication), they expressed no regret at the expulsions, but they did berate one of the members for not voting to expel Johnson, on the grounds that leaving her out made them all seem like racists. The decision also made heroes of the protesters, now dubbed the Tennessee Three, a title previously bestowed on Johnny Cash&#39;s backup band. Jones and Pearson were reinstated by local officials, pending special elections in August, and became instant national stars.<br><br> But in truth, their story did not start on that day. Not so long ago, Tennessee was not merely a more bipartisan state but a <i>model</i> of bipartisanship, an example to others. Keel Hunt, a columnist for the <i>Tennessean</i> newspaper (and a Democrat who once worked for a Republican governor, Lamar Alexander), wrote a book about the 1980s and &#39;90s, an era when moderate Democrats and liberal Republicans ruled the state; when Tennessee sent Alexander, Howard Baker, Al Gore, and Jim Sasser to the US Senate; and when many of the decisions that paved the way for Tennessee&#39;s current investment boom were made. The book is called <i>Crossing the Aisle: How Bipartisanship Brought Tennessee to the Twenty-First Century and Could Save America</i> . So much has changed since then, Hunt told me, that the book “might now qualify as an obituary.”<br><br> Today, Tennessee is a model of one-party rule. It has a Republican governor and legislature. Republican appointees run the state supreme court. The state&#39;s nine-member US House delegation contains eight Republicans; Tennessee has sent two Republicans to the Senate. The governor is the only other official elected statewide. Unlike in other states, the attorney general and secretary of state in Tennessee are appointed, and they are both Republicans too.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/america-democracy-autocracy-laboratories/673751/">Brian Klaas: The red states experimenting with authoritarianism</a><br><br> Nor will the situation be easy to change, because gerrymandering is something of a blood sport in the state. The still-blue city of Nashville had a single Democrat representing it in Congress, but when the map was redrawn before the 2022 elections, GOP lawmakers split Nashville into three districts that stretch out into the countryside. Each elected a Republican. Instead of Jim Cooper, a Blue Dog moderate Democrat who held the seat for two decades, Nashville is now represented by, among others, Andy Ogles, who is best known for sending out a holiday card featuring himself, his children, and his wife all holding guns in front of a Christmas tree. State-level gerrymandering is just as vicious—Johnson reckons that one redistricting included a special effort to eliminate her from politics: “They split my precinct and drew a line basically a few blocks around my house to draw me out of the district,” she told me. (She moved, ran again, and won.)<br><br> Getting people to vote is not so easy, either, because Tennessee has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://stateline.org/2019/08/14/tennessee-made-it-harder-to-register-voters-activists-consider-whats-next/">some of the nation&#39;s most restrictive voting laws</a> . You can&#39;t register to vote any later than 30 days before the election. If you vote by absentee ballot, it has to arrive by mail on or before Election Day. There are no drop boxes. First-time voters have to vote in person, which is a special problem for college students studying out of state. In 2019, the legislature passed a law <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://stateline.org/2019/08/14/tennessee-made-it-harder-to-register-voters-activists-consider-whats-next/">subjecting voter-registration campaigners</a> to financial or criminal penalties if they submit too many erroneous forms—a provision that seemed designed to discourage get-out-the-vote campaigns, was blocked as unconstitutional, and later repealed. Perhaps none of these rules alone would seem outrageous. But the “cumulative effect,” argues Tricia Herzfeld, a Democrat who serves on Nashville&#39;s election commission, “is to make it hard to vote.” There is evidence for that theory: Tennessee has either one of the lowest or else the very lowest voter-turnout rates in the country, depending on how you count. And that, of course, is even before Sumner County moved to deprive its election commission of office space, conceivably making it difficult for anyone there to vote at all.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">came to Tennessee</span> partly because I wondered how similar it might feel to Poland and Hungary, where for the past decade I&#39;ve been warily observing the decline of democracy and the rise of the one-party state. The very large differences are immediately clear in Nashville, where music is the backdrop to everything, where everyone seems to be coming from a party or heading to one, where people on both sides of the political spectrum went out of their way to introduce me to other people. “This is a son-in-law kind of town,” someone told me. I wasn&#39;t quite sure what that meant (something to do with everyone looking after friends and relatives?), but it was amusing. For that and many other reasons, Nashville is not Budapest-on-the-Cumberland. The Bill of Rights still applies. Federal judges rule on Tennessee laws. The US Constitution is widely and even ostentatiously revered. There is no Central European gloom.<br><br> Nevertheless, the cascade of tiny legal and procedural changes designed to create an unlevel playing field, the ruling party&#39;s inexplicable sense of grievance, the displaced moderates with nowhere to go—this did seem familiar from other places. So was the sense that institutional politics has become performative, somehow separated from real life. The Tennessee Three staged their protest on the floor of the legislature, after all, because the conversation unfolding there had taken no notice of the much larger protests happening outside the chamber. A few days earlier, a horrific mass shooting at Covenant, a private Christian school in Nashville, had galvanized the public. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.vanderbilt.edu/2023/05/03/vanderbilt-poll-tennessee/">Opinion polls</a> showed that more than 70 percent of Tennesseans want red-flag laws that would allow officials to remove guns from people who might misuse them, while more than 80 percent support background checks and other gun-safety laws.<br><br> Those enormous majorities were not reflected in the legislative debate. In the days following the school shooting, it was just “business as usual,” Justin Kanew, the founder and editor of <i>The Tennessee Holler</i> , told me. Kanew, a transplant from California like a number of people in Nashville, is himself a former Democratic candidate for Congress in Tennessee. During his campaign, he saw a gap in the public conversation, and that experience led him to found the <i>Holler</i> . Or rather the Hollers: There are now several Twitter offshoots—the Chattanooga Holler, the Clarksville Holler, and so on—all focused on the hyperlocal issues that the statewide media were missing. Kanew&#39;s own talent is for a form of campaigning journalism: He produces short video clips, often of state legislators, and then circulates them on social media. Sometimes they go viral. That&#39;s what he was doing on the day the Tennessee Three made their protest. “There were thousands of people showing up at the capitol,” he told me, “asking for something to happen. And if nothing had happened, that would have been pretty deflating.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/04/tennessee-expulsions-republican-gop/673709/">Read: The Tennessee expulsions are just the beginning</a><br><br> This was not the first time that the Republican leadership sought to shut down debate. The house&#39;s “two Justins,” as they are now known, brought their megaphone precisely because the Republican leadership commonly turns off Democrats&#39; microphones when they are speaking. Representative Bo Mitchell was once cut off when he told the house, “Please don&#39;t say you are pro-life and put more weapons on the street”—a statement ruled to be insulting. Jones told me that he was ruled out of order during a committee meeting because he&#39;d said the leadership was “putting a Band-Aid on the issue” of school shootings; a few days later he was also told he had to remove a <span class="smallcaps">ban assault weapons</span> pin from his jacket. Republicans insist, as Tennessee House Majority Leader William Lamberth <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/NC5PhilWilliams/status/1661524250019201024?s=20">told a local television station</a> , that speakers are meant to stick to the topic: “It&#39;s not open-mic night.”<br><br> “They are coming to power and saying, &#39;Everything that came before us doesn&#39;t count. We represent something new and different, and we don&#39;t have to have any allegiance to the past.&#39;”<br><br> Under relatively recent rules, individual members&#39; question time has been cut from 15 minutes to five. Occasionally, people who want to raise objections are not called on at all. During a debate on a bill regulating abortion, Gloria Johnson told me, “I stood on the house floor for 45 minutes, the entire argument of the bill, and they refused to call on me.” These tactics are new. Johnson, who has served in the legislature on and off for more than a decade, told me that although the house also had a Republican supermajority when she joined in 2012, the speaker at that time didn&#39;t exclude Democrats from debate. “I don&#39;t recall her refusing to call on me,” she said. Jones, who was a community organizer in Nashville for a decade before being elected, agreed that previous speakers were more open to conversation. “This was the most extreme session I have ever seen,” he said. “Republicans now treat the legislature as a private palace, a fraternity house or a country club.”<br><br> Nor is radicalization visible only in the legislature. Just as Hungary&#39;s Viktor Orbán fights with opposition-controlled Budapest (and Turkey&#39;s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan fights with Istanbul, and Poland&#39;s Jarosław Kaczyński fights with Warsaw), so do Tennessee Republicans fight with opposition-controlled Nashville. Over breakfast at the Elliston Place Soda Shop—he likes showing off the city sites—Nashville Mayor John Cooper, a Democrat (and brother of Jim Cooper, the former member of Congress), ticked off the various disputes between the city and the state with a certain level of weariness: about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://eu.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2023/04/03/faa-intervenes-in-dispute-over-nashville-airport-leadership/70076289007/">control over the airport</a> , about the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.adamsandreese.com/last-call/fate-of-metro-nashville-beer-board-remains-uncertain-at-tennessee-general-assembly">beer board</a> , about the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://eu.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2023/03/09/bills-to-take-over-nashville-airport-sports-authority-boards-advance/69985037007/">sports authority</a> , about the size of the city council (Republicans tried to cut it from 40 members to 20), and about the 2024 Republican National Convention—which, partly thanks to all of the other quarrels, will not take place in Nashville.<br><br> Some of the disputes are just about who controls the money, but he thinks real cultural friction underlies those too. Whereas Nashville used to be what the mayor calls a “big county-seat kind of town,” famous for its music clubs, now it&#39;s also a focus of international investment, health-care investment, and tech investment. Oracle is building a $1 billion–plus campus in the city; Amazon has a major presence here too. On the morning we met, Mayor Cooper was jet-lagged, having just returned from Kurdistan. He went there because Nashville, aside from being the city that launched Taylor Swift, is also home to one of the largest Kurdish communities in America. After breakfast, he drove me to the East Bank, the site of the city&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nashville.gov/departments/planning/long-range-planning/local-planning-studies/east-bank-planning-study">next major development project</a> , one that will include a new stadium, new housing, and some infrastructure renovations; along the way, we passed a remarkable collection of building sites, replete with giant cranes. Still, in the conservative mediaverse, Nashville&#39;s city leaders are just another set of enemies. Fox News once devoted a whole segment to Cooper—in which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/virus-outbreak-marsha-blackburn-nashville-tucker-carlson-tennessee-d8370b1bab309d954a8b6b7fb5547d39">Tucker Carlson accused him, falsely</a> , of concealing information about COVID.<br><br> Kanew (and he isn&#39;t alone) thinks the state serves as a kind of “guinea pig,” a test market in this same mediaverse, a place where new culture-war themes can be experimentally stoked. A war on judges as well as on remote voting began in 2021, when the chair of a key house subcommittee <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/politics/2021/03/02/support-grows-nashville-judge-ellen-hobbs-lyle-targeted-lawmaker/6878391002/">sought to remove a judge</a> who had ruled in favor of expanding the right to vote by mail during the pandemic. Last September, the governor and other Republicans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://eu.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2022/09/21/vanderbilt-transgender-clinic-faces-gop-criticism-investigation-republican/69508530007/">lashed out at Vanderbilt University Medical Center</a> , allegedly for suppressing employees who criticized the university&#39;s gender clinic, charges the university denied. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://eu.tennessean.com/story/news/health/2022/09/21/vanderbilt-transgender-clinic-faces-gop-criticism-investigation-republican/69508530007/"> </a>More recently, the state attorney general has investigated the clinic, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tennesseelookout.com/2023/06/22/ag-made-sweeping-demands-for-vanderbilt-transgender-clinic-records-as-part-of-fraud-inquiry/?eType=EmailBlastContent&amp;eId=0bdfc350-1039-4564-94e1-7a42e32a226c">demanding private medical records</a> .<br><br> Sometimes these efforts are clawed back. A determined group of local lawyers and lobbyists helped get some exceptions for the life of the mother enshrined into the state&#39;s abortion ban. A Trump-appointed federal judge <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/13/opinion/tennessee-trump-maga-justin-jones-pearson.html">recently overturned</a> another culture-war gesture, a Tennessee law banning public drag performances, on the grounds that it chilled free speech. But whether individual pieces of hard-line legislation stick might not matter, because part of the point of passing them is just to allow local politicians to align themselves with the general views of that same conservative mediaverse. One example: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://trackbill.com/bill/tennessee-senate-joint-resolution-174-memorials-recognition-danube-institute/2353243/">a recent resolution</a> passed by the legislature to “recognize and commend” Orbán&#39;s think tank, the Danube Institute, which promotes illiberal and antidemocratic ideas. Jones, objecting to that resolution, asked Tim Hicks, the Republican who proposed it, if he knew who Orbán was. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/thetnholler/status/1648811745064935425?s=46&amp;t=QfucpGynsbxt5jS-672ayA">He did not</a> . One disgruntled Republican described this whole process to me as “governing by anecdote.” You could also describe it as “governing by Fox News.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/children-sex-trafficking-conspiracy-epidemic/620845/">From the January/February 2022 issue: The great (fake) child-sex-trafficking epidemic</a><br><br> But every so often, a glimpse of something uglier appears, a hint that some people want more than culture wars designed for TikTok, Twitter, and the evening news. Walking to her home in Nashville, an acquaintance saw a car with a <span class="smallcaps">shoot your local pedophile</span><i> </i>bumper sticker, showing an outline of a man holding a gun to another man&#39;s head. T-shirts with this image, phrasing, and implied approval of violence are for sale online. “This isn&#39;t new to you, but it&#39;s new to us,” she told me, which isn&#39;t quite true. Poland, where I live part of the time, has had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46878325">one political murder</a> in recent years, but it was a knife murder. In Tennessee, people have guns. Jim Cooper, the former member of Congress, told me that getting anyone to run for office as a Democrat in some rural parts of the state is difficult partly because <i>Democrat</i> and <i>pedophile</i> are so often conflated by Republican activists, and potential candidates are spooked. About half of the state-legislature seats were uncontested in 2022.<br><br> Not that the problem of finding Democrats to run for office is new. Cooper also told me that one of his staff used to comb through local newspapers and look for people who had written angry letters to the editor. Then she would call them up and ask them to stand for election. Some said yes. Though most of them lost, he considered that a kind of victory. Jones thinks that after the expulsion crisis, “young people are fired up, bringing urgency to our politics,” and that more candidates will come forward. But there will be a steep road to climb if people fear that what is at stake in their local election is not tax rates and building permits but the safety and even the lives of their children—and if they fight back with real weapons.<br><br> If that possibility sounds ludicrous, or incredible, it shouldn&#39;t. Kanew, the <i>Tennessee Holler</i> editor, woke up one night last April to the sound of gunfire. Someone had shot up the front of his house. No one has yet been arrested.<br><br> “Y <span class="smallcaps">ou know the old saying:</span> All politics is national.” That&#39;s what the mayor of Nashville told me over his ham and eggs. “All politics is national,” several other people said to me too. It&#39;s a joke—“All politics is local” is the old political chestnut—but also not a joke. In the past couple of years, prominent and less-prominent conservatives have been flocking from all over the country to Tennessee and, more precisely, to Williamson County, adjacent to Nashville and, partly thanks to that proximity, now one of the wealthiest counties in the country. The town of Franklin, Williamson&#39;s county seat, has a large and well-lit (I visited at night) monument to the soldiers of the Confederacy. It is also home to equally monumental culture-war clashes and school-board battles that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/opinion/school-boards-books-tennessee.html">can rival those anywhere else in the country</a> . The <i>New York Times</i> columnist David French, who lives there, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/06/opinion/maga-america-trump.html">reckons</a> that “only 15 percent of my neighbors are Democrats.” The Daily Wire, a conservative media company that specializes in culture-war clashes and school-board battles, is now based in Nashville, as are a handful of its stars.<br><br> Total control of a political system can make the victors not more magnanimous, but more frustrated, not least because they learn that total control still doesn&#39;t deliver what they think it should.<br><br> “All politics is national” is also the explanation that a lot of people gave me when I asked how Tennessee went from having a culture of bipartisanship to de facto one-party rule in a mere two decades. Almost everybody wanted to explain that Tennessee politics used to reflect the state&#39;s particular geography (mountains in the east, Mississippi River Delta in the west, rivers and forest in the middle) and complicated history. Some Tennesseans had declared for the Confederacy; others fought against it. The Ku Klux Klan was founded in Pulaski, Tennessee; Nashville was the site of a series of sit-ins that were important to the civil-rights movement. The disgruntled Republicans in particular <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnas.org/publications/blog/two-cheers-for-tennessee">mourn the death</a> of what used to be called “Tennessee enlightened mountain Republicanism,” the liberal, business-oriented party that once challenged the pre-civil-rights “Old South” Democratic one-party state, which relied on Jim Crow and voter suppression. For a long time, both parties celebrated the demise of that system, and no one wanted it back. Or so it seemed.<br><br> By some accounts, the shift began in the 1990s, during the Clinton administration, when talk radio and a confrontational new style of national media began to weaken the local newspapers that people used to read, and the local culture too. Others think the turning point came in the 2000s, when Barack Obama&#39;s presidency produced a racist backlash. In 2012, one poll showed that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/sorry-obama-birtherism-is-alive-and-well-2012-3?IR=T">nearly half of Tennessee Republicans</a> believed in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/birtherism-and-trump/610978/">birtherism conspiracy theory</a> .<br><br> Still others think the harder shift inside the Republican Party began more recently, <i>after</i> it gained full control. John Geer, a Vanderbilt political scientist, told me that whenever a supermajority controls a legislature for a long period of time, “those in the minority have no political ability to effect change, and so they stop acting like politicians and instead become activists,” a thesis that explains the actions of the Tennessee Three, as well as the feeling that politics has become a form of performance art, only distantly related to real life.<br><br> But the supermajority is also affected, and its members become activists of a different kind. To stay in office in a state where few people vote and districts are gerrymandered, Tennessee legislators need to appeal to only a tiny number of very dedicated, very partisan people. The competition for those votes can quite quickly turn into a competition for who can sound most radical. Even the minority leader of the Tennessee State Senate, Raumesh Akbari, a Democrat, told me that it&#39;s harder to do deals with people from heavily gerrymandered districts: “You don&#39;t have anybody to check you and your district is extremely partisan.” Her own district skews heavily Democratic and heavily Black. “If I wasn&#39;t someone who was willing to compromise, I wouldn&#39;t have to,” Akbari said.<br><br> There is another element: Call it the lesson of Sumner County, the place where Republicans won everything, control everything, and yet <i>still</i> feel aggrieved and victimized. As in Hungary or Poland or as in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/02/venezuelas-suffering-shows-where-illiberalism-leads/606988/">Venezuela</a> , the experience of radicalism can make people more radical. Total control of a political system can make the victors not more magnanimous, but more frustrated, not least because they learn that total control still doesn&#39;t deliver what they think it should. No county commission or state legislature can possibly meet the demands of a quasi-religious movement that believes it has God on its side and that its opponents herald the apocalypse. But that doesn&#39;t mean they give up. It just means they keep trying, using any tool available. Eventually they arrive at the point described by Tom Lee, the lawyer for the Sumner County Election Commission: “It&#39;s not enough to get your majority and get your way—they have to make the minority lose their voice.”<br><br> On the tape leaked to <i>The</i> <i>Tennessee Holler</i> after the expulsion of Pearson and Jones, this dynamic is powerfully revealed. Grim Republican legislators talked about what they think is really at stake, and it isn&#39;t megaphones. “If you don&#39;t believe we are at war for our republic,” one of them says to the group, “with all love and respect to you, you need a different job.” They don&#39;t believe that this is a normal political competition, either, or that their opponents are a normal, legitimate, small- <i>d</i> democratic opposition. Democrats, says another, “are not our friends.” They “destroy our republic and the foundation of who we are.” At one point, an apocalyptic tone creeps into the conversation: “The left wants Tennessee so bad because if they get us, the Southeast falls and it&#39;s &#39;game over&#39; for the republic.” So urgent and so dramatic is this challenge that some of them have come to believe that rules might have to be broken: “You gotta do what&#39;s right, even if you think it might be wrong,” one of them says.<br><br> <i>You gotta do what&#39;s right, even if you think it might be wrong. Fight for the republic</i> , <i>because otherwise it will be “game over</i> ”: The language itself wouldn&#39;t be unusual, if this were a radical minority fighting for its very existence. But this is the Republican Party, the party that controls pretty much everything in Tennessee. They are going to win the next election, and probably the one after that. Yet they sound as if winning isn&#39;t enough: They also want their opponents to fall silent, and they are doing what they can to make that happen.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 18 Jul 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/tennessee-republican-partisanship-one-party-state/674732/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/tennessee-republican-partisanship-one-party-state/674732/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why the Remote-Work Debate Stays So Heated]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The conversation often foregrounds large-scale issues such as productivity and company culture, but the question of where an employee works is intensely personal. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/C9uTFuz-5brHPsAys00WYgH6Pc8=/0x266:5121x3147/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_862664210/original.jpg" alt="人们在夜间经过一座建筑物" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Peter Cade / Getty</figcaption></figure> <small><i>This is an edition of</i> The Atlantic <i>Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a></small><br><br> The physical space in which a person works, or hopes to work, intersects with their most personal choices.

It was not the allure of watercooler chatter or the promise of juiced-up productivity that pulled me in. At the time, I just really wanted to sit in the AC. It was June; it was hot. Access to a desk in a freezing-cold Midtown tower—a far cry from my living room, which tended to get steamy on 90-degree Brooklyn days—seemed like a major perk. I was living with roommates, was vaccinated, and had no child-care duties. Each morning, I strapped on my mask and packed my backpack with canisters of coffee and sandwiches to sustain me through the day. I often felt better when I got home: When you&#39;re going into an office, I found, it&#39;s harder to have a day where nothing happens.<br><br> My desire to return to a routine that involved leaving my home was inspired, in part, by my now-colleague Ellen Cushing&#39;s 2021 <i>Atlantic</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/03/what-pandemic-doing-our-brains/618221/">article</a> about what the monotony of the pandemic was doing to our brain. “Sometimes I imagine myself as a Sim, a diamond-shaped cursor hovering above my head as I go about my day. Tasks appear, and I do them. Mealtimes come, and I eat. Needs arise, and I meet them,” she writes in one memorable passage. In another, she quotes an expert saying that “environmental enrichment”—seeing new people, observing new things on a commute—is good for our brain&#39;s plasticity. After reading the article in March 2021, I became fixated on the idea that observing random humans on my commute would keep my mind sharp.<br><br> Then the fall came around, and so did more of my colleagues. It was great to see them. It was also great, sometimes, to return to the relative solitude of my home and take walks in Prospect Park at midday. I was lucky to have that flexibility. Now that I work for <i>The Atlantic</i> , I go into the office almost every day. I have enjoyed meeting new people and, again, sitting in the industrial-grade AC.<br><br> I&#39;ve given you this narration of my personal experience because, for all the talk of productivity and metrics and company culture, the topic of returning to the office is intensely personal. My needs and desires, for a variety of reasons relating to my age, finances, circumstances, health situation, and lifestyle, might be very different from those of workers who fall elsewhere on any of those axes. Some working parents have said they might value flexibility at school-pickup time. Some workers of color have raised the benefit of being free from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/research-the-real-time-impact-of-microaggressions">in-office microaggressions</a> . Recent college graduates may want to go into the office to make friends. And of course, not all workers are able to work remotely. The physical space in which one works, or hopes to work, intersects with one&#39;s most personal choices. It collides with and reveals what people value most.<br><br> Nick Bloom, a Stanford economics professor who studies remote work, told me that “research and evidence are slowly catching up” to the work-from-home debate. In five years, he predicted, the topic will be less controversial. Bloom and two colleagues, Jose Maria Barrero and Steven J. Davis, published a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kqbngD8pemqxAkZmWCOQ32Yk6PXK9eVA/view">working paper</a> earlier this month that collects some of the existing work-from-home research, pulling both from their own work and from other papers. One interesting finding is that although fully remote work has been correlated with a drop in productivity, hybrid work (which occurs widely in white-collar fields such as tech and business services) was not linked to any productivity loss—and could actually <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://siepr.stanford.edu/publications/working-paper/evolution-working-home">help with recruitment and retention</a> .<br><br> Workers gained freedom over their working conditions in the past few years. Now <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/20/business/return-to-office-remote-work.html">many bosses</a> are trying to wrest that power back. And workers and managers don&#39;t always see eye to eye about the stakes of returning to work. Bloom and his colleagues asked managers and employees about how working from home affected productivity. Workers, on the whole, said they were 7.4 percent more productive on average while working from home; bosses said that they thought their employees were 3.5 percent less productive. Managers tend to most appreciate what they can see in front of them, Bloom told me over email: “It&#39;s like those restaurants where the kitchen is open and on display—it feels more like you are having a fantastic culinary experience, but it&#39;s really just a mirage.”<br><br> Companies&#39; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/31/business/work-home-return-office-amazon.html">rationales</a> for calling people back to work can seem mushy, beyond that it simply seems like being together would be better (or, in some cases, that employers want to fulfill expensive real-estate obligations). One argument for working in person is the idea that younger workers can learn from, and be mentored by, more experienced colleagues in the workplace. Bloom told me that senior managers over the age of 50 provide about 50 percent of the mentoring minutes when working from home as they do while in the office. “A lot of mentoring is casual, relaxed conversations and, yes, it&#39;s spontaneous—taking somebody aside and giving some quick advice,” he said. A Pew Research Center survey from March found that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/30/about-a-third-of-us-workers-who-can-work-from-home-do-so-all-the-time/">36 percent of teleworkers</a> said remote work hurt their opportunities to be mentored. Positive remote mentoring can happen (I found a formal mentorship program conducted mostly over Zoom very useful). Bloom said that although in theory—and with the right software—these types of relationships can blossom, “practically this does not happen as much online.”<br><br> Bloom&#39;s point (and my reaction to it) reinforces how personal experience can color perspectives on this issue: In my case, I both relish time away from home and believe in the potential of remote mentor relationships. But how those dimensions of work fit into our lives can vary widely. Change any inputs—personal commute time, age, nature of work, child-care responsibilities, goals—and the resulting approach may be unrecognizable.<br><br> <b>Related</b> :<br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/03/us-remote-work-impact-fertility-rate-babies/673301/">The surprising effects of remote work</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/good-management-mentorship-remote-world/621219/">How to mentor young workers in a remote world</a></li> <strong>Today&#39;s News</strong><br><br><li> Russia is halting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/world/europe/ukraine-russia-grain-deal.html">Black Sea Grain Initiative</a> , which ensured that Ukraine could export its grain by sea despite a wartime blockade and helped stabilize global food prices.</li><li> Senator Joe Manchin&#39;s decision to headline an event with the No Labels organization is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senator-manchin-speech-stokes-speculation-white-house-run-2023-07-17/">fueling speculation</a> over a potential third-party presidential run.</li><li> Firefighters are <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/16/us/california-wildfires-extreme-heat/index.html">battling several wildfires</a> in Southern California that ignited this weekend amid excessive heat warnings.</li> <b>Evening Read</b><br><br> Do Yourself a Favor and Go Find a &#39;Third Place&#39;<br><br> <em>By Allie Conti</em><br><br><p> On a Sunday last year, I was walking through a suburban neighborhood in Pennsylvania, heading home from an early-afternoon meditation class. One of the nondescript stucco houses had a curious sticker on its mailbox reading mac&#39;s club. I checked Google Maps to see if I was standing next to a cleverly disguised business—what might pretentiously be referred to in a city as a speakeasy—but nothing popped up, so I peeked inside the house. That&#39;s where I spotted a pool table and a middle-aged guy sitting at the end of a long, mahogany bar, drinking a Bloody Mary by himself. Apparently I&#39;d stumbled upon a social club meant for residents of the neighborhood. Though at first the bartender was incredulous that I&#39;d just walked in, he soon rewarded my sense of adventure with a Guinness on the house. The Eagles weren&#39;t playing in the NFL that day, and he was grateful for the additional company. We talked about the upcoming deer season, and upon learning that I was a new hunter, the two guys showed me a rifle that was kept in another room. ……</p><p> Besides giving me the feeling that I&#39;d flexed a muscle that had atrophied, the interaction was special to me because I&#39;d found a classic “third place” in the suburbs, where I least expected it. The term, which was coined by the sociologist Ray Oldenburg in the 1980s, essentially refers to a physical location other than work or home where there&#39;s little to no financial barrier to entry and where conversation is the primary activity.</p> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/04/third-places-meet-new-people-pandemic/629468/">Read the full article.</a><br><br> <b>More From <em>The Atlantic</em></b><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/alabama-execution-jimi-barber/674708/">Elizabeth Bruenig: Alabama wants to kill Jimi Barber.</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/rfk-kennedy-covid-anti-semitism/674727/">The most shocking aspect of RFK Jr.&#39;s anti-Semitism</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/dominos-deliver-uber-eats-app/674716/">Delivery apps just did the impossible.</a></li> <b>Culture Break</b><br><br> <b>Read.</b> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/mozart-in-motion-his-work-and-his-world-in-pieces-patrick-mackie/9780374606206?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Mozart in Motion</i></a> , by the British poet Patrick Mackie, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/mozart-in-motion-book-review-music/674726/">explores the secret to Mozart&#39;s lasting appeal</a> .<br><br> <b>Watch.</b> Beneath the hijinks and lewdness, the show <i>Dave</i> (streaming on Hulu) constructs <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/dave-fx-tv-show-male-friendship/674719/">an unlikely model</a> for male friendship.<br><br><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/free-daily-crossword-puzzle/">Play our daily crossword.</a><br><br> <strong>PS</strong><br><br> I like to bake, and find doing so relaxing.

The 160,000 members</a> of SAG-AFTRA, led by Fran Drescher, the fearless sitcom nanny, stopped working after talks with the studios collapsed. They join the ranks of the Writers Guild of America, whose members (myself included) have been on strike since May.<br><br> Our two unions have not been on strike together since 1960. The writers&#39; pickets at shooting locations had already shut down an estimated 80 percent of productions. Now SAG&#39;s strike rules dictate that actors not only can&#39;t shoot or do voice-over work for productions; they also cannot attend red carpets or promote any Motion Picture Association projects—something that was already a challenge, given that the writers&#39; strike had shut down the nighttime talk shows that were such a staple of the press circuit.<br><br> Much like the writers, actors are looking for increases in their residual pay—compensation that&#39;s akin to royalty checks—once-reliable income that has all but vanished in the pivot to streaming. Actors are also seeking protections against artificial intelligence using their voice and image.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/writers-guild-of-america-strike-residuals-pay-streaming/673876/">Xochitl Gonzalez: &#39;The whole thing starts with us&#39;</a><br><br> Bob Iger, Disney&#39;s CEO, called these expectations “just not realistic.” He accused the strikers of “adding to a set of challenges that this business is already facing that is quite frankly very disruptive and dangerous.”<br><br> This was a bit rich, coming days after a studio executive told <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/writers-strike-hollywood-studios-deal-fight-wga-actors-1235434335/"><i>Deadline</i></a> that their strategy was “to allow things to drag on until union members start losing their apartments and losing their houses.”<br><br> Eviction is a pretty cruel labor-negotiation strategy.<br><br> Hollywood&#39;s CEOs <i>are</i> suffering. Not primarily from labor disputes or industry disruption or public-relations issues, but from vincible ignorance, which seems to be endemic in C-suites of all industries. Under pressure to deliver to Wall Street, too many CEOs have lost the plot of their own movie. They are not running companies to profitably deliver a good product, such as a book or a cup of coffee or, in this case, a movie or TV show. They are running companies to deliver good profit. The quality of their product has ceased to matter.<br><br> If you doubt this, consider that when Emmy nominations were announced last week, the lions&#39; share went to HBO Max, a prestige platform that has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.insiderintelligence.com/content/charting-new-course-adapting-advertising-landscape-after-hbo-max-discovery-merger">ceased to exist by that name</a> , because Warner Bros. Discovery took the streaming arm of the legacy brand and folded it into a messy app crowded with low-budget reality programs. We are in the upside-down.<br><br> Writers and actors have been caught up in the pivot to streaming, the mad logic of which has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/writers-guild-contract-negotiation-mini-room-1235568173/">upended long-standing working practices</a> , slowly begun to replace human instinct with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18637135/hollywood-ai-film-decision-script-analysis-data-machine-learning">artificial intelligence</a> , and obliterated workers&#39; income streams.<br><br> The actor Mark Proksch, for example, made more money off residuals from one season of guest appearances on <i>The Office</i> ,<i> </i>under the old system, than he has in five seasons of starring in <i>What We Do in the Shadows</i> , under the new system <i>.</i><br><br> Now, just as Hollywood workers are arguing that we need to adjust our compensation models to fit the streaming era, the studios are telling us that we cannot be fairly paid, because the streaming model is broken. And we&#39;re being told this by the very studio executives—many of them <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/05/ceo-pay-wga-writers-strike-1235351572/">multimillionaires</a> —who broke it.<br><br> This is another aspect of C-suite ignorance: Bonkers executive compensation has utterly detached leaders from the lives of the people they employ. The fact that David Zaslav, the CEO of Warner Bros. and Discovery, earned $247 million in 2021 makes it very hard to swallow his refusal to budge on issues that are costing middle-class actors thousands of dollars a year in lost income.<br><br> You can argue all you like about whether anyone should ever earn this much, but these are leaders who have made some disastrous business decisions.<br><br> The pivot to streaming was extremely profitable for the brief moment when everyone was trapped at home during a pandemic. People couldn&#39;t spend money on concerts or eating out or traveling, so they felt comfortable spending an abnormal amount on streaming services.<br><br> Hollywood CEOs saw the success of Netflix and raced to copy a model without knowing whether it was sustainable, a model that relied on the constant production of new (and costly) entertainment content created by unionized talent. They were wrong about the business, but they were even more wrong to presume that labor would comply. The actors and writers didn&#39;t make this pivot; why should they pay the price?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/05/hollywood-writers-strike-wga/673926/">Read: Why you should pay attention to the Hollywood writers&#39; strike</a><br><br> If the pivot to streaming was such a mistake that these businesses truly are going under—a case that&#39;s hard to make, given the size of these executives&#39; compensation packages—we will have to suffer too. But if we suffer during lean times, we should also share in the profits during fat ones. That is what the negotiations are about. The only way that executives will be able to right this ship is to return to making unmissable programming, and they won&#39;t be able to do that without us.<br><br> Absent good script writers, Hollywood executives have taken their lines from Marie Antoinette. But the revolutionaries are already outside, dismantling the palace. In London, the cast of <i>Oppenheimer</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/oppenheimer-stars-walk-out-london-premiere-actors-strike-emily-blunt-matt-damon-florence-pugh-cillian-murphy/">walked out</a> of the film&#39;s premiere.

Lieberman and his former party have been warring for years, ever since he won a fourth Senate term, in 2006, as an independent after Connecticut Democrats dumped him in a primary. Suddenly liberated, Lieberman endorsed the Republican John McCain over Barack Obama in 2008 and proceeded to tank the Democrats&#39; dreams of enacting a public health-insurance program through the Affordable Care Act.<br><br> He&#39;s now a co-chair of No Labels, the centrist group that, to the growing alarm of Democrats, is preparing to field a third-party presidential ticket in 2024. The organization&#39;s leaders say they&#39;re trying to save voters from a binary rematch between Trump and President Joe Biden that most Americans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/25/2024-trump-biden-presidential-rematch">have told pollsters</a> they don&#39;t want. But Democrats and more than a few Republicans fear that such a plan might ensure exactly what Lieberman insists he would hate to see: Trump&#39;s return to the White House. Both No Labels&#39; own polling and independent surveys <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/07/12/no-labels-poll-third-party-manchin">have shown</a> that a “moderate, independent” candidate could capture as much as 20 percent of the popular vote and would pull more of that support from Biden than from Trump. If the 2024 election is as close as 2020&#39;s—and pretty much every political prognosticator believes it will be—that could be decisive.<br><br> No Labels has already lost one of its co-founders, William Galston, over its push for a third-party ticket; Galston <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/no-labels-may-re-elect-donald-trump-third-party-independent-galston-rematch-f2e7697d">resigned in protest</a> this spring over the possibility that the bid could tip the election to Trump. Democratic members of the No Labels–backed Problem Solvers Caucus in the House have disavowed the effort for the same reason. The moderate Democratic group Third Way is adamantly opposed to the idea, and a new bipartisan group <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/11/gephardt-no-labels-third-party/">is forming</a> to stop it.<br><br> For now, Lieberman is undeterred. “I think people in both parties, particularly the Democrats, are greatly overreacting,” Lieberman told me. “They really would do better to try to build up support for their own ticket and adopt a platform that&#39;s more to the center.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/proportional-representation-house-congress/674627/">Read: A radical idea for fixing polarization</a><br><br> Founded by the Democratic fundraiser Nancy Jacobson, No Labels launched in 2010 with an initial focus on promoting centrist policies and breaking partisan gridlock in Congress during the Obama presidency. It formed the Problem Solvers Caucus in 2017 and has touted some of the major bipartisan bills that have passed with Biden&#39;s support, including the 2021 infrastructure law. It is now putting significant money behind an idea—a so-called unity ticket featuring one Democrat and one Republican—that has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2007/02/unity08-plans-to-field-fusion-ticket-aimed-at-moderates-002657">come up</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2019/01/17/bipartisan-presidential-unity-ticket-heal-divided-america-2020-column/2583404002/">repeatedly</a> over the past two decades but never actually materialized. Leaders of No Labels have said they won&#39;t decide whether to nominate a ticket until the spring, when they would assess the major-party nominees and see what polling shows about the effect a third-party bid might have. So far they&#39;ve refused to discuss who their actual candidates might be.<br><br> Citing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://roar-assets-auto.rbl.ms/files/52325/HarrisX%20No%20Labels%20-%20Insurance%20Policy%20Data%20-%2030%20March%202023%20-%20VF.pdf">a large poll</a> the group commissioned in December, No Labels has argued that a third-party ticket could win enough states—including some that are deeply red and deeply blue—to capture the Electoral College. Lieberman acknowledged that that remains a tall order. He said No Labels wanted a potential unity ticket to play “a constructive role” even if it didn&#39;t win, drawing both parties back toward the ideological middle. They are hoping, for example, that one of the two parties will embrace the “Common Sense” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.commonsensemajority.org/_files/ugd/9f0726_a8092681d4cc40ae8623b98b83d3853d.pdf">policy agenda</a> it released yesterday. It&#39;s not clear, however, that this would make Biden or Trump any more palatable to voters.<br><br> The group&#39;s lodestar is the late Ross Perot, who captured 19 percent of the vote in 1992 and was the last third-party candidate to draw significant popular support. Lieberman credits Perot&#39;s bid for prompting President Bill Clinton to embrace policies that led to a balanced federal budget; many Republicans believe the Texas businessman cost George HW Bush a second term. More recent third-party candidates such as Jill Stein in 2016 have garnered much less support but played more obvious spoiler roles, delivering Republican presidential victories. And Lieberman, who was Al Gore&#39;s running mate in 2000, is well aware of the impact that Ralph Nader had in that election, when he took crucial votes away from the Democratic ticket in Florida.<br><br> “When I look at the data next year, I&#39;m going to be very cautious about interpreting it,” Lieberman said. “If it appears that, notwithstanding our goals, we may create a real risk of inadvertently helping to reelect Donald Trump, I will be strongly opposed to running a third-party ticket. And I think I&#39;m reflecting a majority of people in No Labels, including the leadership.”<br><br> For all of Lieberman&#39;s talk about caution, however, the group is aggressively laying the groundwork for what it calls a national “insurance policy” against a Biden-Trump rematch. No Labels is pursuing a $70 million effort to secure ballot access in every state and has already made progress in a few important battlegrounds. Today, Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia and former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman will headline the formal launch of the group&#39;s “Common Sense” agenda in New Hampshire. Manchin has not ruled out running for president on a No Labels ticket, although he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1679178567756791808">insisted to CNN</a> that his high-profile visit to the early-primary state was no indication that he&#39;s warming to the idea.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/how-moderates-could-actually-take-control-washington/620599/">Matthew Yglesias and Steven M. Teles: A moderate proposal</a><br><br> Lieberman is clear about his distaste for Trump, but he&#39;s hazier on the question of why—or even whether—Biden has fallen short. He&#39;s said repeatedly that if the choice came down to Biden or Trump, he&#39;d vote for the Democrat, and he speaks affectionately of a man he first met nearly 40 years ago and with whom he served for 20 years in the Senate. Yet he&#39;s still hunting for a better option. I asked him whether he supported a third-party ticket because Biden had done a bad job or because voters <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/">think</a> he&#39;s done a bad job. “I think it&#39;s both,” Lieberman replied. “He&#39;s an honorable person, but he&#39;s been pulled off his normal track too often” by pressure from the left. That&#39;s a frequent talking point from Republicans and a complaint Manchin has made from time to time.<br><br> The perception that Biden has veered too far to the left, though, is not what <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/12/democrats-biden-approval-rating/621048/">has driven</a> his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/broad-doubts-bidens-age-acuity-spell-republican-opportunity/story?id=99109308#:~:text=President%20Joe%20Biden's%20job%20approval,in%20early%20preferences%20for%202024.">low approval ratings</a> . Indeed, in many ways Biden is the kind of president for whom moderates like Lieberman have long been clamoring. Yes, he signed two major bills that passed along purely party-line votes (the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act a year later), but he has repeatedly prioritized negotiating with Republicans, most recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/05/biden-gop-debt-ceiling-negotiation/674070/">over the debt ceiling</a> . Lieberman credited Biden for his bipartisan infrastructure law and the budget deal he struck with House Speaker Kevin McCarthy this spring. “He&#39;s done some significant things,” Lieberman said, also praising the president&#39;s initial handling of the coronavirus pandemic. When I asked him what specifically Biden had veered too far left on, he initially declined to list any issues. Then he pointed to No Labels&#39; policy plan, noting that it included “commonsense” proposals on guns and immigration.<br><br> Although he&#39;s been out of office for more than a decade, Lieberman, at 81, is less than a year older than Biden. He said he believes the president remains up to the job, both physically and cognitively, and he was reluctant to call on him to stand down. But Lieberman gently suggested that might have been the better course. “I&#39;m struck by how intent he is on running again,” he said with a chuckle. “It would have been easier for him not to run, and he could retire with a real sense of pride and just an enormously productive career in public service.”<br><br> Lieberman&#39;s response subtly pointed to No Labels&#39; hope that, come springtime, their decision will be an easy one. Perhaps Biden will change his mind and withdraw, or Trump&#39;s legal woes will finally persuade Republican voters to look elsewhere. At the moment, neither of those scenarios seems likely.<br><br> Lieberman and his allies might decide that nominating a third-party ticket won&#39;t help reelect Trump, but that&#39;s not something they can know for sure. I asked Lieberman: If he was so intent on keeping Trump out of office, wasn&#39;t that too big a risk to take? He didn&#39;t have a clear answer. “Yeah,” he replied. “I mean, we&#39;ll see.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 17 Jul 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/joe-lieberman-interview-no-labels-2024-election/674711/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/joe-lieberman-interview-no-labels-2024-election/674711/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[An Unlikely Model for Male Friendship]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Beneath the hijinks and lewdness, the show <em>Dave</em> charts how real vulnerability is essential to male bonding. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/eX98TEiP7hMw4Gw40ESacalsFuA=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/dave_bromance/original.jpg" alt="《戴夫》中的一个场景中，两个男人坐在地上交谈。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> ByronCohen / FX</figcaption></figure> The last memory I have of a certain former friendship, one of singular intimacy and closeness, involves watching an episode of the FXX show <em>Dave</em> . It was two summers ago, and a few of us had gathered for his birthday. As the night waned, slices of cake crumbling and cans of beer warming, we watched the show. We guffawed and recognized bits of ourselves in the group of strivers who were all trying, in some form, to <em>make it</em> . At the time, I was ignorant of the fact that my friendship would end abruptly the next day. But in the aftermath of that breakup, as I attempted to cope with the pain, I was surprised by how much <em>Dave</em> would also illuminate my notions of friendship—and its complications.<br><br> <em>Dave</em> is a loosely autobiographical show about Dave Burd, aka Lil Dicky, a white rapper who in real life has had modest success: In 2016, he was featured in <em>XXL</em> magazine&#39;s influential “Freshman Issue” alongside Lil Yachty, 21 Savage, Anderson .Paak, and Lil Uzi Vert, among others. The show is also, more absurdly, one that focuses on Lil Dicky&#39;s small, deformed penis (the result of a rare birth defect and several surgeries), which the artist fully embraces both inside and outside the series for body positivity as well as schtick. (Just consider his moniker.) Assembled in the show around Dave are friends who have been absorbed by his ambition to become a global star. Imagine combining Larry David&#39;s neurosis with Kanye West&#39;s hubris with a lighthearted genitalia fixation and you might conjure a decent approximation of the protagonist.<br><br> Much like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/03/atlanta-season-3-review/629394/"><em>Atlanta</em></a> , <em>Dave</em> is hilarious, moody, artfully shot, and a commentary on contemporary American hip-hop culture. Many rappers and celebrities appear as themselves to comedic effect, and the series cleverly pokes fun at the obvious perils of a white dude seeking fame through a Black art form. But look past the hijinks and the studio sessions thick with smoke, bravado, and dick jokes, and <em>Dave</em> is fundamentally a show about male friendship that complicates the typically reductive on-screen bromance. It has some of the most raw depictions of male bonding on TV today, illustrating how race, culture, and ambition can both define—and confine—how men relate to one another. Even more important, the show attempts to convey how real vulnerability might be the best hope we have of transcending those barriers.<br><br> Early in Season 1, we meet Mike, Dave&#39;s ginger-headed roommate and close friend who becomes his manager. The two are touchingly familiar—it isn&#39;t unusual for them to part with unironic <em>I love you</em> ’s or bathe together, with Mike trying out various ointments to cure the acne on Dave&#39;s back. The scene that sets up the latter ritual takes place in a supermarket aisle with another character, the frenetic GaTa (pronounced like <em>gator</em> ), Dave&#39;s newest friend in LA and eventual hype man. Mike sidles up to them with a basket of new oils to try in the tub, expressing such earnest excitement that I found myself awaiting a punch line. But there wasn&#39;t one, and I was left to check my reflexive reaction to what platonic male intimacy could look like.<br><br> At this point, <em>Dave</em> ’s core friend group—and its unique dynamic—is taking shape. Elz, Dave&#39;s wry producer and childhood best friend, played by Travis Bennett (aka Yung Taco from the rap group Odd Future), is soon added to the fold. Each character is allowed to be unique in his own way: absurd, misguided, extreme. Though race certainly inflects these relationships—Elz and GaTa are Black; Dave and Mike are white—the group is so raucous and tender that occasional tensions seldom disrupt their closeness.<br><br> Neither do profoundly personal issues. For instance, later in Season 1, at a rehearsal for an upcoming concert, GaTa&#39;s energy is visibly off. Dave, Mike, and Elz can see that he&#39;s pacing and overly agitated, but are frustrated about his seeming lack of preparedness. GaTa eventually sits on the couch and confesses that he&#39;s bipolar. He has a “chemical imbalance,” he admits, through tears, and he takes eight to 10 pills a night to cope. Moved by GaTa&#39;s vulnerability, the group rallies around him, and clearly begins to understand the intricate engine that powers their friend. The show thrums with this kind of collective revelation followed by understanding. Every time it occurs, the bonds among the four thicken further. Rewatching this episode, I thought of my former friend, and how hard it is to know what someone is going through or how much of it they&#39;ve chosen to share. In order for a relationship to sustain itself and grow, curiosity must search out new things to know—and to love.<br><br> In a time of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/01/loneliness-solitude-pandemic-habit/672631/">deep alienation, estrangement, and loneliness</a> , such portrayals of male companionship are refreshing. For a long while, the bromances I most saw on-screen were in buddy-cop films such as the <em>Bad Boys</em> and <em>Lethal Weapon</em> franchises, where affection is earned after displays of strength or courage. Even newer and earnestly affectionate comedies such as <em>I Love You, Man</em> don&#39;t focus as squarely as <em>Dave</em> does on how beautiful the romance of male friendship can be. On the show, effusive intimacy isn&#39;t something reached after a villain has been defeated or a romantic conflict overcome, but is terrain worthy of exploration in itself.<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/06/six-ways-make-maintain-friends/661232/">Read: The six forces that fuel friendship</a><br><br> Yet as male intimacy appears more and more in pop culture, so, too, does the complicated nature of its rupture. Hua Hsu&#39;s potent memoir, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/stay-true-a-memoir-hua-hsu/9780385547772?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Stay True</em></a> (which, full disclosure, I designed the cover for), is a forensic reconstruction of a close friendship from college, written decades after a tragedy. Martin McDonagh&#39;s darkly funny film <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/10/banshees-of-inisherin-2022-movie-review/671801/"><em>The Banshees of Inisherin</em></a> depicts the swift falling out between two old friends in a small Irish town, and the ways they struggle to cope.<br><br> <em>Dave</em> also contends artfully with separations between men—and plots one way to heal them. Friendships that grow from childhood can become complicated in adulthood, and this is embodied by the relationship of Elz and Dave, who have been thick as thieves from the age of 6. In one of Season 2&#39;s standout episodes, Dave is paid a large fee to perform at a bar mitzvah in LA He and Elz have been sniping at each other—Elz is exhausted by Dave&#39;s monomania, and Dave is jealous of Elz&#39;s success working for more established rappers.<br><br> The animosity between them builds slowly, culminating in a game of one-on-one basketball as the bar mitzvah is being set up, their antagonism expressed in a series of quick cuts. The pair best each other with jump shots and drives; jabbed elbows, sweat, and grunts. They&#39;re working out what language has failed to, physically sublimating their pain, which, unsurprisingly, proves an inadequate way to resolve conflict. Their predicament, the show suggests, is a result of the two having lost their ability to communicate openly. Still, by the episode&#39;s end, when the party&#39;s host boots Dave for the terrible influence he&#39;s been on his son, Elz and Dave remember their antics at bar mitzvahs as kids, and summon the less-egoistic joy of their youthful transgressions. In an act of playful defiance, they open the gate penning in a herd of farm animals hired for entertainment and set them free.<br><br> This is typical of how conflicts between friends resolve on <em>Dave</em> : with a reminder that individual pride isn&#39;t worth threatening their bonds. Season 3, which ended in May, is more preoccupied with traditional romance, as each character navigates dating, falling in love, and sex, though their friendships still evolve. But in the penultimate episode, a documentary of Lil Dicky&#39;s tour is screened for the characters, featuring candid testimonials about Dave from his friends. The confessions are biting and loving in equal measure, and I found myself asking what my friends would say if they ever had such a chance. I wondered, in particular, what the friend I lost might offer.<br><br> Naturally, I played a role in the end of our friendship, but not knowing exactly <em>how</em> is a constant torment. We had no one-on-one game through which to try to work things out, let alone a joint moment of vulnerable frustration. The reason we&#39;d watched <em>Dave</em> that summer night was because I&#39;d insisted there were certain scenes he would appreciate; many references that used the lingua franca of our group. And I was right. I remember the satisfaction of his laughter. In hindsight, I wish it had prompted him to say whatever had been on his mind. I wish I&#39;d been curious enough to ask before it was too late.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 17 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/dave-fx-tv-show-male-friendship/674719/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/dave-fx-tv-show-male-friendship/674719/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Most Shocking Aspect of RFK Jr.’s Anti-Semitism]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> What&#39;s surprising isn&#39;t that Kennedy voiced an anti-Jewish conspiracy, but that it took this long. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/rxpGHPhlsK812tEHTXc5twzmss8=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/rfk_illo_horz/original.jpg" alt="小罗伯特·RFK" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Jamie McCarthy / Getty.</figcaption></figure> Last week, at a dinner event in Manhattan, the Democratic primary candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shared his unvarnished thoughts about the nature of the coronavirus. “There&#39;s an argument that it is ethnically targeted,” he explained, in remarks <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/15/rfk-jr-says-covid-was-ethnically-targeted-to-spare-jews/">captured on video</a> . “COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.” To be sure, Kennedy added, “we don&#39;t know whether it was deliberately targeted or not.” In other words, Kennedy apparently believes it is an open question whether the pandemic was engineered by a shadowy cabal to spare Chinese and Jewish people.<br><br> At least 1 million people in China have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/02/china-million-covid-deaths-communist-party/673177/">died</a> from COVID-19; far from being immune to the virus, Jews in places like New York were often <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bklyner.com/editorial-stop-blaming-orthodox-jews-blame-trump-for-brooklyn-covid-spikes/">unfairly accused</a> of spreading it. As a Jew who had his own bout with the coronavirus, Kennedy&#39;s claims were news to me. But given the source, they also weren&#39;t a surprise. That&#39;s because Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist, and the arc of conspiracy is short and bends toward the Jews.<br><br> Here is just a small sampling of what Kennedy <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/rfk-jr-2024-election-anti-establishment-voters/674588/">believes</a> : that radiation from wireless internet <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D3OkKer7Ohw">causes</a> cancer; that chemicals in the water supply are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/politics/robert-kennedy-jr-chemicals-water-children-frogs/index.html">producing gender dysphoria</a> ; that the CIA killed both his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/arts-letters/articles/robert-f-kennedy-jr-interview-david-samuels#:~:text=he%20was%20also%20a%20CIA%20asset">father</a> and his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/3993563-robert-kennedy-jr-sees-overwhelming-evidence-cia-involved-in-jfk-assassination/">uncle</a> , President John F.

As I&#39;ve <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-george-soros-anti-semites/674072/">written before</a> :<br><br><p> Anti-Semitism is arguably the world&#39;s <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/texas-synagogue-anti-semitism-conspiracy-theory/621286/">oldest and most durable</a> conspiracy theory. It presents Jews as the string-pulling puppet masters behind the world&#39;s political, economic, and social problems. For those seeking simple solutions to life&#39;s complexities, this outlook offers a ready-made explanation—and enemy. Anyone seeking a single source for society&#39;s travails may start with run-of-the-mill conspiracy theories but will soon end up parroting anti-Jewish ideas.</p> Because anti-Semitism has produced centuries of material pinning humanity&#39;s problems on its Jews, a person convinced that an invisible hand is conducting world affairs will eventually discover that it belongs to an invisible Jew.<br><br> For this reason, it is impossible to circulate on the conspiratorial fringe and not encounter anti-Semitism. This is why Kennedy has constantly found himself in the company of those who believe and express anti-Jewish ideas. Last week, he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1678528085258301440">trumpeted</a> his meeting with the rapper Ice Cube, a fellow conspiracy theorist who has a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/ice-cube-criticized-anti-semitic-images-conspiracy-theories-9400472/">long history</a> of bizarre anti-Semitic tweets and song lyrics. In the past, Kennedy has also made <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/LouisFarrakhan/status/614862836431392769">common</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4910041/user-clip-rfk-jr-told-louis-farrakhan-cdc-kill-black-boys">cause</a> with the hate preacher Louis Farrakhan, who regularly rails against alleged Jewish control of media and government.<br><br> That Kennedy would ultimately echo the anti-Semitic assumptions of his conspiratorial cohort was inevitable. Indeed, he is far from the first traveler on the well-trodden path from conspiracism to outright anti-Semitism. In recent years, individuals as diverse as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/deep-shtetl/61897999d581bf0020f74c32/why-rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-just-championed-louis-farrakhan/">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/why-its-become-harder-to-joke-about-anti-semitism/672120/">Kyrie Irving</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-george-soros-anti-semites/674072/">Elon Musk</a> have graduated from garden-variety conspiracy theories to anti-Jewish arguments. Even the content of Kennedy&#39;s COVID-19 conjecture isn&#39;t original: Jews have been blamed for spreading plagues for centuries, most famously during Europe&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-black-death">Black Death</a> .<br><br> Over the weekend, Kennedy furiously tweeted denials and clarifications, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1680227322509635595">insisting</a> that he meant only that COVID served “as a kind of proof of concept for ethnically targeted bioweapons,” not that “the ethnic effect was deliberately engineered,” though he&#39;d clearly raised that exact possibility in his original remarks.<br><br> Kennedy himself has no prior history of anti-Semitism, and has never evinced personal prejudice toward Jewish people.
