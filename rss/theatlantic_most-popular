class="smallcaps">如此之少</span>，以至于有一个特殊的绰号“监狱皈依”来驳斥这种现象。但我从来没有意识到，像一个被判犯有滔天罪行的人那样<em>需要</em>救赎，会使这个人的渴望必然是不诚实的；我更倾向于以相反的方式看待它。在詹姆斯·“吉米”·巴伯的例子中，他需要救赎。<br><br>巴伯可能是第一个告诉你这些的人。在他看来，他自己的生命在 2001 年 5 月的那个晚上结束了，当时他在吸食可卡因和酗酒的过程中，在阿拉巴马州乡村的家中谋杀了 75 岁的祖母多萝西·“多蒂”·埃普斯 (Dorothy “Dottie” Epps)，但他并没有杀死她。只是因为这预示着他自己的死刑，但从某种意义上说，他在那场疯狂的暴力行为中摧毁了许多珍贵的关系。多蒂是巴伯前女友的母亲，巴伯与这个家庭关系密切，参加了女友侄女的高中毕业典礼，并在多蒂孙子婚礼前为多蒂的房子工作。但所有这一切——艰难生活中有意义的关系——在一夜之间突然被浪费了，巴伯知道这一点。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/james-barber-alabama-death-row-forgiveness/674181/">伊丽莎白·布鲁尼格：谋杀被宽恕</a><br><br>他在 2020 年秋天寄给多蒂的孙女莎拉·格雷戈里<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/james-barber-alabama-death-row-forgiveness/674181/">的一封信中</a>，向多蒂的孙女莎拉·格雷戈里讲述了自己的罪行。“自我厌恶、羞耻、震惊和对自己亲手发生的事情的彻底怀疑几乎征服了我，”他写道。 “如果没有上帝的恩典，我就会消失。”巴伯告诉格雷戈里，他最初很难适应监狱里的生活：“我经常打架，有一段时间几乎每天都打架。我的羞耻、愤怒、否认以及[监禁]的“文化冲击”超出了我的承受能力。我猛烈抨击任何构成威胁的人，无论是真实的还是想象的。”<br><br>巴伯需要消遣。由于可用的娱乐选择很少——带有锡箔天线的雪电视、每月一本书经过——巴伯最终转向了上帝的话语。 “无聊让我拿起了《圣经》，”他写信给格雷戈里（她自己也是一个有信仰的人），“它拯救了我那毫无价值的生命。”<br><br>巴伯的圣经学习一开始很简单，读了一遍，然后再读一遍。然后，他开始一页一页地查阅圣经。巴伯说，随着时间的推移，他通过函授课程获得了 27 本书的认可证书。他告诉格雷戈里他已经把圣经读了七遍了。他说服了当时关押他的县监狱当局，允许他在 2001 年 10 月 6 日接受洗礼，他认为这一天是他的“真正的生日”。<br><br>在他的精神之旅的早期，巴伯决定他的经历将是一次彻底的转变：“我在那个肮脏、肮脏、邪恶的县监狱里向自己许下诺言，我永远不会成为‘罪犯’，”他写信给格雷戈里。 “我下定决心，当我离开监狱时，无论是步行还是装在裹尸袋里，我都会比刚到监狱时成为一个更好的人。”<br><br>巴伯检验这一信念的机会在他生命的最后一周最为明显，当时他再次有机会面对他的家人和受害者的家人。<br><br>那时，巴伯已经与格雷戈里进行了长达数年的通信，在巴伯预定处决的前一天，格雷戈里和我坐在阿拉巴马州阿特莫尔一家假日酒店的大厅里。自从 2020 年通过书面通信重新联系以来，巴伯和格雷戈里花了几个小时在电话里讨论生活，特别是格雷戈里的小儿子。现在，最后，他们剩下的大部分时间都在欢笑中度过。<br><br> “这非常超现实，”格雷戈里告诉我在探视院里的聚会。 “但他的信念非常坚定。他现在在一切事物中都拥有令人难以置信的平静。”气氛开放、亲切、热烈。巴伯“笑着继续说下去”。有一次，巴伯的家人聚集在一起拍了一张合影，当格雷戈里走到一边时，他们把她叫了进来。格雷戈里一直期待着比她发现的更悲伤的事情：一个奇怪地不怕死的人。<br><br>自从我今年早些时候见到巴伯以来，他对自己的判决态度很坚定：“我没有恐惧，”他在三月份告诉我。 “我没有。”在他去世前一周，他从阿拉巴马州的死囚牢房给我发了一封电子邮件：“我精神很好，莉兹小姐！神对我是如此信实和仁慈！许多令人难以置信的事情发生只是为了让人们知道他的存在！没有恐惧或恐惧，莉兹小姐。只是对我的主怀着虔诚的敬畏。再见，在基督里，吉米。”我们本来希望能亲自见面，但阿拉巴马州惩教署拒绝让我去见巴伯。 ADOC 还拒绝了格雷戈里的母亲、多蒂·埃普斯的女儿之一凯西·特拉普 (Kathy Trapp)，但她无论如何还是加入了。<br><br> “很少……受害者会来与杀死他们母亲的人交谈，更不用说拥抱那个杀害他们母亲的人了，”周三下午，特拉普在假日酒店坐在她女儿旁边。但这就是那天早些时候发生的事情，当时特拉普只是跟着格雷戈里进入探视院，暂时溜过了监视批准访客流入的警卫。特拉普告诉我，在他们认识到自己的错误之前，她和巴伯很快拥抱在一起。她回忆道，他当时哭了，并对她说：“我很抱歉。”特拉普很久以前就原谅了他，但这个拥抱“结束了一切，”她说。 “即使只是我进去的几分钟，”她继续说道，“我也无法真正解释它。我确实不能。但这对我来说意义重大。”<br><br>巴伯告诉另一名囚犯，他相信自己能在结束前见到特拉普，尽管 ADOC 拒绝了她的入境。在阿拉巴马州沿海夏季闷热的天气里，我坐在格雷戈里和特拉普对面，很高兴听到他的信仰得到了回报。<br><br>巴伯预定处决的<span class="smallcaps">前一天晚上</span>，他的家人与特拉普和格雷戈里一起吃晚饭。陪同他们的还有内森·“纳特”·沃特金斯（Nathan “Nat” Watkins），他是阿拉巴马州的一名律师，也是志愿者部长巴伯在入狱第一年期间结识的朋友。沃特金斯担任巴伯的精神顾问，并在第二天与巴伯一起为他生命的终结做准备。<br><br> “他周四晚上告诉我，”沃特金斯说：“‘这是我想要的一周；’”这正是我想要的。””看到他的家人与格雷戈里和特拉普在一起就是他所需要的结束。沃特金斯告诉我，一名典狱长让他们带了一把吉他，乐队演唱了保罗·西蒙和福音音乐，其中包括应一名女狱警要求演唱的《奇异恩典》。巴伯在院子里带领游行队伍唱着“当圣徒行进时”。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/alabama-death-penalty-kenneth-smith-execution/672220/">伊丽莎白·布鲁尼格：暴力史</a><br><br>最终，巴伯的所有访客都被带走了，他被单独留在死亡看守牢房里，只有一部电话可以联系他的律师，除此之外别无他法。此时，他的最后一次紧急上诉已向美国最高法院提出，他只能等待最高法院的裁决来决定他的命运。整个晚上，我和巴伯的律师之一玛拉·克莱巴纳 (Mara Klebaner) 以及巴伯的前律师约翰·加洛 (John Gallo) 一起在酒店大堂闲逛，时间是下午 6 点，也就是他的处决时间。晚上七点变成了八点，八点接近九点，然后是十点。大约在那个时候，格雷戈里给我发短信，问我我们的情况如何。 “只是紧张，”我说，然后回答了这个问题。 “紧张又踱步，”她回答道。<br><br>我们等待的时候，巴伯一直和他的另一位律师通电话，随着时间的流逝，律师与他交谈，最后，给他读圣经，直到他睡着。我很惊讶巴伯居然还能睡着，因为他知道他随时都可能被警卫叫醒，然后被带到轮床上被杀，但巴伯显然比我预想的更自在。<br><br>我也没有预料到受害者家属会多么害怕被处决。但格雷戈里前一天告诉我，她“明天就会失去一个朋友……我从来没想过我会这么说。他是我的朋友，我会想念他的。”这在很大程度上证明了巴伯自己的忏悔，他全身心投入格雷戈里的宽恕，并从他所打破的残余中建立了联系。如果一个人很大程度上是他所有关系的综合体，而巴伯因最初的罪行而毁掉了自己，那么他似乎以某种方式重塑了自己，主要是依靠他的信仰力量。也许这就是为什么他对死亡显得那么平静；他已经经历过奇迹了，根本不用怀疑人是否可以重生。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">资本惩罚</span>与赎回无关。 7月21日午夜后约10分钟，最高法院裁定巴伯的处决可以继续进行。半个多小时后，克莱巴纳、加洛和我乘坐一辆囚车前往阿拉巴马州执行死刑的威廉·C·霍尔曼惩教所。进去后，我们被引导通过金属探测器，拖着脚步进入与行刑室相连的证人室：一个小煤渣块区域，几排椅子上闪烁着衰弱的荧光灯，所有椅子都面向窗户，窗帘拉在窗户对面。里面。从里面，由于玻璃的遮挡，我们可以听到巴伯与行刑室的其他人交谈。不管他说什么，都让他们笑了。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/joe-nathan-james-execution-alabama/671127/">伊丽莎白·布鲁尼格：为权利而死</a><br><br>终于有人把帘子拉到一边。巴伯裹着白色床单，绑在轮床上，看上去温和而平静。沃特金斯站在他对面的小房间里。当霍尔曼的一名看守特里·雷邦（Terry Raybon）向巴伯提供分享他的遗言的机会时，巴伯指出他无法将纸张带入房间进行宣读。如果巴伯被允许读出他想要说的话，他会说：<br><br><p>上帝真是太好了！我的生命结束了。我所爱的人的生命结束了。我被关进监狱，没有保释，没有任何机会。在深渊的边缘。一切都转眼就过去了。但是……我打开了一本圣经。神俯下身子，将我举在他的手中，说道：“现在，你已经准备好供我使用，作为我荣耀的工具了。”！！！ ……</p><p>神是万物的创造者。他在我身上创造了一个新事物。给了我从未有过的智慧，并保证我在他面前有一个永久的居所！我努力通过我的生活方式向他表达我的爱和对他所赐予的伟大礼物的敬畏。有时，我知道我没能尽力而为。但我很早就下定决心，对于发生在我手中的事情，仅用言语无法表达我的悲伤。因此，我希望我的生活方式能够向多萝西·埃普斯的家人以及我的家人证明我对自己所做的事情感到遗憾和羞耻。我不知道我是否成功了。这不由我来评判。但我也在县监狱的电话里告诉我的兄弟，我永远不会成为一名罪犯。说我不会把头发剪得像人一样，行为举止也像人一样。当我走出监狱或被装在裹尸袋中抬出时，我希望成为一个比走进监狱时更好的人。</p><p>我希望上帝认为我的努力是值得的。我希望埃普斯家人知道我做了唯一一件我认为可以表达我深深的遗憾的事情，这在某种程度上对他们有帮助。请为埃普斯一家祈祷。我深深地爱着他们。为我的家人祈祷，祈求平安和力量。</p><p>愿创造万物的上帝为你们每个人创造一个新事物，并带领你们进入你们生命中最伟大、最灵性的时代。</p><p>成为他荣耀的工具！我爱你并在基督里感谢你。</p>躺在那里，巴伯<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/alabama-death-penalty-lethal-injection-50a202c6c71dd7ea269c722b9c5afe0a">记得</a>原谅了阿拉巴马州州长凯·艾维“以及这个房间里的人……因为你即将要做的事情。”<br><br>沃特金斯走上前，碰触巴伯的脚，默默祈祷。巴伯看着他，说他已经准备好了。然后药物开始通过静脉输液管从室壁后面看不见的区域流入他的手中，巴伯闭上了眼睛。凌晨两点左右，活动结束了。<br><br>我在黎明前的黑暗中离开了阿拉巴马州，几乎是在监狱官员将我们送回 ADOC 用作目击者集合点的赌场酒店之后。自去年连续三起拙劣的处决以来，国家终于满足了囚犯及其律师的要求：一次不起眼的司法处决。巴伯已经为他的罪行赎罪了。这两件事似乎只有微弱的、对立的联系，这使得巴伯所取得的成就对我来说更加重要。不管阿拉巴马州的状况如何，也不管他在 2001 年那个晚上做了什么，他死得很好。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate>

Novak）（最出名的角色是<i>《办公室》</i>中狡猾的临时工瑞安）在<i>《大卫莱特曼深夜秀》</i>中承认自己 17 年前在美国极右翼历史上扮演过一个小角色。这个角色的重要性在当时并不明显，无论是对诺瓦克（当时正在上高中）还是对它的受害者——波士顿美术博物馆困惑的顾客来说。诺瓦克找了一位声音低沉的罗马尼亚同学，一起为《龙之国记：中国绘画千年》展览<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.boston.com/uncategorized/noprimarytagmatch/2011/11/23/b-j-novak-confesses-to-mfa-prank/">录制了语音导览</a>。在朋友的帮助下，他们将包含<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tenderbutton.com/bmfa/bmfa.mp3">这次旅行的</a>磁带放入博物馆的官方语音导览中。<br><br>艺术爱好者一定想知道在中国弦乐器的演奏声中迎接他们的浓重东欧口音。这位罗马尼亚人很快就变得固执己见（“就我个人而言，”他说，“我认为这幅画是一堆垃圾”），然后变得精神错乱。他提到了他“令人厌恶的解剖异常”。他称听众为“颓废的帝国主义蛆虫”，并承认自己想用大锤砸碎玻璃柜，并“用我的牙齿把卷轴撕成碎片，顺便说一句，我的牙齿非常长而且锋利……更像是獠牙，而不是獠牙”。人类的牙齿。”最后，他在摸索剧本的同时，插入了一段“白痴音乐”。 “这会让你忙起来的，你这个流口水的白痴！”他对着听众吼叫，听众们要么被逗乐了，要么在向管理层抱怨。最后几分钟是蒂托·普恩特 (Tito Puente) 的恰恰表演。<br><br>让诺瓦克退出美国法西斯主义的舞台。 （他最后一次为人所知的政治捐款是 2016 年向希拉里·克林顿捐赠 1,000 美元。）但这位罗马尼亚人一直保持着自己的性格，脾气暴躁，口音也很重。大约在诺瓦克上<i>《莱特曼》</i>的时候，这位罗马尼亚人开始在社交媒体上发帖称自己为“青铜时代变态者”，一个疯狂的怪人，他逃离了美术博物馆，现在的目标是统治世界。他通过推文、播客和自行出版的书传达的信息，融合了极右翼政治、毫不掩饰的种族主义和对古希腊的深入了解。他从未露面，也从未承认过自己的真名。但我认识青铜时代变态者，认识他的时间几乎和 BJ 诺瓦克一样长。他是麻省理工学院的毕业生，在马萨诸塞州牛顿长大。他的名字叫科斯汀·阿拉马留。<br><br>很难准确地表达 BAP 的信念，部分原因是他的观点非常古怪，即使简单表述，听起来也像是语无伦次的咆哮。美国的公民宗教认为，所有人类都有与生俱来的平等价值，不应该根据美丽或高贵来对他们进行分级，也不应该以互相毁灭为目标。 BAP 表示这种正统观念是完全错误的。他认为，生命的自然和理想状态是强者和高贵者对弱者和丑陋者的统治。他认为美国城市是犹太人和黑人经营的“荒地”，尽管他用来指代这些群体的词远没有这些人那么文雅。<br><br>他说，现代国家的设计目的是为了赋予那些弱者和畸形者权力，而牺牲他们的优秀者的利益。强者和高贵者必须羞辱和征服折磨他们的人并摧毁他们的机构。 BAP 在拥有超过 100,000 名粉丝的 Twitter 上发布了半裸雅利安牛肉饼的图片，通常是在热带环境中，以庆祝该种族的战士元素的完美身体，他希望有一天能够恢复统治地位。<br><br>世界，或者至少是世界的一部分，对 BAP 的接受度比人们想象的要高。到目前为止，他是法西斯右翼的一位领先的文化人物——无论是精英人士还是非精英人士，他们都认同他的政治哲学，而非精英人士则热爱他的活力并渴望他的博学多才。<br><br>我认为自己是才华横溢的疯子的鉴赏家，如果他们的疯狂具有幽默或独创性等补偿性美德，我对他们的疯狂有很高的容忍度。但即使是我也觉得 BAP 令人担忧。一开始的喜剧可能会变得更加险恶——BAP 的小伎俩虽然有时很搞笑，但却显示出转变为一种新的极右激进主义模式的迹象，而粉丝们则处于责任和权力的位置。<br><br>通常，即使哲学家最亲密的朋友和家人也不会阅读哲学书籍。但 BAP 的书《<i>青铜时代的心态》</i> （2018 年）却以不可忽视的方式轰然世界，一度跻身整个亚马逊目录中的前 150 本书。 “这仍然是一本邪典书，”一位前特朗普白宫官员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/23/alt-right-book-trump-1472413">在 2019 年告诉<i>Politico</i></a> 。 “如果你是一个年轻人，聪明，在某种程度上靠近右边，那么你很可能听说过它。”他的播客《<i>加勒比节奏》</i>同样赢得了狂热的追随者。<br><br>只有最粗心的人才会承认他们的忠诚。 BAP 告诉他的年轻门徒深入政府，公开否认他，等待。恐怖主义、极端主义和反恐中心的马修·克莱纳（Matthew Kriner）负责监控试图引发种族战争和复兴法西斯运动的团体的社交媒体活动。他们的账户中有一些毫不隐晦的日耳曼名字，比如 Atomwaffen。 “他们中的绝大多数人都是青铜时代的变态，”克莱纳告诉我。此外，他有一种奇怪的跨界吸引力——无论是在网络上极度格格不入的人中，还是在现实世界中具有影响力的人物中。 Kriner 表示，BAP“代表了一座桥梁，可以让您在非常合理的时间内从真正不可接受的内容转向可能最终参与某人的立法活动。”<br><br> BAP 与唐纳德·特朗普的关系一直很奇怪。他一再以荷马史诗般的绰号称呼这位前总统，称其为“罗宋汤带”喜剧演员、“尤克大师”。对于 BAP 来说，特朗普的主要美德是破坏。他深情地认为这位前总统是一个同类的侮辱喜剧，公然不敬，在种族和移民问题上总体上是正确的。这种感情得到了前特朗普政府国家安全官员迈克尔·安东 (Michael Anton) 的印刷回报，他在 2019 年<i>《克莱蒙特书评》</i>上发表了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/are-the-kids-altright/">一篇同情 BAP 的文章</a>，同时指出他有“种族主义”、“反犹太主义”倾向。 ”“反民主”、“厌恶女性”和“恐同”。安东建议（我认为正确）BAP 的恶毒言论，无论真诚与否，都有一个目的：让爱发牢骚的左派忙于记录他的琐碎思想罪行，而忽视他更严重的异端邪说。与此同时，那些能够在不被愤怒蒙蔽的情况下阅读他的人会悄悄地向他学习，并听取他关于联系、网络和情节的建议。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/us-extremism-portland-george-floyd-protests-january-6/673088/">摘自2023年4月号：美国可怕的极端主义暴力循环</a><br><br>安东写道，BAP“直接表达了年轻人（尤其是白人男性）对当今时代所宣传和强加的平等的不满：一种威吓、报复、怨恨、平等、虚伪的平等，它惩罚优秀并公开否认所有差异，同时时间让腐朽、无能、腐败的精英们得到提升和致富。”安东曾是政治哲学研究生，他在文章的结尾预言了 BAPist 的未来：“在争夺右翼不满青年的心灵和思想的精神战争中，保守主义正在失败。 BAPism 正在获胜。”<br><br><span class="smallcaps">尽管 BAP 主义</span>强调身体的完美，但它最初是一种知识分子现象，它的第一个胜利来自知识界。它们是如此狡猾，以至于连这些圈子的守护者也只能在敌人进入大门后才认出他们。<br><br>去年，在密歇根州立大学的一次政治哲学家会议上，耶鲁大学教授布莱恩·加斯顿 (Bryan Garsten) 告诉他的同事，他们遇到了麻烦。会议的主题是自由主义——不是特德·肯尼迪的自由主义，而是早于现代民主党乃至美国本身的古典版本。自由主义认为个人拥有权利和信仰，政治涉及维护权利并在信仰发生冲突时做出妥协。它只存在了几个世纪，从某些方面来看，它是历史上最成功的想法。只要看看人们想要居住的地方：美国、欧盟、加拿大、澳大利亚和英国，这些都是人们愿意冒着生命危险去到达的自由主义国家。<br><br>但<a data-event-element="inline link"

“你的学生需要成为更好的读者，”马里兰州洛约拉大学政治学教授戴安娜·J·绍布 (Diana J.

He humbly suggested that if petitions did not topple Hosni Mubarak, a well-attended candlelight vigil might. Yale&#39;s grad students attempted to unionize and to pressure the university to increase stipends and benefits. One wrote to a grad-student listserv with questions about the school&#39;s dental-insurance coverage. “My cousin Benko run Benko-Magnitogorsk Dental Emporium, he make good dental work in white van at Grand Av. and East St. in parking lot outside plumbing supplies store,” Costin replied. “You forward me small price of $100 he do work … steel teeth, gold teeth anything you want.” The email was an early exercise in refitting his character to needle and ridicule liberals.<br><br> His dissertation is a peculiar document. His adviser, Steven B. Smith, is often identified with the German-born Jewish philosopher Leo Strauss, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25alter.html">about whom Smith wrote an elegant book</a> . Strauss argued that great thinkers have embedded hidden messages in their writing, and the apparent meaning of their books and essays often contradicts the recondite meaning that only discerning readers can decode. The upshot: Read carefully, because things are not what they seem.<br><br> Costin&#39;s dissertation follows Smith&#39;s and Strauss&#39;s lead. It is eccentric even within this eccentric tradition, as Costin himself allows. He reads Plato in a Straussian style: Plato&#39;s teacher, Socrates, was executed for doing philosophy in a manner vexing to the Athenian state, so naturally Plato would have learned from that experience and written so that only the most perceptive reader could discern his true, subversive beliefs. At least one of those beliefs, in Costin&#39;s reading, is a doozy. Plato, taken by most readers to scorn tyrants, is read by Costin as their covert defender. “Philosophy and tyranny are fundamentally connected,” Costin writes, and their shared aim is eugenic. They seek “the breeding,” the “biological” production of genius, nobility, and virtue: a master race.<br><br> “There is much in this view that is frightening and even abhorrent to us,” Costin writes. Yet he states that Plato&#39;s claims are validated by the history of human cultures. For evidence, he offers a bizarre mix of folklore, history, and ethnography. The development of an aristocratic class, he says, demands conquest, the vanquishing of lesser races by the organized violence of the greater. As an example, he quotes Pierre van den Berghe, an anthropologist who described Rwandan Tutsis, an archetypal aristocratic elite, as “intelligent, astute in political intrigue, born to command, refined, courageous, and cruel.” His dissertation is dripping with admiration for these martial, masculine virtues, and for their feminine counterpart of beauty. He despises, in turn, farming and manual labor, the characteristics of a slave class.<br><br> One of the best ways to conceal your genocidal fascism is to write about it openly in that most unread of documents, the unpublished doctoral dissertation. The few who noticed considered it an intellectual exercise rather than an act of incipient fascism.<br><br> Costin&#39;s advisers were not alone in failing to take his Nietzscheanism as seriously as they might have. Dustin Sebell, a former acquaintance of Costin&#39;s from that period and now a professor at Michigan State, told me that political philosophy as a whole has been one big victory parade for liberalism for several decades now. “You have a tradition of reflection that has gone on for decades largely oblivious to these radical Nietzschean critiques,” Sebell said. “When those critiques resurfaced, many professional philosophers had little to say for themselves.”<br><br> When Costin began submitting his doctoral work, Smith, his adviser, became enraged. “I was shocked that his family would escape Ceaușescu&#39;s Romania only for Costin to undermine the principles of [American] democracy,” Smith told me. “I view that as a shameful act of betrayal.” He said he made his disgust known but ultimately signed off, and Costin received his degree. “I was his dissertation adviser, not his censor.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In 2015, Emory University</span> hired Costin for a postdoctoral fellowship, on the basis of less incendiary writing samples. His time there was a disaster. He acted erratically. At one point, he refused to give Emory&#39;s human-resources department his home address. During the spring semester, the university discovered that Costin had secretly stopped teaching his classes in person and was instead attempting to teach them over email. Further investigation revealed that Costin was medically unable to teach in person, with a vague but apparently real physical infirmity. His fellowship was not renewed. Later he lived for some time in Brazil, although he has been sighted recently in Japan, Spain, Hong Kong, and Iceland.<br><br> Within two years of his departure from Emory, <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> was published—a noxious, digressive summa that incorporated the conclusions in his dissertation, and added many others too outré for any but a self-published document. It is a narcissistic, 198-page love letter to himself, or to the philosopher-as-muscleman that his BAP persona purports to be. The tone approaches at times the onanistic genius of a young Norman Mailer, but much more resentful toward the modern world. “Perversions—lame ones—are born by the thousands and haunt, like myriad cripplette midgets in halls of mirrors, they haunt the world, books, the internet. Minds are lost. If you wait any longer everything will be pounded to garbage, there will be nothing left—it will all turn, the whole world will turn to a Bulgarian rest stop lavatory,” he writes. “I declare to you, with great boldness, that I am here to save you from a great ugliness.”<br><br> The “Bronze Age” element of his perversion refers to the earliest days of ancient Greece—an era of virile pagan militarism.<br><br> The “great ugliness” is the liberal bureaucratic state. Democracy, he writes, destroys “personal freedom and initiative” by elevating an unworthy caste of subhuman creatures he calls “bugmen,” who flourish only under these debased conditions, like roaches in a pit latrine. On his podcast, BAP praises the philosopher James Burnham, who wrote that the heroic age of capitalism had passed, and that a “managerial revolution” had elevated to power bean counters and bureaucrats (think of his supposed persecutors from Emory&#39;s HR department) over noble intellects and creators. Any person of talent or intelligence is ground down by this system, by “life under the thumb of the empowered old matriarchs and the conceptual dildoes they use to clobber the heads of young men.”<br><br> The ugliness extends to art and culture. Low dominates high. Screeching popular music drowns out Rachmaninoff. “From the point of view of real culture and refinement we&#39;re as barbaric as the most obscure herd of the Khwarezm [an ancient Central Asian people] where the women scratch their pubes in public.”<br><br> The “Bronze Age” element of his perversion refers to the earliest days of ancient Greece—an era of virile pagan militarism, before the moderns, and even some of the ancients, were beguiled into weakness. Men performed feats of intellect and strength unknown today: memorization of names and poetry, running flat-out for miles under heavy armor to impale enemies. These men prospered under “life at its peak,” which happens “not in the grass hut village ruled by nutso mammies, but in the military state.”<br><br> Then things get weird. BAP fantasizes about a near-apocalyptic cleansing:<br><br> Here is my vision of the true justice, the justice of nature: the zoos opened, predators unleashed by the dozens, hundreds … four thousand hungry wolves rampaging on streets of these hive cities, elephants and bison stampeding, the buildings smashed to pieces, the cries of the human bug shearing through the streets as the lord of beasts returns. Manhattan, Moscow, Peking reduced to ruins overgrown by vines and forest, the haunt of the lynx and coyote again. The great cesspool slums, Calcutta, Nairobi, all the fetid latrines of the world covered over by mudslides, overgrown with thick jungle, this is justice. The beings fit to rule this rewilded landscape are the neo-warriors, men of greatness and violence. “The only right government is military government, and every other form is both hypocritical and destructive of true freedom,” BAP writes. He considers Japan during the late imperial period, when the emperor was a martial god, an ideal political arrangement, and has written elsewhere that it is “the perfect model of national political life and national identity.”<br><br> BAP styles his book an “exhortation,” and ultimately he exhorts white people to form military units with deep masculine bonds, and together annihilate lesser races or throw them under the yoke. One could more easily dismiss BAP as a political shock jock, and his racism as cheap and tasteless subversion, if this section were not so obviously heartfelt. He mentions by name the white mercenaries who toppled governments for profit and pleasure in the 20th century. “The coming age of barbarism will not be owned, as so many of you urban cucks fear, by the gangbangers and the unwashed hordes of the teeming cesspools of the world, but by clean-cut middle-class and working-class vets, men of military experience, who know something about how to shoot and how to organize. The fools who think oligarchs will be able to control these men for very long should look to the fortunes of the Sforzas”—the Renaissance clan that controlled, then lost, the duchy of Milan—“and many others, and remember that money is no match for force of arms combined with charm.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">I asked Vish Burra,</span> the young Hill staffer, how BAP had charmed him. “The power, the vitality, the energy,” he said. “The left has stuck itself in a position of promoting a politics of sterility.” He said he didn&#39;t agree with everything BAP said, but he loved the vision, the verve, the relentless mockery of the bugmen.<br><br> The bugmen, as Burra suggests, are terrible at countering BAP&#39;s message. Liberals and leftists are used to sitting in a blind, watching for telltale signs of their enemies&#39; racism. There is no point in yelling “racist” at someone who is already yelling racial epithets at full volume. And there is, among BAP&#39;s fans, perverse pleasure in watching their critics passionately denounce their hero, to no discernible effect.<br><br> BAPists are not supposed to talk about being BAPists, and they even have a term of abuse for those who do: <i>facefag</i> . “He wouldn&#39;t appreciate a face—” Rather than utter the word, Burra sort of gestured at it, pawing the air. “He wouldn&#39;t appreciate a guy like me, but I&#39;m a big fan.”<br><br> BAP enjoys suggesting how close his followers are to the control panels. He posts pictures of their copies of <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> next to tokens of their power, such as US-government-official passports and patches, IDs, and other items from the livery of the Secret Service, Army Rangers, Department of Homeland Security, and Air Force. He allows one to wonder whether for every Vish Burra, who proudly keeps his copy of the book on the office shelf, there are others who adopt bugman camouflage. To be part of a clandestine movement, so extreme that it feels almost invisible to one&#39;s elders, is part of the thrill. “I mentioned him in class the other day; my students were shocked that I knew who Bronze Age Pervert was,” the Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen said at a conference in April.<br><br> A BAPist can take pleasure in having entered an exclusive cognitive club. One of his supporters wrote to me that BAP&#39;s character was layered with irony, and that the ability to see the truth in BAP, and separate it from the hilarious megalomania, is a kind of Straussian test, to determine who can read and think, and who is so offended by the racism, misogyny, and anti-Semitism that he is incapacitated and unable to focus on anything else, even to criticize it. “Nobody who has the IQ to listen to one hour of BAP without tuning out actually believes he recommends becoming an autistic nudist bodybuilder.”<br><br> I am not sure I pass that test. Listening to BAP, one gets the impression of florid insanity. He digresses as if not in control of his own thoughts. He barks insults and orders at subordinates in his recording studio, and one can reasonably wonder whether these figures are comic creations or psychotic delusions. He cannot possibly believe everything he says he believes.<br><br> BAP glorifies bodybuilding and devotes much of his Twitter feed to images of half-naked white hunks in the flower of youth. Allegedly this is to worship their vitality, their fitness for the aristocratic warrior class that the modern world has dishonored. He stresses that in ancient Athens, the cultivation of physical perfection was a privilege of the elite. Only citizens could train in the gymnasium. The process of creating an ideal male form was deemed beyond the station of lesser entities, such as women and slaves.<br><br> The parade of Adonises has led many to question BAP&#39;s sexuality. Bizarrely, Costin is not the only fascist I know who has been dogged by such rumors. Richard Spencer, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/his-kampf/524505/">my chemistry-lab partner in middle school</a> , faced persistent questions about his sexuality when he was a leader of the alt‑right. (If anyone out there can explain why homoerotic fascists keep seeking my company, please let me know.) Spencer told me, more than a little exasperated, that he thought the case for BAP&#39;s homosexuality had been proved. “If I had posted even one photo of some guy&#39;s ass on Twitter, do you think there would be any question in anyone&#39;s mind?” In <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> , BAP writes that the confusion of masculine bonding for homosexuality “is misunderstanding and exaggeration promoted by the homonerds of our time,” a poverty of our imagination and lack of friendship, “because we can&#39;t conceive of such intense love between friends without some carnal or material benefit in play.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/his-kampf/524505/">From the June 2017 issue: How Richard Spencer became an icon for white supremacists</a><br><br> The sheer length of time BAP has held his pose makes one wonder whether more of it is sincere than his followers think. As a character sings in a Sam Shepard play, “I believe in my mask: The man I made up is me.” The breeding of a caste of supermen is not just a pseudo-comic reverie. It is the subject of his dissertation. The fantasies of killing “lower forms of life” are not funny at all, not even as a lampoon of liberal excess. And while some people know BAP personally, and vouch for his intelligence and wit, few have emerged to state with confidence that he&#39;s not a fascist and racist. That is because he probably is one.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">What might it</span> feel like to experience the modern world as a “great ugliness”—an inverted kingdom of sniveling ass-kissers? “Society became something approaching mass concentration camp,” BAP has said on his podcast. “I&#39;m exaggerating only a little.” His rejection of this world is matched by his rejection by it. His classmates are successful; they hold good jobs. One by one, the adolescent Nietzscheans grew up into productive citizens, and put aside childish fascinations. The person who introduced us, now decades ago, was once so close to Costin that their friends described them as sharing something almost as deep as marriage. (They did not suggest the bond was erotic.) That friend has excelled in a normal life: a job at a tech company, a family, leadership in his synagogue. At some point he chose to be normal, which means rejecting BAP.<br><br> Liberalism&#39;s victory had been so overwhelming that for generations it grew soft, unaccustomed to the hard work of defending itself. Now a ranting nudist poses a real danger.<br><br> To take a job, to toil in the modern fields among the bugs and bugmen, is the greatest betrayal. No one respectable wants anything to do with someone who tweets out messages calling for “high violence” against the “kike and nigger” scourge.<br><br> BAP has responded to this rejection with bitterness, with what Milton called “a sense of injured merit.” I find his message melancholic. Recently he posted a video of himself in Rio de Janeiro&#39;s Botanical Garden, following around a wild bird. “Yes, hello,” he says. “Do not run from me. Come back. I love you.” I do not see much space for true love in the world he has built for himself, whose components are war, purification, and mutual masculine admiration ever fearful of its eros.<br><br> Fixation on BAP&#39;s monstrous qualities has, I think, led even his fervent admirers to overlook the most unexpected aspect of his philosophy, which is a literal belief in the transmigration of souls, as described in Eastern religions and the work of Arthur Schopenhauer. If this life fails, another will come. When the ironic pose drops, when the outrageous Boratism subsides, this conviction is what remains. “I believe reincarnation is fundamentally true,” he writes, in a section of his book that does not appear to be for laughs.<br><br> “I think that is the deepest layer of his outlook,” Dustin Sebell, at Michigan State, told me. “He believes in an esoteric version of metempsychosis, that our truest selves live on after death and take on different forms. He is profoundly unwilling to accept his own mortality.”<br><br> No humans receive praise higher than what BAP lavishes on noble animals like jaguars and birds of prey. He is taken, however, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201124-yukio-mishima-the-strange-tale-of-japans-infamous-novelist">the diminutive Japanese writer Yukio Mishima</a> . In midlife, Mishima took up bodybuilding and raised a squad of erotically intertwined neo-samurai warriors. When it became clear that Japan&#39;s managerial revolution had extinguished its imperial spirit, he attempted to overthrow the Japanese government and restore the power of the emperor. After that failed, he ritually disemboweled himself.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In Michigan,</span> when<span class="smallcaps"> </span>Bryan Garsten made his comment about the seductions of illiberalism, BAP was like the ghost at the banquet, cackling from the rafters at his professor&#39;s consternation. But the remarks went on longer, and they were also searching, and self-critical. Garsten told his listeners that they—he—may have failed to cultivate students&#39; imagination. His illiberal students, Garsten said, had learned why the Greeks admired Achilles, the fiery warrior. But they neglected the Greeks&#39; admiration for Ulysses, a subtler and greater model of manhood. Ulysses&#39;s greatness emerged not from his rejection of this world, but from his mastery of its constraints. He owed myriad debts to those around him: to his men, to his son, to his wife.<br><br> The students romanticized the tyrant, while assuming that liberalism bred sloth and laziness. “Life in a liberal democracy is full of demanding moments,” Garsten said at the conference. I had the impression that he was addressing BAP apostrophically, delivering a warning he wished he had delivered in person. “As far as I have read, life under tyrants is full of lassitude, selfishness, duplicity, betrayal.”<br><br> One could feel, over the course of these discussions, the stirrings of dormant liberal passions—as if the mere invocation of BAPism, after many years ignored, had inspired a counteroffensive. Another political theorist, a former Marine and a Brookings Institution scholar named William A. Galston, piped up to remind everyone that when liberalism had come under mortal threat in the Pacific theater, “Americans as a whole found it in themselves to do something.” Specifically, his fellow Marines charged, shot, and bayoneted their way from island to island until illiberalism, in the form of Japanese fascism, begged them for mercy. “Is there really an opposition between the open society and the virtue of courage?” Galston asked.<br><br> The defeat of imperial Japan illustrated the point nicely, I thought. But it also raised a much stranger question, about how liberals acquired such a reputation for sissydom in the first place. The Battle of Iwo Jima wasn&#39;t that long ago. But in certain spaces—academia, elite journalism—liberalism&#39;s victory had been so overwhelming that for generations it grew soft, flabby, and unaccustomed to the hard work of defending itself from a vigorous challenger. As such challengers left universities and newspapers, those institutions became self-congratulatory monocultures, inhospitable even to conservatives far less nutty than BAP. By now, a ranting nudist poses a real danger—of poisoning politics, splitting apart societies, and persuading otherwise talented people to spurn the modern world&#39;s greatest achievements, which are peace, tolerance, and prosperity.<br><br> The great Straussian Allan Bloom predicted doom for liberalism when these challenges disappeared. “The most essential of our freedoms, as men and as liberal democrats, the freedom of our minds, consists in the consciousness of the fundamental alternatives,” he wrote. An unchallenged liberal democrat, he argued, ceases to want to improve, unless he confronts his enemies in their most potent forms. Those forms will shock and humble us, he wrote, and have “the added salutary effect of destroying our sense of our own worth and giving us higher aspirations.”<br><br> To Costin personally, I have never been more grateful. His last message came during the pandemic. I asked how things were looking in Brazil. “Not bad,” he reported, with laconic caginess. He had not yet veered, as he later did in his public statements about COVID-19, into outright conspiracy theory and extended roasts of Anthony Fauci. Since then, I have come to think of BAP&#39;s performances in immunological terms: a gnarly virus that had lain dormant for decades in circles of philosophers and their unread books. Now that it&#39;s loose in the human population, it is a vicious kick to the liberal immune system. And that is not entirely bad.

The green light illuminates one second <i>before</i> the operator presses the button. No one can outwit it, because it works by reading the operator&#39;s predetermined behaviors before they&#39;re apparent to the operator themselves.<br><br> At first, people goof around with the device as a simple amusement. But in time, its effects on many users clearly become serious, because they realize from playing with it that free will is an illusion. As a result, a third of the population develops a pathology known as “akinetic mutism,” a kind of walking coma in which all motivation is absent from life. Some are hospitalized because they won&#39;t feed themselves. Without free will, it seems, people do not feel they are truly alive.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/generative-ai-future-training-models/674478/">Read: AI is an existential threat to itself</a><br><br> That account is fiction, but we are living in a time when science and philosophy present fresh challenges to the existence of free will. Just as Chiang&#39;s story suggests, this has profound implications for happiness. Understanding the arguments at play, and deciding how to respond, can make a big difference in your life.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he question of</span> free will arises from what philosophers call the “mind-body problem,” which asks whether the mind and the brain are the same thing or separate entities. The philosopher René Descartes famously wrestled with this conundrum in his 1641 <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i> , arguing that the mind occupies no physical space and is thus distinct from the body.<br><br> This “dualist” view has had many modern adherents, both religious and secular. For example, the Australian philosopher David Chalmers believes that the mind is not physical or material; he posits that one <i>could</i> exist physically without consciousness, like a zombie, so consciousness must exist outside the material realm.<br><br> If this is true, where does the mind reside, if not in the brain? Some might say that the mind is in the soul—or is the soul itself—which, if not physical, might exist beyond physical death. Others point to a kind of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://iep.utm.edu/panpsych/#:~:text=Panpsychism%20is%20the%20view%20that,psyche%20(soul%20or%20mind).">panpsychism</a> , or a degree of consciousness that inhabits all natural bodies. But whatever the mind is and wherever it resides, we seem to possess an essence that enables us to make <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763419300739?casa_token=QFM2udG0V5EAAAAA:KE-u5v8ZxU4vXbpNikvV30-2e8ohJ4rJ1kiN4RDtSy5vJGBq3BcisF7hu4sXQ7spSJH5Tgo4">decisions</a> in our daily lives, an expression of independent choice, of free will. A useful metaphor for this view is that the brain is the computer and the mind is the operator.<br><br> In contrast to all of this, a school of “physicalists” believes that subjective experiences and consciousness emanate entirely from the brain, and that the separateness of brain and mind is an illusion. To revert to the metaphor, no external operator exists.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C. Brooks?

But this isn&#39;t proof that the mind doesn&#39;t exist. After all, we believe that the universe is a purely physical phenomenon as well, even if we still do not fully understand it. To say that the mind is separate from the brain simply because the connections are unknown, the logic goes, doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br> This logic also explains why so many physicalists reject the concept of free will. As the Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9pqdKP9tuk">puts it</a> , “What we call &#39;free will&#39; is simply the biology that we haven&#39;t understood well enough yet.” Furthermore, these thinkers cite evidence that many of what we consider to be voluntary actions are initiated before we are even aware of them. After all, our brains contain about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/new-field-neuroscience-aims-map-connections-brain">86 billion neurons</a> , with an estimated 100 trillion links among them. The activity and connections are—pun intended—mind-bogglingly complex, far beyond the conscious control of your lumbering will. By the time you decide to eat that cookie, your brain has already initiated the action to do so.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/how-sleep-deprivation-decays-the-mind-and-body/282395/">Read: How sleep deprivation decays the mind and body</a><br><br> A hybrid argument for free will does exist, one that acknowledges both the complexity of the brain and the fact that we might not make every individual decision freely. It suggests that decisions influencing the patterns of everyday life might run automatically. So you may not, in any meaningful sense, <i>choose</i> a certain route to work every day, but you did freely choose to take a job in Tucson instead of Tacoma, limiting your overall range of commuting possibilities. More seriously, you might make moral commitments based on careful consideration, but that in turn constrains your subsequent behavioral choices, which you make automatically.<br><br> W <span class="smallcaps">e aren&#39;t going to</span> sort out the puzzle of free will here. I have my hunches about all of the theories, and you have yours, but they are just that. The question at hand is how best, allowing for this uncertainty, to act to improve your happiness. The answer, doubts notwithstanding, is to embrace the idea of your own free will over your actions and life. This is a pragmatic strategy, similar to Blaise Pascal&#39;s famous <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/">wager</a> about belief in God: You should believe, because if you are wrong, you lose little, but if you are right (and live accordingly), you have a huge amount to gain.<br><br> Social scientists have demonstrated that a belief in free will is associated with life satisfaction, as studies have shown among <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886922001210?casa_token=a9Bue08pL9QAAAAA:J39CRbQHHBh1Ypd2YLiLhvoghV3dH7TFhTtCbFVeGN7HkB4ROfDCP28wOzk--RxcGxqhiNbP">adolescents</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1948550609351600?casa_token=qAIM1G6HVusAAAAA:qsSDTydIURvpUt1dENjee_q1-Ydk6r1ZVqsTiue5eHXNn8XYevWagoUT2jEx-M1mZcyacLKPJHxnww">adults</a> .

Furthermore, this belief can affect anyone, because people whose belief in free will was found to be weaker in research studies tended to score higher than others in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167208327217?casa_token=hwirSctQpiAAAAAA:rcjxk9qfCZ21sxT-tUztGyCiZF2dCNOEvjA_Id0kqnd96pkXnAlGz8mBIN2zPTPdpYYYmGHJtHZA8A">aggression</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103112001825?casa_token=-5AUW0kHduAAAAAA:5N87zBgSW-CTktQc5RWUs5uuOR9ThLmRfaZyVHuhm5uzz9wBv15ea6DanmpWr0_jyfqcaOFIUGU">social conformity</a> , and have lower <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012001171?casa_token=mfscj-N2wrUAAAAA:NkANiMuP02lubO2EyrnmdNrFW2N5_tkrPaP3NbUbhWwv0pXtoK86A-rpSx1xrfY1d3T7Ml6MifE">self-control</a> .<br><br> Regardless of their underlying beliefs, when people are simply exposed to statements about free will, that influences their attitudes toward life. In an experiment written up in the journal <i>Philosophical Psychology</i> in 2016, scholars asked participants to read either statements affirming free will, such as “I have feelings of regret when I make bad decisions because I know that ultimately I am responsible for my actions,” or statements denying free will, such as “All behavior is determined by brain activity, which in turn is determined by a combination of environmental and genetic factors.” The researchers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09515089.2014.996285?casa_token=ZVRPiqp8fg8AAAAA%3AvIiDNbNdte0qNV9_5tFx3t3OEiHB8mmJiISGwVGNqh3_nVEXoB06ajZOD7zUB-pJyrlfQ2yqg9QNbA">found</a> that after reading the pro-free-will statements, people set more meaning-filled goals for themselves. After reading the anti-free-will statements, the participants in a parallel study perceived less meaning in their lives.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/05/financial-biological-determinism/239527/">Read: financial biological determinism</a><br><br> If you are a firm believer in free will, well … lucky you. You can try affirming this belief as you start each day by telling yourself, “This is a day of choices—to love or to hate, to give or to take, to move forward or backward in my life. I will make the better choice whenever I can.” When you feel upset or angry, remember that your feelings may happen to you, but that you can manage your reactions to those feelings.<br><br> Even if you are not so sure that free will is real, you can still benefit from acting as if it is, as the research shows. You don&#39;t have to walk around all day hoping that your environmental and genetic proclivities conspire to give you a pleasant day. On the contrary, conjuring thoughts of free will can inspire you to take control of your life in a positive way. If you are a hybrid thinker, that might mean focusing on your major goals in life, which you believe really are under your control.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he strategy I&#39;m proposing</span> turns out to be similar to the one that Ted Chiang settled on in his story. The narrator, using the same technology that the Predictor exemplifies, is communicating with readers from one year in the future. Looking at the destruction that occurs when people conclude they have no free will, he tells them, “My message to you is this: pretend that you have free will.” In sum: “The reality isn&#39;t important: what&#39;s important is your belief.”<br><br> If the mind-body problem were truly settled, I doubt that we could follow this prescription. But the problem isn&#39;t settled, so your decisions might very well be real and matter very much. In which case, my best advice is to admit that you don&#39;t know, throw up your hands in resignation, laugh at the riddle, and make positive decisions about the day ahead.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/happiness-free-will-mind-body-problem/674883/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/happiness-free-will-mind-body-problem/674883/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Recession Doomers Got the U.S. Economy So Wrong]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> One year ago, experts were certain that America was headed for a recession.

No, not 99.99 percent, as in the odds that you&#39;ll avoid being struck by lighting this evening. One hundred<i> </i>percent, as in the odds that you&#39;ll avoid falling into a time-bending wormhole that spits you out in 17th-century Versailles at a dinner table with Louis XIV.<br><br> Bloomberg&#39;s bot wasn&#39;t unique in its gloom, either. The Federal Reserve itself <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/business/economy/3912631-fed-projects-jobless-rate-to-reach-4-5-percent-by-end-of-2023/">projected</a> hundreds of thousands of job losses by this December. In a survey by the Philadelphia Fed that has been conducted since the late 1960s, the number of economists anticipating an imminent recession hit <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wheres-the-recession-we-were-promised-cd68a992">an all-time high</a> last year, meaning the level of expert pessimism was greater than before the stagflation crisis of the 1970s, the brutal recession of the early 1980s, and the Great Recession of 2008. Economic glumness spread to the C-suite. Last year, a KPMG <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/ceos-see-tougher-recession-kpmg">poll</a> found that nine in 10 chief executives anticipated a recession in 2023. Republicans eagerly piled on, proactively <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/survey-economists-expect-biden-recession-slowing-growth-job-losses/">blaming</a> the White House for a “Cruel Biden Recession” that all the experts seemingly claimed was inevitable.<br><br> And how&#39;d those experts do? So far, terribly. We&#39;re now in the back half of a year that was supposedly doomed, and the US economy isn&#39;t just narrowly avoiding a downturn. As the writer Noah Smith <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/if-this-is-a-bad-economy-please-tell">points out</a> , nearly everything you should want to go well in an economy is going <i>quite</i> well right now.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/us-economy-recession-interest-rates-inflation/673238/">Annie Lowrey: The reason the recession hasn&#39;t happened yet</a><br><br> Employment is high, inflation is falling, real incomes are rising, and inequality is narrowing. Superlatives abound. The official unemployment rate is near a 60-year low, and the jobless rate for Black Americans recently hit an all-time low. The US has the fastest growth rate <i>and</i> the lowest annual inflation of any G7 country. Yes, problems exist. Essentials such as housing, education, and health care are still too expensive; wages could be growing faster; and last year&#39;s inflation is still baked into today&#39;s prices. But mostly, things are good—for now.<br><br> In fairness, economists had some fine reasons to expect a rough 2023. When inflation surged to multi-decade highs, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. As economists, including Larry Summers, pointed out, deploying high rates to combat high inflation has historically been a simple recipe for a recession. The logic is straightforward. Higher interest rates increase the cost of capital, which reduces investment, which blunts hiring, which reduces wage growth, which depresses spending, and ta-da, you&#39;ve produced an economic downturn that cools prices.<br><br> But that&#39;s not how 2023 has gone at all. Instead, we seem very close to something like “immaculate disinflation”—an unusual case of falling inflation without rising unemployment. So what, exactly, might experts have gotten so wrong? How did we beat a serious case of inflation without, to date, triggering a downturn?<br><br> The first explanation is that economic prediction has always been more sorcery than science. Since the Philly Fed survey started in 1968, the majority of economists have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-think-they-can-see-recession-comingfor-a-change-11670150634?mod=article_inline">failed</a> to anticipate <i>every single</i> recession. Less than a third of economists foresaw the 1990 and 2001 downturns, and they whiffed on the 2008 crash. Economic models of the future are perhaps best understood as astrology faintly decorated with calculus equations.<br><br> The second explanation is that the US economy bravely withstood a number of shocks—and then the shocks went away. JP Morgan&#39;s Michael Cembalest <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://assets.jpmprivatebank.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/rasputin-effect.pdf">wrote</a> that the economy&#39;s resilience reminds him of Rasputin, the Russian mystic who survived poisoning, several beatings, and a few shootings. Similarly, the US economy has endured a gauntlet of pain: a wild surge in post-pandemic spending on stuff like cars and electronics, and then broken supply chains that couldn&#39;t handle all this new demand, a historic increase in resignations as the service sector came back online, a spike in energy prices after the initial invasion of Ukraine, a run on real estate that depleted inventory, and don&#39;t forget the slowdown in China and, of course, rocketing interest rates. That&#39;s a lot! The shocks came from all over: high demand, low supply, geopolitics, international shipping, Vladimir Putin&#39;s imperial mania. But eventually, the pain subsided, and the Rasputin-esque US economy is alive today because the tortuous inflation surprises have mostly dissipated.<br><br> This explanation leaves out the Federal Reserve entirely. And perhaps that&#39;s telling. One cheeky lesson of the past 15 years might be that monetary policy is weaker than most experts thought at both stimulating and depressing growth. During the 2010s, the Obama administration (constrained by Republican intransigence) leaned on the Fed and low interest rates to lift the moribund economy, but economic growth was rather putrid anyway. If the Fed wasn&#39;t strong enough then to stimulate an economy suffering from depressed demand, and isn&#39;t strong enough now to depress an economy overstimulated by high inflation, maybe we need a new theory of just how important interest rates are to overall economic health.<br><br> But as the writer Matt Yglesias <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://substack.com/app-link/post?publication_id=159185&amp;post_id=135591949&amp;utm_source=post-email-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNTc1NjEsInBvc3RfaWQiOjEzNTU5MTk0OSwiaWF0IjoxNjkwOTcwNzExLCJleHAiOjE2OTM1NjI3MTEsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xNTkxODUiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.IbM9Wi_MGubnI3j4fIA6Cywv-CMhsQV2d376dsQTLlI">points out</a> , another interpretation of the past two years gives the Fed a bit more credit. The central bank is not just a mute wizard with a joystick that raises and lowers interest rates. Central bankers talk. Their talking shapes expectations, moods, <i>vibes</i> . The chair of the Federal Reserve is the chief vibemeister of the US economy, and conceivably the combination of his statements and his actions has maneuvered the US economy into the Goldilocks zone by making Americans <i>just anxious enough</i> to throttle consumer spending and wage growth while other economic disruptions went away.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/inflation-jobs-unemployment-recession/674593/">Adam Ozimek: The simple mistake that almost triggered a recession</a><br><br> I like this idea. For the past few months, I&#39;ve been puzzling over a related mystery, which is why ordinary Americans are so convinced that the economy is terrible. In April, just as unemployment hit a 60-year low, a record-high share of the public <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/public-pessimism-on-the-economy-hits-a-new-high-cnbc-survey-shows.html">expressed</a> negative views of the economy. Now, Jeff Bezos famously said that “when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.” But Americans&#39; feelings have been factually disconnected from reality. This summer, nearly half of Americans said we were in a recession, which is just incorrect. In April, Americans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/public-pessimism-on-the-economy-hits-a-new-high-cnbc-survey-shows.html">said</a> it was the worst time to buy stocks in almost 20 years. But the S&amp;P 500 had surged 14 percent in six months leading up to April, and stocks are up another 11 percent since then.<br><br> Discounting the pessimism of tens of millions of Americans would be crass. But something important and weird is going on here. The writer Kyla Scanlon has memorably diagnosed what we&#39;re experiencing as a “vibecession,” in which people are happily contributing to a growing economy even as they externalize the vague anxiety that everything is about to fall apart. In a similar vein, I wrote an article titled <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/american-economy-negative-perception-inflation/661149/">“&#39;Everything Is Terrible, but I&#39;m Fine,&#39;”</a> noting that people in surveys keep saying they are depressed about the state of the national economy but hopeful (and even happy) about the state of their household economy.<br><br> At this point, you might be thinking, <i>Wait, what does all of this have to do with our central question?</i> Well, here&#39;s a complex and unprovable theory: Maybe the recession doomers got the economy very wrong precisely because they were so convincing. A sense of economic dusk took the edge off spending, hiring, and wage growth, and that, in turn, reduced inflation without as yet causing a full-blown recession.<br><br> So, this is my favorite theory: The vibecession prevented the real recession. In medicine, weaker versions of a virus, like the flu, inoculate people against the real thing. By analogy, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his melancholy minions essentially administered an injection of mostly safe gloom into the economic bloodstream, which seems to have triggered just the right level of macroeconomic immune response to reduce inflation without causing a downturn.<br><br> Or maybe all of these theories are true at once. Economic forecasts are genre fiction. America Rasputined its way out of the crisis years. The Fed&#39;s titrated pessimism successfully reduced inflation at the margins. And maybe the very act of writing this article guarantees that we&#39;ll have a recession at the end of this year.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/recession-doomers-economy/674900/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/recession-doomers-economy/674900/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Real Weaponization of the Department of Justice]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Jack Smith&#39;s indictment shows that the abuse of government Republicans have been seeking was there all along. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/3tanpFFDKshaihMK_z2OzzU-jME=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/DOJWeaponization/original.png" alt="插图包含唐纳德·特朗普和杰弗里·克拉克的照片" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by The Atlantic.

The only problem is that it was conducted by Trump and his allies, in an effort to stay in power, against the will of the American people.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">David A. Graham: Trump attempted a brazen, dead-serious attack on American democracy</a><br><br> Let&#39;s start by defining <i>weaponizing</i> . Different administrations will have different policy desires and interpretations of the law. Sometimes that can veer into untoward behavior—Democrats griped that Trump was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-democratic-governors-cuomo/609124/">openly favoring red states</a> early in the coronavirus pandemic, and Republicans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/07/the-federal-takeover-of-state-governments/375270/">complained</a> that Barack Obama inappropriately bullied state governments into expanding entitlements—though it&#39;s not inherently illegal or unethical.<br><br> But if a federal agency contrived to make false claims under official cover for the express purpose of obtaining a political or electoral outcome, that would seem to be a straightforward example of weaponizing government. That&#39;s just what Smith alleges: “In late December 2020, the Defendant attempted to use the Justice Department to make knowingly false claims of election fraud to officials in the targeted states through a formal letter under the Acting Attorney General&#39;s signature, thus giving the Defendant&#39;s lies the backing of the federal government and attempting to improperly influence the targeted states to replace legitimate [Joe] Biden electors with the Defendant&#39;s.”<br><br> During that time, according to the indictment, a co-conspirator—who circumstances indicate is Jeffrey Clark, then–assistant attorney general—met with Trump at the White House, in violation of Justice Department rules. Following those discussions, Clark drafted a letter to the Georgia legislature, which he proposed the acting attorney general and deputy attorney general sign, stating falsely that the DOJ had “identified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States”; that the DOJ believed that two separate, valid sets of electors had been submitted to Congress; and that the legislature should hold a special session to decide which would go forth—apparently in the hopes that the GOP-led legislature would select the bogus Trump slate of electors.<br><br> Smith doesn&#39;t connect all the dots in the indictment, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/leave-rest-me/619621/">but the House January 6 committee did</a> . According to its investigation, the goal was not to have the DOJ take any other action beyond the letter. Trump just wanted the letter to create doubt and give a pretext to Republican members of Congress to reject the election results on January 6. “Don&#39;t expect you to do that, just say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R[epublican] Congressmen,” Trump said, according to notes taken by Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general.<br><br> The sham investigation is a favorite Trump tactic. He tried to employ it during his extortion of Ukraine in 2019, when he made clear that he didn&#39;t care whether Ukraine actually investigated the Biden family&#39;s business there, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/all-trump-cared-about-was-announcing-investigation/602335/">only that it <i>announced</i> an investigation</a> he could use for political purposes. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/its-all-about-the-investigation/616836/">He tried the move again in late October 2020</a> after another nebulous story about Hunter Biden. Trump understood that the actual investigation didn&#39;t matter—in fact, it might have hurt him if it had debunked allegations—but that the aroma of scandal could assist him.<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/its-all-about-the-investigation/616836/">David A. Graham: It&#39;s all about the investigation</a><br><br> Donoghue declined to sign Clark&#39;s letter, and reiterated that the claims were false. But Clark didn&#39;t relent. He told his bosses that Trump was going to name him acting attorney general but that he&#39;d decline if they signed the letter. On January 3, Trump offered him the job, and Clark accepted. That evening, Donoghue and Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen came to meet Trump and told him that the DOJ would see mass resignations if Clark were appointed. Only then did Trump back down from the scheme.<br><br> These are allegations in the sense that they have not been proved in a court, but they don&#39;t require much faith to accept. <i>The Washington Post</i> , <i>The New York Times</i> , and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> all <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/jeffrey-clark-justice-department-trump-coup/617818/">reported the basic thrust of the plot in January 2021</a> , just weeks after it happened. The House January 6 committee <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/its-all-about-the-investigation/616836/">added more detail in sworn testimony</a> . (That committee perhaps better deserved the mantle of investigating the weaponization of government.) The Trump campaign, in its statement on the indictment yesterday, didn&#39;t even bother to contest the allegations.<br><br> As the indictment notes, the goal of this alleged conspiracy was “to injure, oppress, threaten, and intimidate one or more persons in the free exercise and enjoyment of a right and privilege secured to them by the Constitution and laws of the United States—that is, the right to vote, and to have one&#39;s vote counted.” Tom Cole was right: It is undeniable that the federal government abused its authority for political purposes. He just should have been more specific about which president and which party those abuses served.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 21:24:40 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/jeffrey-clark-doj-weaponization-trump-indictment/674898/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/jeffrey-clark-doj-weaponization-trump-indictment/674898/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ukrainian Counteroffensive Is Not an Action Movie]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The summer of drones and trenches drags on, but hopeful signs are emerging. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ECnd-Hk80JC3r7yhI5R0oO1L6lg=/0x260:5000x3072/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/GettyImages_1566599462/original.jpg" alt="一名乌克兰士兵走过乌克兰卢甘斯克州前线的一个村庄废墟" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Diego Herrera Carcedo / Anadolu Agency / Getty</figcaption></figure> <small><i>This is an edition of</i> The Atlantic <i>Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a></small><br><br> The Ukrainian counteroffensive, under way since the spring, is slogging through miles of trenches and minefields.

The enemy knows you&#39;re coming, they&#39;ve prepared for your attacks, and their objective is to cede back as little ground as possible while making you pay in blood for every inch. Offensive operations, such as the initial Russian invasion into Ukraine, are different: They are predicated on shock, speed, and mobility, especially if they begin with at least some modicum of surprise.<br><br> The American military, with its focus on operational excellence, executes such offensives very well. In its wars over the past 30 years, the US has had almost every edge over its battlefield enemies, including superior firepower, complete control of the skies, advanced technology, and a superbly trained force.<br><br> The Ukrainians have almost none of these advantages. Their weaponry, including tanks and air defenses, has been getting better, but not fast enough. They are outnumbered by an enemy that uses untrained troops dredged from prisons as bullet sponges. Meanwhile, the Ukrainians must carefully conserve their best-trained forces to protect them from being wasted in engagement with soldiers who are in effect walking dead men.<br><br> Worse, even to <i>get</i> to those doomed Russian forces, the Ukrainians have to spend time—and lives—clearing the so-called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mickryan.substack.com/p/the-state-of-the-ukraine-campaign">Surovikin Line</a> , named for the general who designed Russia&#39;s defensive position in Ukraine (and who is now apparently under some sort of detention—a  Moscow <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66183656">official has said</a> he is “resting”—because of his apparent involvement with the mutineer Yevgeny Prigozhin). As <i>The</i> <i>Bulwark</i> senior editor Benjamin Parker <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://plus.thebulwark.com/p/the-three-battles-raging-in-ukraine?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2">pointed out on Monday</a> , this is not really a line but “a series of zones, sometimes miles deep, of minefields, tank traps, trenches, booby traps, and other fortifications,” and the Ukrainians lack the kind of reconnaissance and firepower that Western militaries would normally use to overcome such obstacles.<br><br> Nonetheless, there are some hopeful signs. For one thing, the fact that the Ukrainians are on the offensive <i>at all</i> is something of a miracle. Americans, as my friend and fellow Russia-watcher Nick Gvosdev pointed out to me recently, tend to think of military conflicts as having the same narrative arc as action movies: The good guys take an initial ass-kicking at the beginning, go through a <i>Rocky</i> -like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://collider.com/best-training-montages-from-rocky-creed-ranked/">training-and-recovery montage</a> , and then crush the bad guys. That&#39;s not reality; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/06/putin-nuclear-ukraine-counteroffensive/674462/">as I warned</a> earlier this summer, the dramatic blowing of a whistle and a charge from the trenches was never going to happen.<br><br> But Ukraine survives and is taking the fight to the enemy, both on the battlefield and in Russia&#39;s capital city. The original Russian plan, more than a year and a half ago, was to erase Ukraine as a state in a matter of days. Instead, the Russians are complaining about repeated <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/world/europe/ukraine-drone-strikes-russia.html">Ukrainian drone strikes</a> in the heart of Moscow, while President Vladimir Putin&#39;s forces, however slowly, are ceding back occupied territory.<br><br> These drone attacks have been small and ineffective—so small, in fact, that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/05/what-happens-if-russia-stashes-nukes-in-belarus/674221/?utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_term=2023-05-26T22%3A12%3A59&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">my first guess</a> about their origin this past spring was that they were a Russian false-flag operation. But they have had an outsize psychological impact on Putin&#39;s regime. Back in 2022, Putin&#39;s implicit bargain with his citizens was that the war would be glorious, short, and kept far from Russia.<br><br> The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66368016">latest drone</a> in Moscow struck a skyscraper housing some government agencies. It produced no casualties but broke a lot of glass; apparently, it also broke the Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/steven_pifer/status/1686366890099425280?s=20">compared the attack to 9/11</a> . Zakharova knows better, as do I, because I was in Moscow just weeks after the actual 9/11. The atmosphere in the Russian capital back then was somber—and, to an American visitor, sympathetic. The Russians knew the magnitude of 9/11, and for Putin&#39;s stooges to now invoke the attack shows both their cynicism and their humiliation. After all, the Ukrainians by this point were supposed to have been building schools named for Putin, not rattling the nerves of Kremlin flacks with late-night explosions.<br><br> Ukrainian forces have also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/world/europe/ukraine-counteroffensive-russia.html">recaptured the village of Staromaiorske</a> as part of a move to the south that could imperil Russian supply lines. There are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/31/1189986016/russiB-ukraine-war-news">reports</a> of accelerating attacks in the Zaporizhzhia region, where the Russians have dug in and mined the area around Europe&#39;s largest nuclear plant. (The Russians, for their part, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/world/europe/ukraine-counteroffensive.html">claim</a> that the Ukrainians launched a “massive” attack toward Zaporizhzhia, but remember that it is in the Russian interest to inflate the size of every Ukrainian attack: If Russian defenses hold, they have repelled an onslaught, but if they fall, it was to a “massive” attack.)<br><br> Another potential sign of Russian desperation: The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-wagner-fighters-move-closer-polish-border-poland-pm-says-2023-07-29/">Poles have reported</a> that roughly 100 men from Prigozhin&#39;s Wagner Group, the mercenaries who have been effective fighters in Ukraine and who nearly marched to Moscow in June, might be approaching the Polish border from their new home in neighboring Belarus. (Poland has also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/02/europe/poland-belarus-wagner-nato-tensions-intl/index.html">accused</a> Belarus of violating Polish airspace.)<br><br> Belarus&#39;s president and Putin&#39;s fellow dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, has been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/lukashenko-taunts-poland-again-over-wagner-troops-near-border-2023-08-01/">taunting</a> the Poles, saying that Warsaw should thank him for keeping Wagner forces in check, but it&#39;s hard to know exactly what Putin or Prigozhin think they&#39;re doing by rattling this tiny saber at a NATO nation. The US ambassador to the United Nations, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://usun.usmission.gov/remarks-by-ambassador-linda-thomas-greenfield-at-a-virtual-new-york-foreign-press-center-briefing-on-the-u-s-presidency-of-the-un-security-council/">said on Monday</a> that attacks by Wagner mercenaries would be viewed by the United States “as an attack by the Russian Government,” and if Putin thinks that trying to rattle the Poles will somehow weaken NATO support for Ukraine, then he still does not understand the nature of the disaster he&#39;s created.<br><br> I am not overly worried about Wagner&#39;s Potemkin pantomiming, nor do I think the Russians really believe they are living through a new 9/11. But I am concerned that Americans and others in the West do not understand the immensity of the task before the Ukrainians, who must recapture territory that has been turned into a hellscape of death traps. The United States and its allies should speed up aid at this crucial moment. As my colleague David Frum <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1535794951002497030?s=20">implored</a> more than a year ago: “If there&#39;s anything that Ukraine can use in any NATO warehouse from Vancouver to Vilnius, that&#39;s a scandal.

I have a special place in my heart for <i>The Verdict</i> because I was working where some key scenes were filmed.<br><br> In early 1982, I was a college student but also a full-time legislative aide in the Massachusetts State House. <i>The Verdict</i> used the statehouse to double as the fictional St. Catherine Labouré Hospital. The director apparently wanted something with a rundown, Depression-era feel, much like the St. Eligius of the NBC drama <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083483/"><i>St. Elsewhere</i></a> , which began airing that same year. The statehouse, with its stone walls and tiled floors, was the opposite of a brightly lit and antiseptic modern hospital. (I loved the statehouse specifically for its seedy public-works grandeur.)<br><br> One morning, I got off the elevator and walked into a “hospital ward.” I thought we&#39;d had some kind of disaster or a gas leak or something. I figured out that filming was under way, but I had work to do, and the sets were closed. I knew all of the back hallways and shortcuts; later that day I went barreling down a narrow (and rarely used) staircase and almost plowed right into … Paul Newman and some of the crew. I wish I could say that I said something clever or shook his hand, but they were busy, so I apologized and kept moving.<br><br> I love the movie for its Boston ambience, and for Newman&#39;s astonishing performance. (He was robbed for Best Actor at the Academy Awards; Ben Kingsley won the Oscar for <i>Gandhi</i> that year.) And I especially love it because anyone who&#39;s gone through a dark period in their lives and somehow kept their faith can identify with Newman&#39;s portrait of a lost man returning to himself—but that&#39;s a story for another day.<br><br> — Tom<br><br> <i>Katherine Hu contributed to this newsletter.</i><br><br> <em>When you buy a book using a link in this newsletter, we receive a commission.

If you&#39;re trying to understand how, despite all of this, Trump could still be president again, you need look no further than the reactions of his primary rivals and the conservative media.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indictment-jan-6-committee-jack-smith/674889/">Quinta Jurecic: The triumph of the January 6 committee</a><br><br> Despite acknowledging that he “had not read the indictment,” Florida Governor Ron DeSantis <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/us/politics/desantis-trump-washington-dc.html">tweeted that prosecuting someone</a> for trying to overthrow constitutional democracy in America was an example of the “weaponization of the federal government.” Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/votetimscott/status/1686541512916553728?s=20">wrote that he was</a> “concerned about the weaponization of Biden&#39;s DOJ and its immense power used against political opponents.” The Fox News host Jesse Watters <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/fox-news/fox-news-immediately-runs-frantic-defense-trump-after-latest-indictment">called the indictment</a> “a political war crime.” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/08/this-trump-indictment-shouldnt-stand/?utm_source=recirc-desktop&amp;utm_medium=homepage&amp;utm_campaign=hero&amp;utm_content=related&amp;utm_term=first"><em>National Review</em> editorialized</a> that the indictment was an attempt to “criminalize protected political speech and flimsy legal theories.” Then there are those who insist that it is the prosecutions themselves that sustain Trump by provoking a defensive reaction in the conservative base—even as right-wing media figures tell their pliant audiences that those prosecutions are politically motivated, though they surely know better.<br><br> If you&#39;re wondering how Trump has survived as a candidate for office, you can look squarely at the conservative elites in politics and media—including many people who would prefer to be rid of him—who have staked out the position that trying to overthrow the government is not illegal if a Republican does it. Those defending Trump after his indictment over his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/trumps-farcical-inept-and-deadly-serious-coup-attempt/617309/">attempted <em>autogolpe</em></a> are not opposing the politicization of justice; they are demanding it.<br><br> Smith&#39;s indictment documents in detail that Trump&#39;s attempt to stay in power was not mere verbal advocacy, but a series of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/five-ways-donald-trump-tried-coup/620157/">comprehensive schemes that failed</a> . Trump attempted to coerce Republican state legislators into overturning the results in their states on the basis of his false claims of election fraud. He and his co-conspirators hatched a scheme to put forth “fraudulent electors” to be used as a substitute for the real ones so as to alter the election results. He tried to force the Department of Justice to substantiate those false claims in order to provide pretext for overturning the outcome of the election, then threatened to replace the department&#39;s leadership with one of his cronies. He tried to pressure then–Vice President Mike Pence to use his nonexistent authority to hold up the election certification so the results could be overturned. Trump invited a mob to Washington, DC, on the false premise that the election had been stolen and the crowd&#39;s presence could change the outcome, and then tried to exploit the chaos of the riot he inspired on January 6 by pressuring senators to continue to hold up the certification. The indictment shows that, when told that seizing power would lead to “riots in the streets,” his advisers contemplated using the military to repress prodemocracy protesters by force, turning the nation&#39;s military against its own citizens for opposing a coup. “That&#39;s why there&#39;s an Insurrection Act,” one Trump “co-conspirator” said to the deputy White House counsel, according to the indictment.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">David A. Graham: Trump attempted a brazen, dead-serious attack on American democracy</a><br><br> Saying that this is mere “political speech and flimsy legal theories” is ludicrous. If you ask to borrow money from a bank, that is not a crime. But if you demand cash at gunpoint, it is a crime, and laws against armed robbery do not become a threat to free speech simply because the act involves saying the words “empty the register.” If Trump had merely bloviated about fraud without taking material steps to stay in power illegally, there would be no crime. But Trump did so much more than fume.<br><br> More to the point, the indictment underscores the extent to which Republicans with authority tried to resist Trump&#39;s efforts to seize power. Most of his attorneys and advisers told him the election was over. The then-leadership of the Justice Department threatened mass resignations if Trump replaced those in charge with his own quislings to further his conspiracy. Republican state legislators rejected his demands to overturn the results in their states. The Supreme Court did not go along with ratifying the campaign&#39;s nonsensical legal claims. Pence, up to that point a reliable Trump enabler, refused to assert power he did not have. Indeed, if there is any evidence of “weaponization of the Justice Department,” it is in Trump&#39;s attempts to use its authority to aid his conspiracy to seize power.<br><br> I do not want to overstate things here: Refusing to go along with an attempted coup is the minimum to be expected from the political elite in a democratic system. They fulfilled their responsibilities in doing so, and that&#39;s much better than the alternative. We do not know if they would resist so strongly a second time.<br><br> Outside the administration and conservative movement, Trump&#39;s political opponents defeated him at the ballot box, impeached him, and were prevented from convicting him by Republican legislators. The independent counsel assigned to the case has indicted him on the basis of a detailed record of his crimes that offers clear evidence of criminal intent and action.<br><br> The hard-core authoritarian right that has risen in Trump&#39;s shadow, the one contemplating political purges, noncompetitive elections, and iron-fisted state repression of its political opposition, has no commitment to democracy as an ideal, and its continued support is no mystery. The group is small in number, even if a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/stephen-miller-alarming-emails/602242/">committed political vanguard</a> can have influence beyond its numbers, especially given its growing acceptance in mainstream-Republican circles.<br><br> The majority of conservative elites, however, retains some philosophical commitment to democracy and self-governance. They have nevertheless repeatedly failed the most basic test of democratic citizenship posed to them, defending the right of their public to choose their leaders. Right-wing media knowingly encouraged the delusions of the conservative base that the election was stolen <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/fox-news-dominion-lawsuit-trump/673132/">out of fear that their audiences would flee</a> . Republican lawmakers, now including Trump&#39;s own primary opponents, have validated the idea that Trump is a victim of political persecution rather than someone who engaged in a conspiracy to keep himself in power, because they fear the electoral cost of opposing him. Immobilized by their own cowardice, both groups remain indefinitely in his thrall.<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/fox-news-dominion-lawsuit-trump/673132/">Adam Serwer: Why did Fox News lie to its viewers?</a><br><br> These two factions are the only ones with the moral authority among conservative voters to erode the fanatical devotion that sustains Trump. No one outside their coalition can do this persuasive work, because of the right&#39;s spectacular success in convincing their own supporters that anyone who is not a conservative is a mortal enemy to all they hold dear.<br><br> Yet conservative elites lack the courage and will to use their influence to oppose Trump, and that is why he remains a force in American politics. Everyone else in the American system has done their duty. The responsibility for Trump&#39;s ongoing political relevance is borne solely by the right-wing elites who, despite a desire to be free of him, continue to sacrifice their own dignity to his ambition.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 19:11:12 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/january-6-indictment-republican-elites-support-trump/674896/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/january-6-indictment-republican-elites-support-trump/674896/</item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump’s Threat to Democracy Is Now Systemic]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Each time GOP leaders have had the opportunity to move away from Trump, the party has sped past the off-ramp. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/xU9jd6muenzN5RjdASxWyJwVIjI=/0x0:5235x2945/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/GettyImages_1139764770/original.jpg" alt="唐纳德·特朗普对记者讲话的照片" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Darren Hauck / Getty Images</figcaption></figure> The long-awaited federal indictment of Donald Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election may be necessary to contain the threat to American democracy that he has unleashed. But it&#39;s unlikely to be sufficient.<br><br> The germ of election denialism that Trump injected into the American political system has spread so far throughout the Republican Party that it is virtually certain to survive whatever legal accountability the former president faces.<br><br> With polls showing that most Republican voters still believe the election was stolen from Trump, that the January 6 riot was legitimate protest, and that Trump&#39;s efforts to subvert the 2020 results did not violate the law or threaten the constitutional system, the United States faces a stark and unprecedented situation. For the first time in the nation&#39;s modern history, the dominant faction in one of our two major parties has repeatedly demonstrated its willingness to accept antidemocratic means to advance its interests.<br><br> The most telling measure of that dynamic inside the GOP is that Trump remains the party&#39;s central figure. Each time GOP voters and leaders have had the opportunity to move away from him—whether in the shock immediately after January 6, or the widespread disappointment over the poor performance of his handpicked candidates during the 2022 election—the party has sped past the off-ramp.<br><br> Polls now show Trump leading in the 2024 GOP presidential race by one of the biggest margins ever recorded for a primary candidate in either party. The Republican majority in the House of Representatives has been exploring ways to expunge his two impeachments and/or block the investigations he faces. Even the other candidates ostensibly running against him for the 2024 GOP nomination have almost uniformly condemned the indictments against him, rather than his underlying behavior. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/hughhewitt/status/1686502931439235072?s=20">Prominent conservatives</a> have argued that Trump cannot receive a fair trial in any Democratic-leaning jurisdiction.<br><br> All of these actions measure how much of the GOP is now willing to accept Trump&#39;s repeated assaults on the basic structures of American democracy. While the key state-level Republicans rejected Trump&#39;s direct demands to invalidate the results in their own states,<b> </b>most House Republicans voted to reject the election results and most Republican state attorneys general filed a lawsuit to decertify the outcome in the key swing states won by President Joe Biden. In the election&#39;s aftermath, the majority of Republican-controlled states, inspired by Trump&#39;s baseless claims of endemic voter fraud, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/06/manchin-republicans-bipartisan/619167/">passed laws on a party-line basis</a> making it more difficult to vote, or increasing partisan control over election administration.<br><br> Sean Wilentz, a Princeton historian who specializes in American politics, told me that US history has no exact precedent for a party embracing a leader so openly hostile to the core pillars of democracy. Presidents have often been accused of violating the Constitution through their <i>policy</i> actions, he said, but there is not another example of a president moving as systematically to<b> </b>“manipulate the apparatus of government or elections in order to subvert the will of the people.”<br><br> The closest parallel to Trump&#39;s actions, Wilentz said, may be the strategies of the slaveholding South in the decades before the Civil War. Those included violent attacks on abolitionists, suppression of antislavery publications, and the promulgation of extreme legal theories such as the denial of basic rights to Black people in the Supreme Court&#39;s 1857 <i>Dred Scott</i> decision, all of which were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/10/biden-2020-trump-election/616912/">designed to protect slavery against the emerging national majority dubious of it</a> . That decades-long “antidemocratic thrust” from the South, Wilentz noted, “finally culminated in the greatest violation of the American Constitution in our history, which was secession.”<br><br> By contrast, Wilentz added, the GOP&#39;s continued embrace of Trump amid the evidence of his misconduct contrasts sharply with the party&#39;s refusal to defend Richard Nixon in the final stages of Watergate. “When Richard Nixon was about to be impeached, he didn&#39;t storm the Capitol to get rid of Barry Goldwater,” Wilentz said, referring to the conservative Republican senator who warned Nixon that he would lose a Senate vote to remove him. “He resigned.”<br><br> All of this suggests that personal accountability for Trump is unlikely to erase the tolerance for antidemocratic actions that has spread in the GOP since his emergence. Yet many experts who study the health of democracy still believe that prosecuting him remains essential.<br><br> Kristy Parker, a counsel at Protect Democracy, a bipartisan group that focuses on threats to democratic institutions, says it is crucial to show the “silent majority” of Americans who support the constitutional system that no one is above the law. “They need to see that the Department of Justice prosecutors are willing to take the risk of indicting Trump,” Parker told me. “They need to see the election workers ensuring that people get their vote counted. They need to see the police officers standing up to the rioters. They need to see people within the system working.”<br><br> Michael Waldman, the president and CEO of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, told me that he has been ambivalent about indicting former presidents, because of the risk of precipitating a retaliatory spiral between the parties. “It is a line that we as a country have never crossed,” Waldman said shortly after the Trump indictment was disclosed last night. “One could imagine how it could be abused and become one more shattered norm.”<br><br> Waldman said that failing to indict Trump would have been far more dangerous, because such a decision would have suggested that there is no effective way to hold presidents accountable for misbehavior. Neither of Trump&#39;s two impeachments really damaged his position in the party, Waldman noted, in part because virtually all GOP elected officials defended his behavior. But the multiple criminal indictments facing Trump, he said, show that “the criminal-justice system still is producing tangible legal consequences” that future presidents cannot brush off as easily as an impeachment.<br><br> Waldman said the trials of hundreds of January 6 rioters already demonstrate that prosecution can have some deterrent effect. Unruly crowds of supporters, Waldman noted, did not descend on courthouses in Manhattan or Florida after Trump&#39;s earlier indictments, despite his signals that he&#39;d like to see that happen. “The fact that this stuff is not just a bad idea but illegal and you can go to jail for it really makes a big difference,” Waldman said.<br><br> John Dean, the White House counsel whose Senate testimony helped doom Nixon during Watergate, also considers prosecution of Trump to be “essential,” he told me. President Gerald Ford&#39;s decision to pardon Nixon and preempt a trial, Dean said, was “a historical disaster,” because it emboldened presidents to believe they would never face criminal charges for their actions. Allowing Trump to avoid consequences, Dean believes, would send an even more dangerous signal than Ford did with Nixon. “Trump&#39;s corruption is so much more fundamental to the system than Nixon&#39;s,” Dean said. “Nixon, he abused power, he had his enemies list, he wanted to make government work for the benefit of Republicans and not Democrats. But he wasn&#39;t going after the foundations of government and the system like Trump.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indictment-gop-trial/674813/">Peter Wehner: The indictment of Donald Trump—and his enablers</a><br><br> Trump&#39;s effort to overturn the 2020 election required the cooperation of many other GOP officials and conservative activists and lawyers. Now a growing number of them face consequences of their own, including disbarment proceedings, ongoing state and local investigations, and the potential of further federal charges from Special Counsel Jack Smith against the six unnamed co-conspirators listed in the Trump indictment.<br><br> “I&#39;m not sure how much additional prosecutions will deter Trump—unfortunately, he&#39;s all-in on winning as a way to stay out of prison at this point,” says the Dartmouth College political scientist Brendan Nyhan, a co-founder of Bright Line Watch, a collaborative of political scientists studying threats to US democracy. “But Republican operatives and activists may hesitate as the evidence mounts that participating in an attempted coup puts you in legal jeopardy. That&#39;s important, because Trump can&#39;t carry out his plots by himself.”<br><br> Some analysts have worried that the trials could strengthen Trump if die-hard supporters of his on a jury refuse to convict him regardless of the evidence. But Parker told me that cannot be allowed to dissuade prosecutors from bringing cases when there&#39;s evidence that Trump violated the law. The problem, she said, is analogous to the challenges she faced as a Department of Justice civil-rights attorney prosecuting excessive-force cases against police officers who were likely more popular in the community than the victims they abused: “You can&#39;t just give in and allow, effectively, a bully to force his way out of accountability, because then you&#39;ve crushed the ideal that no one is above the law.”<br><br> Yet although all these possible sanctions create <i>legal</i> reasons for the GOP to resist another Trump-led attack on democracy, the party&#39;s <i>political</i> incentives point in the opposite direction.<br><br> A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://brightlinewatch.org/uncharted-territory-the-aftermath-of-presidential-indictments/">recent national poll released by the Bright Line Watch project</a> found that the majority of Republican voters accepted all of Trump&#39;s key arguments about 2020 and the multiplying legal challenges accumulating against him. In that survey, only small minorities of Republicans said that he had committed crimes in any of the cases he&#39;s facing. Most Republicans said Trump was singled out for prosecution for behavior that would not have prompted charges against other people. Six in 10 Republicans described the January 6 riot as “legitimate protest.” And although the share of Republicans who said that Biden was elected through fraud had declined somewhat from its peak of about three-fourths, nearly two-thirds of them still denied the legitimacy of his victory.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indictment-jan-6-committee-jack-smith/674889/">Quinta Jurecic: The triumph of the January 6 Committee</a><br><br> These attitudes provide an ominous backdrop to Trump&#39;s hints that if he wins the nomination but loses the general election, he&#39;s likely to challenge the results again. Trump might not attempt another mass physical attack on the Capitol in 2025, but such sentiments could allow him to enlist Republicans again for a more targeted legal effort to overthrow the results in a few key states or in Congress, Nyhan told me. The widespread Republican rejection of the idea that Trump violated any laws in his actions after 2020 offers reason to doubt that the party would object any more strenuously if he launched another campaign to delegitimize the results in 2024.<br><br> Nyhan said he can imagine future circumstances in which Democrats at some point challenge the legitimacy of a presidential race, such as the election coming down to a Republican-controlled state that has restricted voting rights. But he said the more immediate danger is that Republicans won&#39;t accept any presidential race they lose. Traditionally, presidential nominees from each party, including Al Gore and John McCain, have made statements in which “the losing side specifically affirms the legitimacy of the winner,” Nyhan said. But for the GOP next year, he added, “we can no longer take that for granted whether or not Trump is the nominee, and that&#39;s really worrisome.”<br><br> Trump may constitute a unique threat to America&#39;s democratic traditions. But he has always <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/01/capitol-riot-and-white-conservatives-extremism/617615/">connected his claims of pervasive electoral fraud to the widespread anxiety among white, Christian conservatives</a> that they are losing control of the country to a racially diverse, secular, and LGBTQ-friendly Democratic coalition centered in the nation&#39;s largest cities. As Trump put it during one 2020 rally before a predominantly white, rural audience in Georgia: “This is <i>our</i> country. And you know this, and you see it, but they are trying to take it from us through rigging, fraud, deception, and deceit.” Whether Trump is convicted for trying to overturn the 2020 election or not, voters who accept that argument will remain the most powerful force in the GOP coalition. And they will continue to demand leaders who will fight the changes that they believe threaten their position in American society.<br><br> Those other Republican leaders may not attempt to overturn an election as brazenly as Trump did with the conduct Smith catalogs in his indictment. But, as Wilentz told me, for the foreseeable future, they are likely to pursue other means “toward the same end: that majoritarian democracy cannot be tolerated under any circumstances if the outcome is not what you wanted it to be.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 19:08:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trump-indictment-gop-jan-6/674895/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trump-indictment-gop-jan-6/674895/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Vladimir Putin and the Parable of the ‘Cornered Rat’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> We may be getting the moral of the Russian leader&#39;s childhood story all wrong. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/501CQ3RXYB3rSHU9DZZ_5T7o36w=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/RatInACorner/original.png" alt="一只老鼠站在涂有俄罗斯国旗白、蓝、红条纹的角落里。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by The Atlantic; Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> Rarely have so few, seemingly inconsequential words generated so many consequential ones.<br><br> In a mere 109-word paragraph tucked away in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/p/putin-first.html">an autobiographical collection of interviews</a> published in 2000, just as he ascended to power in Russia, Vladimir Putin tells a nightmarish tale: Once, when he and his friends were chasing rats with sticks in the dilapidated apartment building in St. Petersburg where he grew up, a “huge rat” he&#39;d cornered suddenly “lashed around and threw itself at” him, chasing the “surprised and frightened” Putin to his door before he slammed it shut in the rodent&#39;s face. For Putin, it&#39;s a parable: “I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word <em>cornered</em> .”<br><br> More than two decades later, that anecdotal seed has sprouted into a ubiquitous narrative that has helped shape the West&#39;s response to Russia&#39;s war against Ukraine. A cornered Putin, commentators and policy makers in the United States and Europe have frequently insisted, could behave like the rat, lashing out even with weapons of mass destruction if provoked. The assumption has informed policies on arms provisions to Ukraine and nuclear deterrence against Russia.<br><br> Yet the Russian leader&#39;s response to Yevgeny Prigozhin&#39;s failed mutiny in June has called the cornered-rat concept into question. Some experts argue that Russian propaganda amplified the metaphor, and that Putin&#39;s reaction to the rebellion exposed it as a lie. Others paint a more complicated picture, suggesting that the story does reveal deep truths about Putin, but not the ones we imagined.<br><br> To better understand the Russian leader&#39;s psychology—and make sounder policy decisions as a result—it&#39;s worth tracing how an obscure vignette from Putin&#39;s childhood took on such a prominent life of its own.<br><br> Putin has retold the rat story, and the lesson he learned about the perils of cornering others, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AY9nEAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1579&amp;lpg=PA1579&amp;dq=rat+%22giving+him+the+fright+of+his+life%22+short+putin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WiBCOCcptZ&amp;sig=ACfU3U2aou1lzS-_EMKo10QXfPAMJMwGPA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjI2Pj1opSAAxVhFVkFHU6UBfMQ6AF6BAghEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=rat%20%22giving%20him%20the%20fright%20of%20his%20life%22%20short%20putin&amp;f=false">several</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-03-25/the-dangers-of-cornering-vladimir-putin">times</a> in the 23 years since he first dropped the biographical breadcrumb, including in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/transcript-vladimir-putin/">2005 <em>60 Minutes</em> interview</a> .

A May 2022 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://transcripts.cnn.com/show/csr/date/2022-05-21/segment/01">CNN documentary</a> promising to take viewers “inside the mind” of the Russian leader seized on the rat story as a leitmotif of his biography, noting that Putin grew up in the “darkest corners” of St. Petersburg and that being “trapped in a corner only to fight his way out” has been “a theme throughout Vladimir Putin&#39;s life,” building to the big question: “Erratic, obsessed, enraged. Is Putin now that cornered rat he once encountered?”<br><br> References to the tale tend to crop up when Putin is either issuing nuclear threats or under intense economic or military pressure, and they have become so common that experts often describe Putin as a “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/opinion/ukraine-war-putin.html">cornered</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2022/10/18/deterring_a_cornered_rat_making_putin_think_twice_about_the_use_of_nuclear_weapons_859677.html">rat</a> ” or even “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-10525223/Vladimir-Putin-snarling-rat-backed-corner-writes-IAN-BIRRELL.html">a snarling rat backed into a corner</a> ,” with nary a mention of the childhood story that spawned the metaphor.

Shortly after Putin&#39;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, for example, the journalist Masha Gessen <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-putin-wants-russians-to-see-the-war-in-ukraine">wrote</a> that the rat story “keeps coming up in my conversations in Moscow” and that “no one who has ever heard it doubts that the adult Putin identifies with the rat.”<br><br> Around the same time, the Cold War historian Vladislav Zubok told me he was alarmed by those in the West who “keep shouting, &#39;Press this guy Putin against the wall. Squash him like a rat! Kill him!&#39; And this guy has a nuclear button. Come on! Don&#39;t make him nervous.” Andrei​ Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based expert on Russian politics at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote to me that, in his opinion, the cornered-rat image “is very accurate.” He noted that Putin “responds to every challenge (eg damage to the Crimean bridge) with a brutal attack (eg missile strikes).”<br><br> But other experts—such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJXxmbtaiM8">Polyakova</a> , who studies disinformation, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/news/transcripts/an-expert-briefing-on-the-wagner-mutiny-and-whats-next-for-russia-and-ukraine/">Herbst</a> , a former US ambassador to Ukraine—argue that Putin and the Kremlin have intentionally spread the image of Putin as a cornered rat as a form of propaganda, a verminous spin on Richard Nixon&#39;s “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb517-Nixon-Kissinger-and-the-Madman-Strategy-during-Vietnam-War/">Madman Theory</a> .” They hypothesize that Putin, as a former KGB agent during the Cold War, would have been well versed in psychological operations and thus likely had a calculated reason to repeatedly relay the rat story and the lesson he drew from it.<br><br> Whether or not Putin had an ulterior motive in sharing the rat story, Herbst told me, the Russian leader and “his henchmen” have emphasized the trope over the years “to instill fear in Western policy makers and also in policy makers in smaller, closer-by countries” that if they oppose Putin getting what he wants, he will strike back in devastating ways. Putin doesn&#39;t have to repeat the story often, Herbst said, because the West has done the work for him by amplifying its theme.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/03/the-accidental-autocrat/303725/">Read: The accidental autocrat</a><br><br> As striking as the story&#39;s repetition is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/08/vladimir-putin-backs-down-russia-ukraine/">the frequency</a> with which it has failed to predict Putin&#39;s behavior. Faced with Yevgeny Prigozhin&#39;s June rebellion—as mercenaries marched toward Moscow—Putin&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/25/putin-prigozhin-rebellion-kremlin-disarray/">reaction</a> was not to lunge forward but rather to back away, negotiate with the Wagner Group leader, and make concessions to the mutineers to defuse the crisis.<br><br> Polyakova considers Putin&#39;s behavior during the episode consistent with a broader pattern that even predates the current conflict: “In every instance where we [in the West] have pushed back against either Russian aggression or Russia&#39;s economic interests, there hasn&#39;t been this &#39;all hell breaks loose&#39; response.”<br><br> Herbst agrees. He points out that Western countries have repeatedly crossed ostensible Russian red lines—by providing advanced weapons to Ukraine, for example, or admitting Finland and Sweden into NATO—without Putin resorting to nuclear use or other major escalations. And yet, the notion persists, perhaps usefully to Putin, that he must not be forced on the ropes or he will unleash World War III.<br><br> Natalia Gevorkyan was one of three Russian journalists who spoke with Putin for the 2000 autobiographical interviews. She told me she doubts that the Russian leader deliberately planted the rat story as propaganda—at least in its initial telling. Putin didn&#39;t know in advance the questions the journalists would be asking, and he volunteered the anecdote only when they pressed him on whether the conditions at the communal apartment where he grew up were as horrible as a former teacher of his had suggested.<br><br> The Kremlin had encouraged Putin to “talk openly” about himself so that the interviews would introduce him to Russians who “didn&#39;t know anything about him” at the time, Gevorkyan said. Stories like the one about the rats seemed intended to fulfill that directive.<br><br> “Nobody was cornering him” back in 2000, Gevorkyan reasoned. “I don&#39;t believe that he was that smart to say, &#39;Look, guys, listen to this story and never push me into the corner.&#39;” She conceded that it&#39;s “quite possible” he has sent a political message by repeating the story and its lesson in the ensuing years.<br><br> But Gevorkyan, who is now based in Paris, did challenge the conventional interpretation of the story. She wonders why so many people ( <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/putins-way/transcript/?">herself included</a> , until she looked at the tale in a new light after Russia&#39;s assault against Ukraine last year) gravitate toward a convoluted reading of it that associates Putin with the dangerous rodent. The more straightforward moral of the story is that a frightened young Vladimir backed off when threatened, and that the elder Vladimir might do the same under similar circumstances. Something about the tale, she mused, tempts people to concentrate on the pouncing rat rather than the fleeing boy.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/putin-prigozhin-belarus/674523/">Read: Why Putin let Prigozhin go</a><br><br> Putin had a stick that he could have used to protect himself against the much smaller animal. Instead, Gevorkyan said, “he runs away and he hides in his own apartment and he feels safe. For me, this is much more a story about Putin than about the rat.”<br><br> No one but Putin himself will ever know for sure if, when push comes to shove, he is the cornered rat, the frightened boy, or something else entirely. But policy makers and the public can pay particularly close attention to what Putin <em>does</em> rather than what he says or what others say about him, and build their understanding of the Russian leader on a foundation of empirical evidence. They can avoid the siren song of popular frameworks that offer simplistic explanatory models for a complicated geopolitical actor. They can design policies and strategies to defend their interests that factor in their best assessments of Putin, while not accepting as gospel any single measure of the man and how he might behave.<br><br> Aleksandar Matovski, an assistant professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/book/33649/chapter-abstract/288181474?redirectedFrom=fulltext">has studied</a> the connection between Putin&#39;s military adventurism abroad and his political standing at home. He told me that he sees some limited but significant truth in the cornered-rat paradigm: “There is a genuine threshold at which cornered Putin (in the sense of losing his grip domestically) would lash out aggressively, as a fall from power for a personalized dictator like him would be catastrophic,” he wrote to me, noting that his comments constitute his own assessment and not the position of the US Department of Defense. But he also underscored the evidence that has piled up against the paradigm. Putin has “exploited the fear of the &#39;cornered rat&#39; as a sort of bluff, particularly through nuclear blackmail in recent years,” he observed.<br><br> To avoid a situation in which a weakened Putin in dire circumstances blunders into nuclear use, Matovski argued, Western officials will need “to appeal to the survivalist outlook of Putin and his elite by signaling determination to retaliate in ways that will deny the Kremlin the benefits of a nuclear strike” and exert painful pressure on the Putin regime.<br><br> In other words, to manage the risk of nuclear escalation with Russia, they shouldn&#39;t dismiss offhand the man who once saw in a cornered rat a warning about the dangers of desperation. But they should nevertheless appeal to the survival instincts of the boy with the stick who, when faced with those dangers, decided to run for it.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/putin-russia-ukraine-war-cornered-rat-story/674890/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/putin-russia-ukraine-war-cornered-rat-story/674890/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[An Unsettling Hint at How Much Fraud Could Exist in Science]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Two experts on dishonesty are separately accused of tampering with data for the same research paper.

Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> <small><em>Updated at 5:24 pm ET on August 2, 2023</em></small><br><br> Two years ago, an influential 2012 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1209746109">study</a> of dishonesty co-authored by the social psychologist and best-selling author Dan Ariely came under scrutiny. A group of scientists argued on their blog that some of the underlying data—describing the numbers of miles that a car-insurance company&#39;s customers reported having driven—had been faked, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://datacolada.org/98">beyond any shadow of a doubt</a> .” The academic <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1209746109">paper</a> featuring that study, which described three separate experiments and had five co-authors in all, was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115397118">retracted</a> not long after. At the time, Ariely said that the figures in question had been shared with him by the insurance company, and that he had no idea they might be wrong: “I can see why it is tempting to think that I had something to do with creating the data in a fraudulent way,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/dan-ariely-honesty-study-retraction">he told <em>BuzzFeed</em></a> , “but I didn&#39;t.”<br><br> Had the doctoring been done by someone from the insurer, as Ariely implied? There didn&#39;t seem to be a way to dispute that contention, and the company itself wasn&#39;t saying much. Then, last week, NPR&#39;s <em>Planet Money</em> delivered a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/27/1190568472/dan-ariely-francesca-gino-harvard-dishonesty-fabricated-data">scoop</a> : The company, called The Hartford, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=23888902-the-hartford-statement-to-nick-fountai">informed the show</a> that it had finally tracked down the raw numbers that were provided to Ariely—and that the data had been “manipulated inappropriately” in the published study. Reached by NPR, Ariely once again denied committing fraud. “Getting the data file was the extent of my involvement with the data,” he said.<br><br> That an expert on dishonesty would be accused of dishonesty was already notable. Paired with last month&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/24/business/economy/francesca-gino-harvard-dishonesty.html">allegations</a> that the Harvard Business School professor Francesca Gino—who also studies lying and is a frequent co-author of Ariely&#39;s—is associated with falsified data for <em>the</em> <em>very same</em> <em>2012 paper</em> , it&#39;s downright bizarre. The analysis of insurance data from The Hartford appeared as “Experiment 3” in the paper. On the preceding page, an analysis of a different dataset—the one linked to Gino—was written up as “Experiment 1.” The scientists who say they discovered issues with both experiments—Leif Nelson, Uri Simonsohn, and Joe Simmons—dubbed the apparent double fraud a “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://datacolada.org/109">clusterfake</a> .” When I spoke with the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/ivermectin-research-problems/620473/">scientific-misconduct investigator</a> and <em>Atlantic</em> contributor James Heathers, he had his own way of describing it: “This is some kind of mad, fraudulent unicorn.”<br><br> Given reports ( <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://joebakcoleman.com/blog/2023/Harvard/">contested</a> as they may be) that such an extraordinary beast exists, certain questions arise. For example, if the fraud is real, could this be a case of data-tampering in cahoots, or might it be nothing more than an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/francesca-gino-harvard-research-retraction/674630/">odd and ironic</a> coincidence? When I reached out to Ariely, he said he has never engaged in any research misconduct. “For more than 25 years and alongside dozens of esteemed colleagues and collaborators, I have conducted research that has resulted in more than 100 peer-reviewed papers,” he told me via email. “To be explicitly clear, I have never manipulated or misrepresented data in any of my work and have never knowingly participated in any project where the data or conclusions were manipulated or misrepresented.” Gino initially declined requests for comment. Since this article&#39;s publication, her attorneys have filed a $25 million lawsuit alleging defamation against Harvard University, Nelson, Simonsohn, and Simmons; and Gino posted a new <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/francescagino_i-want-to-be-very-clear-i-have-never-ever-activity-7092615706931789825-poii">statement</a> on LinkedIn. “I want to be very clear: I have never, ever falsified data or engaged in research misconduct of any kind,” it says.<br><br> If the mad, fraudulent unicorn is real—if two different scientists really did fabricate data for separate experiments that were published in the same paper—the scenario might well be unprecedented. Neither Heathers nor any other experts I spoke with could recall a single example of this kind. (Ivan Oransky, the editor in chief of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/"><em>Spectrum</em></a> and a co-founder of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/">Retraction Watch</a> , told me that he thinks it has happened in the past, but he couldn&#39;t recall anything specific.) If the 2012 paper on dishonesty does represent a case of coordinated misconduct, that would certainly be unnerving. But there&#39;s no evidence it does, and a coincidental, overlapping fraud would, in a way, be cause for even greater concern. It suggests that scientific fraud is <em>much</em> more common than the number of known cases might lead one to believe.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/francesca-gino-harvard-research-retraction/674630/">Read: The Harvard expert on dishonesty who is accused of lying</a><br><br> The actual rate of scientific fraud writ large is mysterious, but there are some clues. One laborious review of more than 20,000 biomedical research papers found that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4941872/">3.8 percent</a> contained images with “problematic” data, more than half of which showed signs of “deliberate manipulation.” And according to a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685008/">meta-analysis</a> of 18 anonymous survey-studies conducted from 1985 to 2005, just under 2 percent of scientists admit to having fabricated, falsified, or modified data. That said, one can hardly expect <em>every</em> fraudster to self-identify as such, even anonymously. Why contribute to a result that could promote greater scrutiny of behavior like your own?<br><br> Further data on the problem are hard to come by, in large part because scientists rarely look for fraud in a systematic way, Heathers said. Nelson, one of the three psychologists who reported finding signs of tampering in the studies from the 2012 paper, told me that even delving into data from a single paper can be very time-intensive. His group, which investigates suspicious research for a blog called Data Colada, does this work not on behalf of any formal body, but rather as a sort of pro bono side hustle. (The Data Colada contributor Simonsohn co-authored a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612459762">paper</a> with Gino in 2013.)<br><br> The lack of interest from scientific institutions in identifying fraud has both led to and been reinforced by some starry-eyed assumptions, said Nick Brown, a psychologist whose own investigations of suspect research have led to numerous <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/meet-data-thugs-out-expose-shoddy-and-questionable-research">corrections and retractions</a> . “There seems to be this idea that once you have a Ph.D., you are somehow a saint,” he told me. Then evidence of scientific misconduct emerges, and people act as though the unthinkable has happened.<br><br> A more skeptical posture has served Brown well in his own work as a data detective, as it has for the scientists behind Data Colada. When they set about reviewing Ariely&#39;s work on the 2012 paper, a few quirks in the car-insurance data tipped them off that something might be amiss. Some entries were in one font, some in another. Some were rounded to the nearest 500 or 1,000; some were not. But the detail that really caught their attention was the distribution of recorded values. With such a dataset, you&#39;d expect to see the numbers fall in a bell curve—most entries bunched up near the mean, and the rest dispersed along the tapering extremes. But the data that Ariely said he&#39;d gotten from the insurance company did not form a bell curve; the distribution was completely flat. Clients were just as likely to have claimed that they&#39;d driven 1,000 miles as 10,000 or 50,000 miles. It&#39;s “hard to know what the distribution of miles driven should look like in those data,” the scientists wrote. “It is not hard, however, to know what it should not look like.”<br><br> One can apply a sort of mirror-image reasoning to the possibility of a double fraud in the dishonesty paper. The numbers of miles driven didn&#39;t look the way the scientists assumed they should, so the scientists concluded that the data had been faked. Similarly, the number of fishy datasets in a single published paper doesn&#39;t really fit with expectations. But in the latter case, it would be our assumptions that are off. If fraud is really very rare—if, say, less than 2 percent of scientists ever committed it even once in their careers—then an overlap in 2012 would be an implausible anomaly. But imagine that scientific misbehavior is a good deal more common than is generally acknowledged: If that&#39;s the case, then “clusterfakes” might not be so unusual. Mad, fraudulent unicorns could be everywhere, just waiting to be found.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 15:39:48 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/gino-ariely-data-fraud-allegations/674891/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/gino-ariely-data-fraud-allegations/674891/</item><item><title><![CDATA[We’re Gambling With the Only Good Oceans in the Universe]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Earth&#39;s precious water made life possible.

For weeks, surface temperatures hovered around 90 degrees Fahrenheit, before <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/florida-water-heat-wave-ocean-climate-2f0a1eb529aba9f17ee88a04cda7df42">dropping</a> to the 80s last week. The world&#39;s third-largest barrier reef is dying, and scientists are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/climate/coral-reefs-heat-florida-ocean-temperatures.html">fishing out coral samples</a> and bringing them to the cool safety of laboratory tanks. One spot along the coastline hit triple-digit temperatures last month, conditions you would expect inside a hot tub. Some coastal Floridians skipped their usual dips in the ocean because it didn&#39;t seem appealing anymore.<br><br> Marine heat waves—periods of persistent and anomalously high temperatures of surface seawater—have materialized in other parts of the world too. The surface temperatures of about 44 percent of Earth&#39;s oceans are currently experiencing extreme heat, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psl.noaa.gov/marine-heatwaves/#report">according</a> to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Some of that warming is to be expected, because 2023 is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-la-nina-el-nino.html">an El Niño year</a> . But “all of these marine heat waves are made warmer because of climate change,” Dillon Amaya, a research scientist at NOAA&#39;s Physical Sciences Laboratory, told me. June was already a record-breaking month for the world&#39;s oceans, and then July came along and topped it. According to the experimental forecast system that Amaya and his colleagues run at NOAA, half of the world&#39;s oceans may be in the throes of a heat wave by September.<br><br> Earth is an ocean planet, a water world. We have not observed anything like it yet in the universe, not even with our best telescopes, and so we cannot know exactly how rare—and thus, how difficult—it may be for the forces of cosmic nature to produce such a thing. And yet, here we are, simmering its oceans at our peril and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/climate/atlantic-ocean-tipping-point.html">changing the fundamental makeup</a> of the ecosystem that defines Earth. Our oceans have absorbed most of the excess heat produced by greenhouse-gas emissions in recent decades, serving as a buffer that protects us from the worst effects of climate change. Humans may be sweltering on land this summer, but our planet&#39;s future—and therefore ours—is intimately tied with the sea.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/climate-change-heat-waves-ocean-sea-level-rise/674676/">Read: Boiling the ocean</a><br><br> Astronomers have spent years searching for worlds beyond our solar system that might host oceans, in the hopes that they also host life. Of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/03/nasa-exoplanets-habitable-zone/627155/">more than 5,000 planets</a> they&#39;ve found, only a few are in the habitable zone—at the right distance from their star to be conducive to liquid, flowing water. And scientists have yet to confirm that any rocky, Earth-size planets are also wet. Part of the problem is that oceans are difficult to detect with the technology available to researchers today. Our planet may be slick with rolling seas, but “if we were to observe Earth as an exoplanet, from a different system, we could not measure that Earth has water,” Charles Cadieux, an astronomer at the University of Montreal, told me.<br><br> Other oceans exist in our very own solar system but are hidden beneath the surface of icy moons, their exact composition unknown to us. Krista Soderlund, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, studies Europa, a moon of Jupiter with a salty subsurface ocean that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/10/jupiter-moon-europa-ocean-life-forms-nasa-clipper-mission/671671/">could harbor microbial life</a> ; she spends her days marveling at this other ocean world, all while worrying about the one she lives on. “I don&#39;t really have a way to reconcile that,” Soderlund told me. “You can see the short, rapid changes right now, and then I&#39;m looking forward to how that&#39;s going to affect my kids. How much worse is it going to be?”<br><br> Next year, NASA is scheduled to launch the mission that Soderlund is working on: a spacecraft that will reach Europa in 2030. The vessel will carry a plaque engraved with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://europa.nasa.gov/message-in-a-bottle/sign-on/">a poem</a> written by the US poet laureate, which reads in part, “O second moon, we, too, are made / of water, of vast and beckoning seas.” This idea of connection, a touch of intimacy in an unfamiliar cosmos, is lovely. Read another way, it sounds almost like an elegy. We <em>are</em> made of vast seas. But when those seas are superheated, dissolving <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/climate-weather/ocean-warming/">the shells and skeletons</a> of marine creatures and enabling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://climateadapt.ucsd.edu/faq-californias-marine-heatwaves/">toxic blooms of algae</a> , they beg for relief more than they beckon.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/09/ipcc-sea-level-rise-report/598765/">Read: The oceans we know won&#39;t survive climate change</a><br><br> Our planet did not start out with seas. They came later, after Earth had cooled down from its formative molten years. How Earth got its water remains an open question; some researchers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://epl.carnegiescience.edu/news/where-did-earths-water-come">believe</a> that it arrived inside asteroids that bombarded Earth several billion years ago, while others <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nautil.us/where-earth-got-its-water-309914/">suggest</a> that it was locked within the planet since it first formed out of the mountain-size rocks whizzing around the early solar system. This September, a NASA spacecraft will bring home samples from an asteroid that has remained unchanged since that cosmic period, and the rocky bits and pieces could reveal crucial information about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/10/asteroids-bennu-nasa/616787/">our very existence</a> . Scientists hope to uncover clues about the forces that gave rise to Earth&#39;s oceans and enriched them with the chemical compounds that eventually sparked life.<br><br> In the face of climate change, the thrill of discovery is tinged with melancholy; as we learn more about how our ocean planet came to be, we&#39;re subjecting its waters to intense heat, and the entire planet is facing the consequences.

This is global warming, they say, and it&#39;s plenty dramatic. Still, <em>boiling</em> can help emphasize the visceral urgency of what&#39;s happening in the water. Because it is getting more difficult each day to look around and feel that things here are <em>just right</em> .<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 15:24:50 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/marine-heat-waves-earth-climate-change/674892/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/marine-heat-waves-earth-climate-change/674892/</item></channel></rss>
