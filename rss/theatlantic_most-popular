年最大的对决——学校和会议的长期利益与他们自己永不满足的贪婪之间的对决。<br><br>当足球界的主要力量从一个联盟转向另一个联盟时——扰乱现有的竞争，转而支持球迷不太熟悉的新对手——这总是会引起争议。但最近的许多会议变化已经将格局打乱到了不同寻常的程度。人们普遍抱怨大学球员新发现的从代言交易中获利的能力正在损害一项所谓的业余运动，而真正将大学橄榄球撕成碎片的是学校和会议的贪婪推动的会议重组。<br><br>目前，最大的麻烦迹象是，在 NCAA 第一级橄榄球碗分区争夺转播收入的大规模争夺中，太平洋十二校联盟 (Pac-12) 正在被彻底摧毁。久负盛名的西海岸联盟一直<a data-event-element="inline link"

(Pac-12) 征战十多年后重返 Big 12，这对后者来说是又一次打击。<br><br>如此多的学校纷纷采取行动的原因是，会议的每个成员都能获得其保证的电视收入的一部分。因此，交易规模越大，每所学校的拨款就越大。目前，十大联盟和东南联盟（SEC）拥有大学橄榄球领域最赚钱的电视转播合同。拥有 ESPN 的迪士尼在 2020 年成功获得了 SEC 的所有媒体版权，并<a

Pac-12 并不是唯一面临严峻现实的会议。据<em>《体育</em><em>画报》</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.si.com/college/2023/05/17/acc-florida-state-clemson-leaving-what-happens-next">报道</a>，至少一半的大西洋海岸联盟

（与十大联盟或美国证券交易委员会成员学校签约是运动员在电视上露脸的好方法。）这些考虑激怒了大学橄榄球传统主义者，他们据说想要维护学生运动员的旧理想。<br><br> “我反对任何贬低教育价值的行为，”克莱姆森大学橄榄球教练达博·斯温尼去年<a data-event-element="inline link"

“即使是遥远地想象，五年前，太平洋十二校联盟 (Pac-12)

规定中欧大学在布达佩斯校区提供美国认可的学位为非法，那里的每个人都知道这不仅仅是对匈牙利裔美国商人乔治·索罗斯 (George Soros) 的攻击也是 CEU 创始人的慈善家。我当时是该大学的校长和校长，从 2016 年到 2021 年担任该职位，所以我亲眼目睹了几周后的一个周日，超过 50,000 名布达佩斯公民游行经过我们的窗户，捍卫我们的学术自由。他们高呼“ <i>Szabad orszag, szabad egyetem</i> ”（“自由国家，自由大学”），知道他们的自由也受到威胁。自2010年上台以来，欧尔班削弱了该国最高法院，重写了匈牙利宪法，从根本上限制了新闻自由，并污蔑了外国对其公民社会组织的捐款。高喊口号的人群知道，对大学的袭击是巩固一党独裁统治的又一步。<br><br>欧尔班反对大学的运动并没有随着中欧大学的成立而结束。首先，他砍掉了匈牙利最杰出的科学机构——科学院，剥夺了它的独立研究机构。然后，他强迫匈牙利自己的大学系统的很大一部分私有化，在其董事会中塞满了党派忠诚者，并向马蒂亚斯·科维努斯学院投入资源，这是一个新的精英机构，其明确的任务是为匈牙利精英提供传统的爱国教育明天的。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/06/george-soros-viktor-orban-ceu/588070/">摘自 2019 年 6 月号：欧尔班·维克多 (Viktor Orbán) 的智力战争</a><br><br>一个更大的地缘战略调整项目正在这里进行。在抛弃了美国认可的机构后，欧尔班试图通过向复旦大学提供位于多瑙河的校园来取代它。复旦大学是一家总部位于上海的机构，最近在其章程中承认了中国共产党的领导作用。他还采取措施进一步远离北约和欧盟。<br><br> 1989 年，作为一名年轻的民主活动家，欧尔班是最早呼吁从匈牙利遣返苏联军队的人之一。三十年后，他因亲俄立场而成为北约和欧盟成员国领导人中的异类。欧尔班迟迟没有谴责总统弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)入侵乌克兰的行为，但他敦促乌克兰人寻求和平协议，并禁止通过匈牙利边境运送有助于乌克兰战争的武器。<br><br>特朗普政府及其驻布达佩斯大使并没有对欧尔班向独裁者求爱或驱逐一所获得美国认证的高等教育机构犹豫不决，而是只是象征性地抵制了对中欧大学的攻击，这似乎是基于索罗斯的任何敌人都必须采取的原则。成为他们的朋友。 2019年以来，外国保守派纷纷涌入布达佩斯拜倒在匈牙利大师脚下。他们中的一些人，比如加拿大前总理斯蒂芬·哈珀，似乎很天真。表面上寻求右翼政党之间更密切的国际联系，他们似乎想相信，像他们一样，他是一个宪政保守派——而事实上，他是一党制国家的独裁老板。<br><br>其他人确切地知道他是谁，这就是吸引他们的地方：他的专制男子气概。欧尔班法院的美国恳求者名单包括迈克·彭斯和塔克·卡尔森等政治人物，以及罗德·德雷尔、克里斯托弗·鲁福和帕特里克·德宁等右翼知识分子。美国保守党政治行动会议已在布达佩斯举行了一次会议，欧尔班去年受邀在达拉斯举行的该会议上担任主旨发言人。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/05/bernard-henri-levy-interviews-viktor-orban/589102/">伯纳德·亨利·莱维：反极权主义激进分子如何发现极端民族主义</a><br><br>美国保守派并不是唯一关注布达佩斯音乐的人。欧尔班对匈牙利自由主义制度的系统性瓦解使他成为全球民族保守运动的名义领袖，该运动目前包括意大利的乔治亚·梅洛尼、法国的马琳·勒庞、西班牙之声党的圣地亚哥·阿巴斯卡、波兰法律党的雅罗斯瓦夫·卡钦斯基正义党、以色列利库德集团的本杰明·内塔尼亚胡、极右翼的瑞典民主党，以及现在美国的 MAGA 共和党。这些右翼民粹主义者中的每一个都从欧尔班的菜单中获取他们喜欢的东西。其成分包括自由主义者统治世界的幻想理论、否认同性恋男女在家庭中占有一席之地的价值观运动，以及将公共资产转移给党内人士的保护主义经济政策。除了废除制衡的一党统治之外，还有一种将所有反对者都定义为国家敌人的政治，以及一种将学校和大学视为控制子孙后代的关键战场的文化斗争愿景。<br><br>总而言之，这为 21 世纪的保守派调制了一杯令人陶醉的鸡尾酒。欧尔班宣称，保守派的任务无非是扭转西方的衰落。时间已经晚了。无神论的自由主义、享乐主义、放纵主义和世界主义已经完成了致命的工作。颓废已经到了晚期。在 7 月的一次聚会上，他怒吼道：“今天，‘西方价值观’意味着三件事：移民、LGBTQ 和战争。”西方价值观可能还包括帮助民主国家击退入侵的想法对于欧尔班来说是陌生的，对于一些极右翼的美国保守派来说也是如此。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">德国人有</span>一个词来形容这一点： <i>Kulturkampf</i> 。欧尔班对美国保守派的吸引力在于，他将政治理解为争夺文化霸权的斗争。认为美国保守派成为意大利马克思主义者安东尼奥·葛兰西的追随者可能很奇怪，葛兰西将赢得霸权作为其政治战略概念的核心，但他们都认为大学是影响力的轴心。他们相信，谁拥有文化霸权，谁就能获得政治霸权。<br><br>顺便说一句，这是一个牵强的想法。在美国这样一个极其多样化和分裂的国家，有谁，无论政治倾向如何，有希望行使文化霸权吗？然而，文化霸权的目标似乎是州长罗恩·德桑蒂斯集中精力控制佛罗里达州教育系统的原因；重写黑人研究和其他科目的学校课程；解雇多元化、公平和包容官员；并赋予大学受托人审查和解雇国家系统中终身教授的权力。这也解释了德桑蒂斯对他最近收购的新学院的重视，新学院是萨拉索塔一所受人尊敬但鲜为人知的文科机构。一月份，他任命了董事会成员，任命了新的管理团队，并解雇了总统——所有这些都是为了将​​这个机构重塑为基督教保守派堡垒，以对抗“觉醒”意识形态。<br><br>为什么共和党总统候选人会浪费政治资本来撼动一所小型文理学院，大学的课程和管理如何成为争夺美国灵魂的另一个战场？与似乎不太关心这些问题的前总统唐纳德·特朗普不同，德桑蒂斯似乎痴迷于控制这个行业——把一切都押在这场文化霸权的斗争上。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/05/ron-desantis-florida-state-politics-gop/673489/">摘自 2023 年 5 月号：美国最奇怪、最痴迷自由的州是如何落入独裁州长之手的？</a><br><br>从这一点来说，他是欧尔班的弟子。在布达佩斯，CEU 是一所小型的、以研究为导向的社会科学和人文研究生院——你可能会认为，这对欧尔班政权来说算不上是眼中钉。但这会误解欧尔班如何看待我们。对他来说，我们的大学是他努力将自己塑造成保守文化斗士、反击自由世界主义所谓的触手影响的努力的一个有价值的象征性目标。一旦大学以这种方式构建，它们就会对自我推销的煽动者产生不可抗拒的吸引力。<br><br>大学还有另一个重要特征：它们很容易受到民粹主义的攻击。佛罗里达州的新学院是一所小型机构，当然拥有忠实的校友，但几乎没有政治影响力。这种机构会让斯大林调皮地问，<i>它有多少个部门？</i> CEU 也是如此。它拥有一些文化资本，就像乔治·索罗斯在东欧的流亡遗产一样，但欧尔班意识到，CEU 作为一个在外国运营的小型美国认可机构，其校友基础不断增长但规模不大，是一只坐鸭子。这些煽动者太聪明了，不会与与他们同等大小的人发生冲突。<br><br>对于这类右翼民粹主义者来说，攻击学院和大学也激起了从未上过大学的人们的怨恨，他们可能不喜欢大学学位可以赋予其受益人的权利，这通常是公正的。如果特朗普时代的共和党选民的重要组成部分可能是高中未毕业的人，那么对大学的攻击纯粹是煽动者的利己主义。同样，对于这些愤怒的选民来说，这种攻击的负面影响——削弱大学所带来的科学、技术和文化创新——并没有多大影响。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/viktor-orban-american-conservatism-admiration/671205/">雅各布·海尔布伦（Jacob Heilbrunn）：美国右翼对欧尔班·维克多（Viktor Orbán）着迷的背后</a><br><br>最后，或许也是最重要的一点，<i>文化斗争</i>对大学的攻击既是定义性的（从领袖品牌的意义上来说）也是转移注意力的。如果一位领导人认真解决被排除在外的选民群体的不满情绪，他根本不会关注大学。相反，他会认真审视企业的力量、它们的税率和避税，以及它们的工作外包，更不用说它们对数字公共领域的压倒性控制。这位领导人会关注最富有公民的收入，看看可以采取哪些措施将部分财富转移到改善学校、医院、诊所和其他公共设施上，为人们，特别是那些没有受过大学教育的人，提供公平的开始。生活。但针对大学和他们所谓的受宠爱的自由派教授比解决资助他的竞选活动的企业捐助者阶级的额外津贴和权力要容易得多。<br><br>欧尔班是这种转移政治注意力的大师，他乐于迎合自由派对他攻击学术自由的谴责，同时耐心地继续他的核心业务——利用国家权力为他的支持者致富。他曾经向我的一位银行家朋友坦言，他有很多人要养活：他知道，​​正如普京和土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安等其他独裁者一样，养活朋友是独裁者保住权力的方式。<br><br>在欧尔班·维克托开始反对 CEU 的运动<span class="smallcaps">六年后</span>，效仿他的保守派已经意识到，把大学当作敌人是多么方便。这些对大学自治和学术自由的攻击——在美国各州、在纳伦德拉·莫迪领导下的印度和在埃尔多安领导下的土耳其——主要是为了一件事：系统性地削弱任何可能成为独裁权力障碍的机构。尽管美国保守派与国外的独裁派一样，一贯用伪民主的术语来描述他们对大学的攻击——试图保护沉默的大多数免受自由派精英的意识形态威胁——但他们的真正议程是削弱民主制衡。<br><br>大学通常不被理解，更很少被捍卫为防止民主屈服于多数人暴政的护栏机构，但这就是大学的作用之一：测试、批评和验证公民用来创造知识的知识。关于谁应该统治他们的决定。因为这是大学的民主理由，所以对于那些想要捍卫大学的人来说，信息应该是明确的。只要学术自由被视为自由派精英的特权，它就没有学术界以外的支持者。自由主义者应该捍卫学术自由，不是将其视为职业特权，也不是将大学视为进步观点的堡垒，而是因为大学——就像法院、自由新闻界和独立监管机构——是对多数人统治的基本限制，而多数人统治使我们所有人都享有自由。这正是布达佩斯公民在走过 CEU 大门时所理解的，高呼“自由国家，自由大学”。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 06 Aug 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

OPRAH（ <em>《纽约时报》</em> 2019 年拼图中的“Harpo Productions 创始人”）、WHO GOES THERE（2018 年的“哨兵查询”）和 BANANA SPLIT（“甜点”）在船上服务，”根据 2022 年的条目）。<br><br>但填字游戏解谜者轻松熟悉规则的真正标志是知道什么是<em>糟糕的</em>答案，例如 SUPERB PAN（“煎培根的好东西”）或 ORDER A RYE（“威士忌爱好者会在酒吧做什么”） ）。这些无用的东西来自 Trip Payne 的作品，Trip Payne 是一位填字游戏构建者和快速解题者，以其荒诞的“布谷鸟填字游戏”而闻名。佩恩的布谷鸟填字游戏（故意）充满了如此滑稽怪异的条目，以至于解谜者会同意它们在典型的谜题中没有位置。 2021 年的一个谜题包含线索“‘原钻’片场的虚荣心。”答案：亚当·桑德勒的自我。<br><br>尽管像 SAFE AND 这样的条目会藐视英语的基本规则，但 Cuckoo Crosswords 中的 cuckoo 条目却藐视了填字游戏中更微妙（如果同样重要）的规则。在这两种情况下，填字游戏解决者都通过经验了解到什么使给定的条目可以接受或布谷鸟，以及什么使某些条目真正伟大。尽管这些规则是填字游戏所特有的，但它们依赖于更普遍的语言直觉——关于你大脑中来之不易的语言知识，尽管你可能从未有意识地思考过它。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/calebs-inferno-crossword-puzzle/">玩：迦勒的地狱填字游戏</a><br><br>像 ADAM SANDLER&#39;S EGO 这样的 Cuckoo 答案是完全有效的英语短语，可以很容易地替换句子中的线索，结构上与 PANDORA&#39;S BOX 或 ACHILLES&#39; HEEL 等更容易接受的条目相同。然而，由于难以言喻的原因，它们仍然不能令人满意。填字游戏构造函数为如下答案起了一个名字：ADAM SANDLER&#39;S EGO、SUPERB PAN 和 ORDER A RYE 都是“绿色油漆条目”——就像答案“绿色油漆”本身一样。<br><br>一些填字游戏专家认为，绿色油漆条目会令解题者感到厌烦，因为它们在普通语言中太罕见了。但如果你在日常生活中遇到<em>“点一杯黑麦”</em> （“你好，我想点一杯黑麦”），你不会三思而后行——事实上，根据你的兴趣，你听到这句话的可能性比完全可以接受的条目，例如 APSE。 “订购一杯黑麦”被主流填字游戏社会禁止的真正原因与所有人类语言的一个称为“组合性”的特征有关：将较小的含义组合成具有可预测含义的较大含义的能力。组合性可以让你理解多词短语（<em>绿色油漆</em>是绿色的油漆）以及你以前从未听过的句子，例如“Lady Gaga 用绿色油漆泼洒了填字游戏网格”。<br><br>组合性是人类语言的基石，让我们用有限的单词表达无限的想法。然而，对于填字游戏求解器来说，纯粹组合的短语往往会令人失望。像“GREEN PAINT”这样的答案并不令人满意，因为除了将这两个词融合在一起所获得的含义之外，它没有太多意义。相比之下，好的多词答案在某种程度上大于各个部分的总和。将 GREEN PAINT 与 GREEN DAY 进行比较（在 1996 年<em>《纽约时报》</em>的一个谜题中，由“与格莱美获奖专辑‘Dookie’组成的乐队”找到线索），后者无论如何都不是指绿色的一天。语言学家称这样的短语为“非组合性”，因为你必须了解它们作为短语的含义——仅仅通过组合各个部分是无法获得整体的含义的。<br><br>与填字游戏不同，组合性并不是非黑即白的：短语可以是完全组合性的、完全非组合性的，也可以是介于两者之间的一切。考虑绿茶（ <em>《纽约时报》</em> 2003 年的一个谜题，“一杯寿司”）。它是茶，而且是绿色的（有点）。但了解这两个事实并不能告诉您有关绿茶的所有信息。它也有独特的品味、自己的历史、自己的共鸣。在红茶中加入绿色食用色素可能会将其变成绿茶，但不会使其成为绿茶。<br><br>对于填字游戏答案，相同的逻辑也适用于单个单词。诸如 REBROIL（ <em>re</em> plus <em>broil</em> ，大概意思是“再次烤”）之类的纯粹组合答案比 RETURN 这样的词更容易引起求解者的愤怒。尽管<em>return</em>和<em>rebroil</em>一样，是由片段（ <em>re</em>和<em>turn</em> ）组成的，但它的含义并不完全由这些片段的含义单独决定：返回不仅仅是再次翻转的行为。<br><br>对于一个真正出色的填字游戏答案来说，它应该像普鲁斯特的玛德琳蛋糕一样，唤起特定的时间、地点或环境。这就是为什么完全组合的答案往往会失败：如果一个单词或短语是当场组成的，它就没有机会做到这一点。您可能与 REBROIL 或 GREEN PAINT 没有特别的联系，因为它们没有自己的生命。但最喜欢的甜点（融化的巧克力蛋糕）或艺术家（蒂娜·特纳）或技术（MACBOOK PRO）可能会唤起整个世界的先前经历。当我们遇到这些单词和短语时，我们会记住它们的现实生活背景，甚至它们的情感共鸣。<br><br>这种地方感可以为短语增添一层额外的乐趣，这些短语乍一看似乎没有任何意义或联想，除了通过组合单词所获得的意义或关联。以<em>《纽约时报》</em> 2022 年 Kameron Austin Collins 谜题中的“SO RANDOM”条目为例。就其本身而言，它的意思是“特别混乱”。但许多求解者都知道，这句话深深地体现了时代精神。 SO RANDOM 唤起了千禧一代的形象，也许是讽刺或谦虚地描述他们自己的行为，甚至可能是用<em>《独领风骚》</em>中角色的声音说话。这些假设得到了线索的进一步支持：“就像……到处都是。”与此同时，诸如“特别混乱”之类的答案将没有机会利用任何类型的文化背景。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/puzzling-art-print-crossword/674649/">阅读：谜题的艺术</a><br><br>近年来，新一波的构建者和编辑者拓宽了填字游戏寻找答案的文化背景。当今最受欢迎的填字游戏中包含的晦涩难懂的欧洲河流少于名人、典故和各行各业的语言片段。 “你的策展声音越多，网格中反映的世界就越多，”为<em>《纽约客》</em>构建谜题的纳坦·拉斯特（Natan Last）在给我们的信中写道。如今，这些策展人的声音包括朱莉安娜·帕奇（Juliana Pache）和内特·卡丁（Nate Cardin）和内特·卡丁（Nate Cardin）和内特·卡丁（Nate Cardin），朱莉安娜·帕奇（Juliana Pache）的黑色填字游戏让 MENTO 不再是硬糖，而是“后来影响了斯卡和雷鬼的牙买加民间音乐”，而内特·卡丁（Nate Cardin）和他的同事则经常强调 LGBTQ 主题。例如，克莱尔·里姆库斯 (Claire Rimkus) 和安德鲁·金斯利 (Andrew Kingsley) 设计的 2019 年谜题是围绕答案 AUTOSTRADDLE（一本酷儿女权主义在线杂志的名称）构建的。<br><br>填字游戏揭示了复杂的心理过程，不仅涉及将单词组合成短语，还涉及将字母组合成单词。与我们大多数书面语言的经验不同，填字游戏的答案是没有空格的，作为密集、互连的网格中的单个条目。一些很棒的填字游戏答案充分利用了这一事实。想象一下，您正在解决一个难题，并偶然发现了这两个六个字母、部分填充的条目之一：XG____ 或 ____DJ。任何求解器在看到这些奇怪的字母组合后，都会合理地认为他们一定是弄错了其中一个交叉词——毕竟，没有任何英语单词以<em>xg-</em>开头或以<em>-dj</em>结尾。但在这些情况下，答案 XGAMES（“明显拒绝对参与者进行药检的体育赛事”，来自 2022 年<em>《纽约时报》的</em>一个谜题）和 PBANDJ（“简称为午餐盒项目”，来自 2003 年）都完全符合网格。<br><br>因为语言处理是自动发生的，除非您正在解决填字游戏，否则您可能不会注意到 PBANDJ 当粉碎在一起时看起来非常奇怪。或者，就此而言，绿茶不仅仅是绿茶。也许这就是填字游戏如此吸引人的部分原因：它们为我们的语言直觉提供了一个新颖的游乐场。正如填写一个字母可以突然让我们努力回忆起来的答案变得显而易见一样，解决填字游戏可以打开一扇新的窗口，让我们了解我们头脑中已有的知识。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 06 Aug 2023

href="https://twitter.com/DanielleFong/status/1686439382142836737?s=20">飘逸摇滚戏剧</a>”世界中具有里程碑意义的夏天。两周前，在两篇未经同行评审的论文草稿中，韩国科学家声称发现了一种室温常压超导体，并描述了如何制造它。理论上，这种神奇的材料可以彻底改变我们的世界。它也<em>悬浮起来</em>。这一所谓的发现引起了网络轰动。研究人员和 DIY 爱好者都争先恐后地进行复制； <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/superconductor-claims-spark-investor-frenzy-scientists-are-skeptical-2023-08-03/">股票飙升</a>；互联网上议论纷纷。但<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/viral-new-superconductivity-claims-leave-many-scientists-skeptical/">物理学家敦促谨慎</a>：之前有关室温超导体的说法并未得到证实。到目前为止，复制的尝试<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02481-0">还没有成功</a>。整件事变成了一场非常书呆子的社交媒体马戏团。<br><br>如果你和我一样，一直生活在岩石下（而不是漂浮的那种），你可能不明白这里所说的意义。基本上，超导体是一种具有特殊性质的材料：电流以零电阻通过它，这意味着沿途没有能量损失。这是一个非常有价值的特性，因为当电力通过电线从发电厂传输到电子设备时，电阻是造成<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.inverse.com/science/superconductors-physicist-explains-resistance-free-electricity">大量浪费</a>的原因。<br><br>如今，超导体已经在特定领域发挥作用，例如医院核磁共振成像机就使用超导体，但这些超导体需要保持在极冷的温度下。这种新公布的材料（一种被称为 LK-99 的铅、氧、磷和铜的混合物）背后的一大亮点是，它<em>在室温下</em>可以无电阻地导电。这种材料将是一个科学奇迹，可以彻底重塑基础设施并节省无数能源。由于磁力的相互作用，超导体也可以悬浮。这里也有一些相当令人惊奇的应用，尽管只是理论上的：如果火车不是在轨道上运行，而是漂浮在水面上会怎样？<br><br>所提出的科学主张是非同寻常的，并且面临着很多<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/23820077/lk-99-superconductor-experts">怀疑</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2384782-room-temperature-superconductor-breakthrough-met-with-scepticism/">争议</a>。那么，公众和我们对物理学的理解（更不用说浮石了）又将如何呢？我采访了莱斯大学物理学和天文学教授道格拉斯·内特尔森（Douglas Natelson），讨论了物理学传播的利弊、他对新论文的分析，以及我们未来是否注定会出现更多的浮动摇滚戏剧。<br><br><em>为了清晰起见，我们的对话经过了浓缩和编辑。</em><br><br> <strong>Caroline Mimbs Nyce：</strong>我对这里更大的主题非常感兴趣：这是一个科学故事还是一个真正的技术故事？两者都是吗？<br><br><strong>道格拉斯·内特尔森（Douglas Natelson）：</strong>凝聚态物理学（材料物理学）是物理学的一个分支，它对你日常生活的影响实际上比整个物理学学科中的任何其他学科都大。我认为与黑洞和粒子物理学等相比，它受到了忽视。因此，从某种意义上说，很高兴看到这个领域的这个分支如此令人兴奋，因为凝聚态物质确实解释了为什么你和我能够在全国范围内通过电话交谈的所有技术。从更广泛的角度来看，它解释了为什么你现在不会从地板上掉下来，为什么固体是固体，以及诸如水如何沸腾和磁铁如何工作之类的事情。它确实支撑着你周围的一切。<br><br> <strong>Nyce：</strong>本周到底发生了什么？<br><br><strong>内特尔森：</strong>超导体无电阻地传递电流（直流电流）。烤面包机中的电线会发光，因为有电流流过它们并且它们具有电阻，因此它们就像加热器一样。如果有超导体，电阻为零。它不仅小，而且为​​零。 112 年前，人们在非常非常低的温度下发现了超导性。如果你能获得在室温下做到这一点的材料，那将是非常令人兴奋的。室温超导体具有适当的其他特性，对于电子、发电、电机等各种技术都非常有用。这些材料还完全排除磁场。当靠近磁铁放置时，它们可以悬浮。例如，人们谈论的技术是火车磁悬浮，您可以让火车漂浮在铁轨上方，而不是实际上在铁轨上的车轮上滚动。<br><br>因此，一些韩国人的预印本出现了，而且标题有些引人注目。他们声称发现了一种室温常压超导体。与过去的其他一些说法不同的是，这些人实际上确实提出了一个非常清晰的配方，说明他们在制造材料方面所做的事情。所以他们说，<em>我们采用这些起始材料并以这种方式烘烤它们，然后将它们磨碎并做其他事情</em>。他们几乎为我们提供了他们所说的一步一步的秘诀。很好的是他们真的出版了食谱；你可以想象某人是秘密的。<br><br>许多人已经采取行动，其中包括互联网上的一些业余爱好者。我认为我们会相对较快地知道一些更明确的事情。仅仅完成食谱上的内容就需要几天的时间。如果你想非常仔细地做，需要的时间会比这长一些。论文中的数字、图表、数据看起来很有趣。但你看得越多，你就越发现其中存在一些问题。报纸上有很多奇怪的事情——这正是其他人需要检查这些东西的原因。<br><br>此前曾有人声称存在奇异的超导性。它们发生的频率足够高，以至于有一个绰号：不明超导物体。那么，为什么这款产品会受到如此多的关注呢？我认为 Twitter——或者 X，或者无论我们如何称呼它——是一个巨大的放大器。在所有社交媒体出现之前，这种情况以一种普通的科学模式在后台进行，而公众只是没有意识到这一点。现在有了社交媒体，如果有人注意到它，他们基本上就可以拥有一个可以与数百万人交谈的扩音器。<br><br> <strong>Nyce：</strong>您对这种动态有何看法？<br><br><strong>内特尔森：</strong>有优点也有缺点。信息传播的速度非常快。我确实认为问题在于，没有专业知识的人无法区分应该注意的事情和不应该认真对待的事情。当半生不熟的事情最终被强烈放大时，情况就不妙了。我很担心那些对高温固态材料合成一无所知的人试图在炉子上煮这些东西。我只是担心你会伤害自己。<br><br><strong>尼斯：</strong> “别这么做。”这是你的官方推荐吗？<br><br><strong>内特尔森：</strong>我的官方建议是“不要在家尝试这个”，是的。<br><br> <strong>Nyce：</strong>在我看来，你对这一新发现的成功并不是非常乐观。<br><br><strong>内特尔森：</strong>我认为每个人都应该有适当程度的怀疑态度。当一群其他人制造这个东西并对其进行一系列仔细的测量时，我们会知道更多。需要指出的一件事是，没有人真正表现出真正的悬浮，而这个东西确实不与表面接触。你会看到所有这些东西都在倾斜，这很有趣，但它并不是真正漂浮的。<br><br><strong>尼斯：</strong>你提到之前也有过炒作周期——其他“不明超导物体”。<br><br> <strong>Natelson：</strong><em>炒作周期</em>这个词不太合适。此前还有其他关于室温超导的报道。然后在这些东西的经典模式中，它从未被真正复制。到目前为止，他们还没有成功。<br><br> <strong>Nyce：</strong>你认为我们注定会重复这种模式吗？<br><br> <strong>Natelson：</strong>我不确定我是否会使用这个短语。拥有这样的材料的终点是如此诱人，对吧？如果我们真的可以在室温下使用它，那就非常非常酷了。这太令人兴奋了，以至于总是有人在寻找它。如果你假设人们时不时地会犯错误，那么我想在某种程度上你总是会得到不准确的说法。但没有规定说超导物理现象不能在室温下发生。这就是为什么它如此令人兴奋。<br><br><strong>尼斯：</strong>如果新发现没有成为我们所希望的神奇超导体，我们是否应该感到厌倦？还是我们应该保持乐观？<br><br><strong>内特尔森：</strong>我反过来问你一个问题：有很多很多药物被提议作为潜在的癌症治疗方法。其中很多最终都不起作用。许多药物最初看起来非常令人兴奋，但后来它们并没有我们想象的那样有效。我们对此感到厌倦吗？<br><br>你需要尝试周期。你需要人们尝试这些事情才能取得进步。并非所有事情都一定能达到您想要的最终目标，但您总会学到一些东西。<br><br> <strong>Nyce：</strong>这次我们学到了什么？<br><br> <strong>Natelson：</strong>我认为现在谈论我们所了解到的情况还为时过早。<br><br><strong>尼斯：</strong>公平。<br><br><strong>内特尔森：</strong>我确实希望人们能保持粉末干燥一点。我希望没有专业知识的人不一定会大声发表声明。如果你看看推特和其他地方的科学家们，人们都会说一些警告的话，比如“这很有趣，但先别急着下结论。我们需要小心并检查这一点。”我所看到的媒体报道似乎是适当衡量的。<br><br>人们对材料感到兴奋真是太好了。我们很容易在一生中都没有真正思考过我们周围的物质有多么神奇。事实上，我们确实非常了解材料的特性，这是人类伟大的智力成就。我希望在经历了这一切之后，人们能够更加欣赏这一点。<br><br></div>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>马克电源/万能</figcaption></figure>1964年，<span class="smallcaps">当林登·B·约翰逊总统</span>宣布“向贫困无条件宣战”时，国家没有任何计算贫困人口的方法，甚至没有一个关于如何定义贫困的坚定概念。他的政府急忙想出一项衡量进展的措施。后来决定，该指标将是一个三口或三口以上的家庭维持餐桌上食物所需的最低收入乘以三（当时，食物占典型家庭预算的三分之一）。<br><br>收入是幸福感的重要指标之一，但它并不是唯一的指标：健康状况和社会流动性等因素也很重要。这就是为什么我们应该把关注点从贫困转向弱势。<i>劣势</i>是一个比<i>贫困</i>更有用的术语，因为我们不仅仅是在谈论收入，我们还试图捕捉一个人的生活机会受到多种环境阻碍的复杂性。<i>劣势</i>更准确，因为它意味着不公正。人们受到了不公平的阻碍。<br><br>劣势不能仅在个人或家庭层面上理解。得益于社会科学研究，我们现在知道，儿童的生活机会不仅受到他们的背景（不仅是收入和家庭环境，而且还受到他们的社区）的深刻影响，而不是他们的基因特征或他们所接受的医疗护理。<br><br>考虑到这一点，我们创建了所谓的深度弱势指数，它反映了两种传统的收入衡量标准（贫困率和“深度贫困率”，即收入低于贫困线一半的人），这是健康的两个标志（出生体重和预期寿命），以及在低收入家庭长大的儿童的社会流动率。我们使用该指数对美国大约 3,100 个县以及人口最多的 500 个城市进行了排名。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/06/how-to-end-extreme-child-poverty/618720/">摘自 2021 年 6 月号：消除极端贫困的简单方法</a><br><br>排名立即显示出明显的地理格局。第一个惊喜是，我们的指数中最弱势的地区主要是农村地区，尤其是对于那些一生研究城市贫困的教授来说。但它们并不符合美国乡村的刻板印象。尽管其中一些人以白人为主，但大多数人以黑人或西班牙裔为主。我们还可以看到，许多拥有大量美洲原住民人口的地方属于全国最弱势的地区。芝加哥、洛杉矶和纽约存在相当程度的贫困。但在我们的同类比较中，这些城市都没有跻身全国 600 个最贫困地区之列。该名单上唯一的城市是克利夫兰、底特律和罗切斯特等少数工业城市。<br><br>有人可能会说我们应该考虑到许多城市的高生活成本，但这比看起来更复杂。尽管在某些地方人们支付的住房费用更高，但他们也受益于良好的医疗保健系统、更慷慨的安全网、公共交通和更高质量的学校。生活在我们指数中 200 个最贫困地区的人们与生活在美国 500 个最大城市的人们一样，在支付住房费用方面可能遇到很大困难。<br><br>我们的指数确定的 200 个最弱势地区集中在三个地区：阿巴拉契亚、德克萨斯州南部和南部棉花带。 （除了那些拥有大量美洲原住民社区的县之外，没有一个西部县出现在名单上。）这些地方都有着密集的资源开采和人类剥削的历史，而这种程度在美国其他地方是不存在的。这种经济模式在每个地方都在 19 世纪末或 20 世纪初出现（或者说，就棉花带而言，完全繁荣）。在每个地方，都有一个行业主导经济，这种模式一直持续到 20 世纪 60 年代，当时棉花大王、烟草大王、煤炭大王和德克萨斯州南部的农业都屈服于自动化和全球竞争的双重力量。<br><br>如果我们非常迟钝或固执，就会忽略这样一个事实：这些地方类似于殖民地——美国境内的内部殖民地。使用<i>国家中的国家</i>或<i>殖民地</i>等术语来描述美国境内对有色人种社区的剥削美国在黑人学者和活动家中有着悠久的历史。在走访美国许多最贫困的地区时，我们开始通过历史研究、民族志观察和深入访谈来开展这项工作。<br><br>在阿巴拉契亚中部，我们开车穿过公司城镇的遗迹，许多城镇只有一两条街宽，还有山谷——在群山之间绵延数英里的狭窄山谷。我们来到肯塔基州克莱县，在内战之前这里是强大的盐业大亨和自给农场的所在地。内战后，大木材公司和大煤炭公司接手。如今，阿片类药物危机正在该地区肆虐。县城曼彻斯特的当地人哀叹电影院（现在是五旬节教堂）的衰落和保龄球馆的消失。众多的酒吧、咖啡馆和美容院；还有一个因高速公路建设项目而被铲平的公园。人们将阿片类药物使用的增加归咎于现在“除了毒品别无他法”。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/05/nikki-king-opioid-treatment-program/609085/">阅读：美国的另一种流行病</a><br><br>在德克萨斯州南部，菠菜和洋葱田曾经非常巨大，几乎在各个方向都遇到了天空的消失点，为土地所有者带来了巨额利润。然而，种植和收获这些农作物的无地劳动者却面临着难以想象的困难。几代人以来，德克萨斯州南部城镇的外观遵循着一种社会等级模式：坚固的木结构房屋、铺好的街道和白人社区的封闭下水道；墨西哥城镇部分的棚屋、土路和厕所。几代墨西哥裔美国儿童被迫在淡季期间移民寻找工作，失去了接受体面教育的权利。即使在今天，这些地方的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nces.ed.gov/surveys/piaac/skillsmap/">成人文盲率</a>仍然是全国最高的。<br><br>当我们到达典型的棉花带小镇的郊区时，田野被一排闪闪发光的白色战前房屋所取代，里面有大草坪、古老的树木和宏伟的入口，入口处有两三层楼高的柱子。这些地方表面上看起来很平静，但例如在密西西比州的勒弗洛尔县，黑人居民告诉我们，暴力是他们面临的第一个问题。那里的人际暴力死亡率几乎是全国平均水平的四倍，远高于芝加哥所在地伊利诺伊州库克县的死亡率。我们很快就会了解到，勒弗洛尔县及其所代表的更大地区——从卡罗莱纳州延伸到阿肯色州东部和路易斯安那州的广阔棉花带——确实是全国最危险的地区之一。<b> </b>这些地方有着悠久的暴力传统，并得到政府的接受和支持。几代人以来，它都是白人精英用来压迫美国黑人劳工的最有力工具。<br><br>在这些地区，我们看到相同的主题一次又一次出现——不平等的教育、社会基础设施的崩溃、暴力、根深蒂固的公共腐败以及政府计划中嵌入的结构性种族主义。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">探索深度劣势指数的另一</span>端——被确定为最大优势的地方——对我们的研究也至关重要。我们再一次对指数的走向感到惊讶。这里不是曼哈顿，也不是科技发达的西雅图。相反，该列表将我们指向中西部北部：明尼苏达州、达科他州、威斯康星州、内布拉斯加州和爱荷华州。总体而言，这些地方的贫困率非常低，婴儿出生时健康，人们活到耄耋之年，低收入儿童通常有与其他孩子相似的进入中产阶级的机会。<br><br>最具优势的县最初是拥有中等规模农场的农业社区，其中许多最初是通过 1862 年《宅地法案》获得的，该法案使土地所有权广泛存在。其中许多地方通过对学校进行大量投资，建立了基础广泛的财富历史，这促成了几代人的高毕业率和大学入学率。利用现有的最佳数据，我们发现他们的暴力犯罪率、收入不平等和公共腐败率是全国最低的。这些县的社会资本异常丰富：居民通过志愿服务、公民组织成员资格以及参与其他社区活动相互联系。<br><br>这些地方并非没有挑战。年轻大学毕业生的当地就业机会有时有限。然而，这些社区在预防贫困、促进健康和确保儿童享有公平的竞争环境方面比大多数社区更加成功。<br><br>如果不考虑历史上（和持续的）对移民劳工（大部分来自美国边境地区）的剥削，人们就无法完全理解在美国最有利的地方所享受到的好处。更重要的是，许多最有利的地方都毗邻土著民族，而这些地方往往属于最不利的地方。这些地方的历史深深地、不可逆转地交织在一起。我们参观了南达科他州布法罗县的克罗溪保留地，该保留地在我们的指数中排名第四。 1863 年，血腥的美达科他战争结束后，这里的居民被驱逐出明尼苏达州西南部的富饶土地。美洲原住民也有数百人丧生，其中一些是在战争中丧生，但大多数人在被强行迁移到几乎不适合人类居住的土地上后死于饥饿。<br><br>中西部北部地区也以白人为主。当我们检查白种人与指数排名之间的关系时，我们发现较高比例的白人居民是一个地方排名的重要预测因素，当人们认为好学校和好工作长期存在时，这并不奇怪。白人被慷慨地授予，而西班牙裔和美国黑人则被拒绝。<br><br>但种族并不像不平等程度、失业率或教育程度那样具有预测性。此外，许多白人比例过高的地方，如俄亥俄州、缅因州、伊利诺伊州、印第安纳州、蒙大拿州、密歇根州和爱达荷州，甚至没有跻身美国优势地区的前一半之列。最有优势的社区的独特之处在于它们作为广泛财富所在地的历史。如果该国其他地区采取类似、公平的做法，情况会有何不同？<br><br>教训是，当不平等程度较低时，人们似乎会蓬勃发展——并不总是在高薪方面，而是在健康和生活机会方面；当土地所有权普遍存在时；当社会关系较高时；当腐败和暴力很少发生时。中西部北部社区的社会等级特征不仅仅是一种奇特的文化特征。它是社区福祉的基础。在这些地区的优点在全国范围内共享之前，贫困和劣势将继续困扰美国。<br><br><small><em>本文改编自即将出版的新书<a

50 年。你摧毁了女孩与生俱来的自我价值感。”对于一个如此清晰地看到芭比娃娃缺陷的人来说，萨莎在做出正义的击倒时出人意料地情绪激动。当然，她是一个拒绝童心和玩具的青少年。当然，她是在向朋友们炫耀。但这种咆哮如此激烈，因为愤怒是真实的——因为，据我们所知，这是针对个人的：这是关于她母亲的。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">阅读：理解芭比电影的令人惊讶的关键</a><br><br>萨莎的母亲格洛丽亚后来在电影的中心独白中说道，虽然这在某种程度上是可以预见的，但“成为女人实际上是不可能的”。但和许多现代母亲一样，格洛丽亚在克服她所哀叹的悖论方面做了令人印象深刻的工作。她善良、漂亮，但仍然是“姐妹情谊”的一部分。当她的丈夫坐在家里使用 Duolingo 时，她努力工作，但她优雅地接受了女儿的所有批评。拥有一位“完美妈妈”——一位渴望成为男爵的妈妈——是萨莎对芭比的愤怒的根源。<br><br>女孩通过认同生活中的成年人来培养自尊，对她们中的许多人来说，最重要的是认同她们的母亲。他们需要将母亲理想化为榜样，但他们也需要与她建立联系，在她身上认识到自己。当母亲过于完美时，她的女儿就会感到孤独，或者更糟糕的是，感到有缺陷。对于一个有这种感觉的女孩来说，像萨莎那样，倾向于“奇怪、黑暗和疯狂”的身份并不罕见，这就是我的很多病人来到我办公室的原因。<br><br>首先，我会见到一位美丽、成功的十几岁女孩的妈妈，她进来为我讲述她女儿的历史。妈妈似乎把这一切都放在一起，对女儿为什么挣扎，特别是为什么她看起来对她如此生气感到困惑。人们常常担心女儿如何向世界展示自己。 “为什么她需要穿着那件暴露的露脐上衣露出那么多肚子？”或者，相反：“她为什么不关心看起来漂亮呢？”<br><br>那我就去见见女儿吧。我见过十几岁的女孩把饼干藏在房间里，这样她们瘦小的妈妈就不会评判她们。我认识一些年轻女性，她们很感激 TikTok 曝光了“杏仁妈妈”，她会告诉你是否饿了，只需吃几颗杏仁即可。我听说过：“即使她什么也没说，我也知道她在评判我。”我见过一些妈妈对女儿的饮食习惯、身体和外貌公然批评。我也见过那些从不说什么的人，但他们的女儿仍然感到受到评判。无论女儿们正在投射或接受一些真实的东西——有声的还是无声的，来自母亲还是来自我们的文化——我发现，女孩们很难摆脱青春期而不感到母亲在以某种方式评判她们。<br><br>我的母亲总是给她讲同样的故事，她珍视一切形式的美，无论是古董梳妆台还是花园里的西红柿：“她会告诉我，‘摘下你的眼镜！涂上你的口红！’”我妈妈讨厌它。她通过“忘记”化妆来反抗，但她（毫不费力、令人恼火的）美丽证明她仍然明白这一点。在我成长的过程中，她可能从来没有告诉我要涂睫毛膏，但她却总是提醒我不要吃面包。无论我是否反抗——无论我点了披萨还是给自己做了一顿“女孩晚餐”——我也明白了这一点。对于我们许多内心怀有青春期的人来说也是如此：妈妈一句简单的“你看起来棒极了”就意味着一种侮辱，因为你可能还有一次不那么棒。<br><br>最近，一位年轻女士在我的办公室里哭泣，她描述了我的病人越成功，她的母亲就越不支持我，反而更加怨恨。由于被逐出母亲鼓励的孵化器，她很难为自己的成功感到高兴。母女之间的嫉妒甚至会渗透到最亲密的关系中，而且是双向的。一些精神分析学家认为，女儿们对“完美”妈妈的嫉妒感从婴儿期就开始了，那时婴儿认为母亲拥有婴儿所需的一切，拥有所有的答案——当婴儿无法解决问题时，母亲成为“拥有者”之一。它本身的问题，是一个“没有”。<br><br>就母亲而言，她们在照顾女儿时可能会觉得有义务牺牲自己的身份和欲望，并且常常觉得自己随着女儿的成长而恶化。正如<i>芭比娃娃</i>中爱女儿、热爱当妈妈的格洛丽亚所说：“我从来没有任何乐趣！”母亲的嫉妒是很常见的，但当它不受控制时，母亲的关注就不再像温暖的光芒，而更像是刺眼的聚光灯。<br><br>我经常目睹的悲剧是，母亲和女儿想要彼此相爱、和睦相处，希望得到深切关注的认可，但没有评判。在我的办公室里，一位母亲经常会说她只是想帮忙；她只是想帮忙。她的批评源于大量的关心。女儿会回答说她不需要这种帮助；她想要不那么伤人的爱。他们的心在正确的地方，但正确的地方似乎永远无法居住。<br><br>这些女孩想要的是电影中芭比和她妈妈的形象。我们最终见到了她的创造者露丝·汉德勒（Ruth Handler）——坐在古朴的厨房里，在桃红色的薄雾中，这是一种家庭舒适的景象。我们可以在露丝的目光中看到芭比娃娃发生了什么——治愈、容光焕发：<br><br> “我通常看起来不像这样。我通常看起来很完美，”芭比说。<br><br> “我认为你是对的，”露丝甜蜜而明智地说，她的眼睛里闪烁着爱意。<br><br>最终，芭比需要她母亲的认可，就像我办公室里的十几岁女孩一样。正是露丝对芭比的温柔关怀帮助她找到了与过去分离并成为自己的勇气——拒绝继续成为客体而转而成为主体。<br><br>但芭比并不是真正的女儿，露丝实际上也不是她的母亲。露丝是一位幻想中的母亲，她坐在厨房里，时间凝固了，手里拿着一杯永远热腾腾的茶，而自己却不需要任何东西。她从来不需要催促芭比洗澡或吃健康的零食，她当然也不需要在回复工作电子邮件和尝试做晚饭时做到这一点。事实上，露丝说出了电影中最令人不安的信息之一：“母亲们站着不动，这样我们的女儿就可以回头看看她们走了多远。” （说真的，露丝？） 同样，芭比娃娃也没有和露丝一起长大，也没有度过她的一生，受到她的照顾和审视。这部电影中的露丝除了接受和崇拜芭比之外没有什么别的事情，芭比没有理由去寻找露丝慈爱眼神中隐藏的判断——她更像是仙女教母，而不是真正的母亲。从某种意义上说，露丝是母亲们的芭比娃娃：同样不真实。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-girlhood-greta-gerwig/674821/">梅根·奥罗克：美国少女文化真的很奇怪</a><br><br>值得庆幸的是，这部电影为母女俩提供了另一种更容易了解彼此的方式。当不努力“拥有一切”时，格洛丽亚（电影中唯一真正的母亲）会画一些好奇的芭比娃娃——“无法抑制的死亡想法芭比”、“橘皮组织芭比”和“严重羞耻芭比”。起初，格洛丽亚似乎对这些艺术努力感到尴尬，但它们最终打破了与女儿的紧张关系：“它们​​很奇怪、黑暗、疯狂——一切都是你假装不存在的，”萨莎说。这些图画在剧情中发挥了神奇的作用，扰乱了芭比完美的芭比乐园生活，并让她踏上了自己的追求。正是在这个安静而诚实的时刻，萨莎终于将她的母亲视为一个可以与她产生共鸣的人。<br><br>母女关系不可避免地受到家族史、文化史以及母亲和女儿投射的不安全感的影响。我们不可能都是露丝。一个内心感到黑暗和奇怪的真正的少女想要一个黑暗和奇怪的榜样，而不是露丝。最重要的是，对联系的无尽渴望。尽管不可能始终保持正确的平衡，但幸运的是，芭比在电影结束时意识到她必须拒绝不可能的事物，转而支持真实的事物。<br><br></div>

维持生计。即使是运动员也不鼓励在田野和赛道上喝水，以免过量的液体减慢他们的速度。 “我无法告诉你有多少人说我很愚蠢，”斯托基告诉我，因为他是为数不多的水倡导者之一。<br><br>但在世纪之交，补水成为了美国人的一种迷恋。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/celebrities-and-bottled-w_b_705534">名人</a>在杂志上宣传水的好处；超市货架上的品牌瓶子占满了。关于水合作用的学术研究经历了一次小繁荣。经过多年的持续口渴之后，我们突然开始喝酒、喝酒、喝酒，因为我们觉得我们应该这样做。这是一个水生大转弯——而且完全没有科学意义。<br><br>从抽象的角度来看，水合作用的重要性是无可争议的。 Water keeps our organs chugging and our muscles agile; it helps distribute nutrients through the body and maintains our inner thermostat. Take it away, and cells inevitably die. But the concrete specifics of adequate water intake are still, in large part, a mess. For hydration, “there are no clear numbers, or a threshold you have to maintain,” says Yasuki Sekiguchi, a sports-performance scientist at Texas Tech University. Experts <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26885571/">don&#39;t agree</a> on <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/12/1928">how much water people need</a> , or the best ways to tell when someone should drink; they differ on how to measure hydration, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/well/live/how-much-water-should-I-drink.html">which beverages are adequately hydrating</a> , and how much importance to attribute to thirst. They have yet to reach quorum on what hydration—a process that&#39;s sustained life since its primordial inception— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/12/1928">fundamentally <em>is</em></a> <em>.</em> The murkiness has left the field of hydration research, still relatively young and relatively small, rife with “vicious camps against each other,” says Tamara Hew-Butler, an exercise physiologist at Wayne State University.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/the-dos-and-donts-of-hydrating-in-a-heat-wave/674704/">Read: Drink more water</a><br><br><br> Forget, for instance, one of water&#39;s most persistent myths: the oft-repeated advice to down eight 8-ounce glasses of water each day. No one can say for certain, but one theory is that the idea  sprouted from a misinterpretation of a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/ajpregu.00365.2002">nutrition document from the 1940s</a> , which stated that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1753-6405.2012.00866.x">2.5 liters</a> of water a day (that is, approximately <em>10</em> 8-ounce glasses) was “a suitable allowance for adults” in “most instances.” The guidance also noted, in the very same paragraph, “Most of this quantity is contained in prepared foods.” But the bigger issue is this: Probably <em>no</em> single number for water intake will ever suffice—not for a population of people with varying weights, genetics, diets, and activity levels, living in varying climates. Even within an individual, what&#39;s best will change through a lifetime. The answer to <em>How much water should I be drinking?</em> is invariably <em>Uh, it really depends.</em><br><br> Today&#39;s hydration zeitgeist seems to hold that no amount of water is too much. The market teems with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://waterminder.com/#:~:text=Track%20your%20hydration%20progress%20and,your%20progress%20at%20a%20glance.">intake-tracking smartphone apps</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Gallon-Water-Bottle-Time-Marker/dp/B08FX8GSJP/ref=asc_df_B08FX8GSJP/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=642093966697&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=12400949120116405475&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001913&amp;hvtargid=pla-1463145819529&amp;psc=1&amp;gclid=CjwKCAjwt52mBhB5EiwA05YKoyvwqbDz1ymSSYjRLCOU-cJXFthzcag4GE2t9sTjDKWb3XWrF4fNixoCcKgQAvD_BwE">time-stamped</a> bottles that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B18R9JXY/ref=syn_sd_onsite_desktop_0?ie=UTF8&amp;pf_rd_p=440d6fd0-c026-415a-b337-b91e955ddf42&amp;pf_rd_r=Z21GBTP3ZHMTW0E6GRED&amp;pd_rd_wg=fN5eQ&amp;pd_rd_w=GCDJH&amp;pd_rd_r=f47b4a65-b50a-4641-b269-3bc388eaf785&amp;th=1">cheer</a> drinkers toward hydration goals as high as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/BuildLife-Motivational-Fitness-Capacity-Throughout/dp/B07NWCHJTP/ref=asc_df_B07NWCHJTP/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=343257910216&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16597572817028404074&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001913&amp;hvtargid=pla-729029777688&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=&amp;ref=&amp;adgrpid=66485480382&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvadid=343257910216&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=16597572817028404074&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9001913&amp;hvtargid=pla-729029777688">a gallon</a> a day—a quota astronomical enough to be stressful, even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/11/7/1539">dangerous</a> , should people flood their bodies all at once. But America&#39;s hydration hype machine “has established a narrative that we are all walking around dehydrated, and need to drink more,” Hew-Butler told me. It&#39;s no wonder that some people have reported legitimate <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://happiful.com/what-is-dehydration-anxiety">anxiety</a> over falling short on water intake.<br><br> No single source sold America on water. But a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/podcasts/decoder-ring/2021/04/decoder-ring-the-history-of-hydration">2021 episode</a> of the podcast <em>Decoder Ring</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sporkful.com/how-did-staying-hydrated-become-a-thing/">points to Gatorade</a> as one of the first companies to pitch dehydration as a health problem—while simultaneously offering a cure. The company&#39;s sports drinks were originally billed as thirst-quenchers, designed to stave off performance dips. But by the 1980s, <em>Decoder Ring</em> reported, the Gatorade Sports Science Institute was churning out data that supported the benefits of drinking before the mouth got parched. A decade later, the American College of Sports Medicine was recommending that athletes consume “the maximal amount” of water they could stand to keep down.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/09/organic-gatorade-srsly/499154/">Read: The organic Gatorade illusion</a><br><br> Around the same time, during the fitness craze of the &#39;70s and &#39;80s, water was acquiring another identity: the enlightened socialite&#39;s clean drink of choice. When European companies such as Perrier and Evian <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.seriouseats.com/how-bottled-water-became-americas-most-popular-beverage">brought their bottled water to North America</a> , they <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/04/style/self-care/hydrate-hydrate-hydrate.html">found a market</a> among those wanting a high-end, calorie- and sweetener-free alternative to sodas, alcohol, and juice. Water “had this healthy, good-for-you halo,” says Michael Bellas, the chair and CEO of the Beverage Marketing Corporation. “There were no negatives.” In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bottledwater.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/BMC2016_BWR_StatsArticle.pdf">2016</a> , water became the US&#39;s leading bottled beverage, a title it has maintained since.<br><br> As water&#39;s market share grew, so did its mythos. Companies hocked the illusion that their products could make people not just healthier but “sexier and more popular,” Peter Gleick, the author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-three-ages-of-water-prehistoric-past-imperiled-present-and-a-hope-for-the-future-peter-gleick/9781541702271?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Three Ages of Water</em></a> , told me. Hydration was so clearly vital to life that truth-adjacent ideas about its benefits, many of them pushed by prominent people, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/theoval/2013/09/12/obama-michelle-drink-water-project-politico/2803417/">were easy to buy</a> . Even concerns over single-use plastic bottles could not slow water&#39;s roll: In response, the world cooked up eco-friendly Yetis, HydroFlasks, and Nalgenes, and made those trendy, too.<br><br> It&#39;s not that water <em>isn&#39;t</em> healthy <em>.</em> There&#39;s just no evidence to show that guzzling tons of water can fix all our ailments. For people prone to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32632658/">kidney stones and UTIs</a> , drinking more has been shown to cut down on risks; as a swap for sugary beverages, it can also help with weight loss. But for a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/upshot/no-you-do-not-have-to-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html">variety of other issues</a> —such as heart disease, metabolic issues, and cancer—the data is often “really mixed,” Hew-Butler told me. Although researchers have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1159%2F000479640">sometimes found evidence</a> that dehydration may <em>raise</em> certain conditions&#39; risks, that doesn&#39;t automatically imply the inverse—that extra water intake then <em>lowers</em> risk from a typical baseline. At very rare extremes, overdoing it on water can kill us, too.<br><br> The connections between hydration and health are shaky enough that health authorities have been reluctant to push a strict <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ods.od.nih.gov/HealthInformation/nutrientrecommendations.aspx">recommended daily allowance</a> , like the ones that exist for various vitamins. Instead, the National Academy of Medicine proposes a tentative “adequate intake”: 3.7 liters of total water intake for men, and 2.7 for women (both including hydration from food). Recently, Abigail Colburn, a physiology researcher at Yale, and her colleagues <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35943601/">ran an analysis</a> that concluded those figures were sound. Still, the numbers came from population surveys, published in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/news/2004/02/report-sets-dietary-intake-levels-for-water-salt-and-potassium-to-maintain-health-and-reduce-chronic-disease-risk">early aughts</a> , of the amounts that Americans were <em>already</em> drinking—a reflection of how things <em>were</em> , but not necessarily how they <em>should be.</em> And they represent medians within a huge range. Over the years, multiple studies have documented people living, by all appearances healthfully, on daily water budgets that span less than a liter to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/12/1928">four, five, or six—sometimes more</a> .<br><br> If researchers don&#39;t agree on how much water is good, they also differ on how little water is bad: the point at which dehydration starts to become a problem—or how long people can linger at that threshold without raising long-term health risks.<br><br> A bit of water loss should be completely fine. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25346594/">Fluid status</a> is, by design, “a constantly changing state,” Colburn told me. When the body doesn&#39;t take in enough water to recoup the liquid it&#39;s lost—as it naturally does throughout the day, via sweat, urine, and breath—the brain releases a hormone called vasopressin that prompts the kidneys to hold onto fluid. The urine gets darker and less voluminous; eventually, blood-salt levels rise, and the mouth and throat ache with thirst. The goal is to get the body to excrete less water out and take more in so we don&#39;t wring our vital tissues dry. Life forms have evolved to tread carefully down this cascade of steps, and the flexibility is built in—much like a rubber band that snaps back after being stretched and released.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/09/why-drink-more-water/279591/">Read: Why &#39;drink more water&#39;?</a><br><br> But some researchers have started to worry about repeatedly asking the body to compensate for less than optimal hydration—stretching the band over and over again. The issue isn&#39;t chronic <em>de</em> hydration, Colburn told me, but a subtler precursor state called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-018-01889-z"><em>under</em> hydration</a> , which occurs after a lack of water intake has prompted the body to conserve but before the appearance of signals such as thirst. It&#39;s not clear how worrying teetering on that precipice is. In the same way a rubber band is “designed to stretch,” our fluid balance is built to bounce back, says Evan Johnson, a hydration expert at the University of Wyoming. Over time, though, wear and tear could add up, and resilience could drop.<br><br> Tracking those outcomes gets even more complicated when researchers try to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28614817/">quantify</a> how dehydrated individual people are—another thing that experts can&#39;t agree on. “We really don&#39;t have a gold standard for measuring the all-encompassing term of hydration,” Johnson told me, especially one that&#39;s both simple and cheap, and can account for body water&#39;s constant flux. Which leaves scientists with imperfect proxies. Broadly speaking, there&#39;s a urine camp and a blood camp, Stookey told me. Those in the pee camp tend to be hydration conservatives. A change in urine color or volume, they argue, is an early sign—well in advance of thirst—of impending dehydration. The blood-camp crew is more laissez-faire. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25346594/">Diet, medications, and supplements</a> can all alter the shade of urine, making it a fickle clue; Hew-Butler for instance, defines true dehydration as what happens when the plasma&#39;s gotten saltier than usual, to the point where cells have started to shrink—a sign that retaining water is no longer sufficient, and that the body needs to drink <em>.</em><br><br> Which camp researchers fall into <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/upshot/no-you-do-not-have-to-drink-8-glasses-of-water-a-day.html">influences</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28614817/">how bad they think America&#39;s hydration problem is</a> . “When you draw blood, most people are within a normal range if they&#39;re not thirsty,” Hew-Butler told me. But Stookey, who&#39;s firmly in the pee camp, contends that a majority of Americans are “walking around dehydrated” and should be drinking far more. Colburn, too, would rather err on the side of heeding urine&#39;s warning signs. By the time thirst kicks in, “you&#39;re already in a dangerous zone,” she told me.<br><br> There can be a middle ground. Sekiguchi, of Texas Tech, told me that for most young, healthy people who are spending plenty of time in the air-conditioned indoors—as so many Americans do—it&#39;s probably fine to just drink when thirsty. (That advice works less well for older people, because the sensation of thirst tends to dull with age.) When specific circumstances shift—a stint of heavy exercise, a week of toasty days—people can take notice, and adjust accordingly.<br><br> But guidelines for typical water intake, under typical conditions, are quickly going out the window as heat waves get more frequent and intense. When temperatures skyrocket and humidity makes otherwise-cooling sweat stick stubbornly on skin, our bodies need more water to keep cool and functional, beyond what thirst alone might dictate. Part of the problem is that thirst vanishes more quickly than the body rehydrates, Sekiguchi told me, which means that people who drink until they <em>think</em> they&#39;re sated tend to replace only a fraction of the fluids that they&#39;ve lost.<br><br><br> “We&#39;re never going to be able to tell people an exact number,” Colburn told me, for how much to drink. But in reality, many of the healthy people most worried about fine-tuning their hydration to a perfect level are probably among those that <em>least</em> need to fret. The dangers of water tend to happen not in those middle grounds, but at its extremes—especially when <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.asce.org/publications-and-news/civil-engineering-source/civil-engineering-magazine/article/2022/11/jackson-water-crisis-reveals-perils-of-neglected-infrastructure">failing infrastructure</a> hampers access to water, or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nrdc.org/stories/flint-water-crisis-everything-you-need-know">contamination</a> makes it undrinkable. Many of the populations that are most vulnerable to dehydration&#39;s effects also happen to be the same groups that probably aren&#39;t getting enough to drink, Johnson told me.

Where did politics end and psychology—or psychopathology—begin? Thus the Trump years have inevitably given rise to the routine flouting of the Goldwater Rule, most notably in a collection of writings assembled by the former Yale psychiatrist Bandy Lee, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-dangerous-case-of-donald-trump-37-psychiatrists-and-mental-health-experts-assess-a-president---updated-and-expanded-with-new-essays-bandy-x-lee/9781250212863?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 37 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President</i></a> . (Lee subsequently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/the-yale-professor-fired-for-tweeting-about-alan-dershowitz.html">got fired from Yale</a> for publicly arguing that Alan Dershowitz was suffering from a “shared psychosis” with Trump.)<br><br> Now, with Trump the Republican 2024 front-runner—his accumulating indictments notwithstanding—the psychiatrist Peter D. Kramer seems to have successfully engineered an end run around the Goldwater Rule: In his interesting and challenging new novel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/death-of-the-great-man-peter-d-kramer/9781637587966?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Death of the Great Man</i></a> , Kramer takes on some of the relevant psychological issues of the Trump era via fiction.<br><br> Kramer, the longtime Brown University medical-school professor who became internationally famous 30 years ago for writing the best-selling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/listening-to-prozac-a-psychiatrist-explores-antidepressant-drugs-and-the-remaking-of-the-self-revised-edition-peter-d-kramer/9780140266719?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Listening to Prozac</i></a> , helped transform how we think about psychopharmacology and the self. In this novel, he confronts his protagonist, an idealistic psychiatrist named Henry Farber who shares much of Kramer&#39;s biography, with the question of how and whether to provide psychotherapy to an American president who shares much of Trump&#39;s biography.<br><br> Kramer is at pains to emphasize that he doesn&#39;t intend a one-to-one correlation between his fictional president, who is referred to only as the “Great Man,” and the real-life Trump. Yet in his general behavior (he&#39;s an erratic and autocratic populist who has shredded democratic norms) and many details (he has an attractive, younger European wife, and has refused to accept defeat in his reelection campaign, which took place amid the depredations of a global pandemic), the Great Man is unmistakably Trumpian.<br><br> The Great Man is also—we learn in the novel&#39;s third sentence—dead, almost certainly murdered; his body was discovered on the couch in Farber&#39;s consulting room in Providence, Rhode Island. The novel flashes back (how did the president come to be in Farber&#39;s office?) and forward (who killed the Great Man? Will Farber get fingered for it?), but it is not a classic whodunit, because Kramer heavily seasons the mystery with stylistic elements drawn from literary fiction and political satire, which allows for both comedy and commentary. For instance, Kramer depicts the Great Man&#39;s wife, Náomi, who on the surface seems much like Melania Trump, as a literary intellectual and former dramaturge with liberal leanings and an interest in existential philosophy. So nauseated is Náomi by the moral (and literal) stench of her husband that she routinely retches when he&#39;s nearby. She also turns out to have been the secret instigator of the effort to recruit a therapist for the Great Man. She may also be his murderer.<br><br> I interviewed Kramer on Zoom earlier this summer. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.<br><br> <b>Scott Stossel:</b> What inspired this novel?<br><br> <b>Peter D. Kramer:</b> This was an epiphany. It was December of 2016, and Trump had just been elected. I was in New York, consulting on clinical cases at Cornell medical school. One of my editors had a short amount of time for me at the end of the day, and so I went to Union Square, near my publisher&#39;s offices, a little early. It was rainy, so I went into the Barnes &amp; Noble to look for books for my grandsons. I was on the escalator and the book just came to me: I thought I should write a novel that relates to Trump. The framework came to me almost whole. I went into a little corner in the children&#39;s books section and started writing notes on my phone.<br><br> And then I went in and presented my idea to the editor, and he said: “Absolutely not.” And I thought, well, this is what I have to write, and I sat down to write it anyway.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/07/a-crack-in-psychoanalytic-standards-courtesy-of-the-president/534825/">Read: Evaluating Trump&#39;s psyche in public</a><br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> What was the editor&#39;s objection?  Fear of political blowback or just “this isn&#39;t gonna sell”?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I knew from the start that this book was going to begin with a toxic populist US president dead on a psychiatrist&#39;s couch—and of course if Trump had died at some point in between the writing of the book and its publication, that wouldn&#39;t have been amusing.<br><br> This editor had another reasonable objection, which is that assassination for regime change is an illiberal expedient. It&#39;s not amusing. You can&#39;t kill off presidents—it&#39;s just morally not the right thing. But in the novel, this <i>isn&#39;t</i> murder for regime change; every character around him has a reason to want the Great Man dead. And these reasons are really only incidentally political. He&#39;s just so horrible to everyone, and so many people have their own motives for killing him.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> How close did you mean to make the Great Man to Trump? Did you start with the public Trump we all see on TV and try to imagine his inner life?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> The thinking began with Trump, but of course characters take on their own lives for the writer. I am not an expert on politics or history, so I focused on what Trump would look like to a psychotherapist. That meant I had to create what I didn&#39;t know about, which is this intimate person: How does he treat his wife? How does he treat people around him? How would he do in therapy? And I was running into this other constraint, which is that psychiatrists are not supposed to diagnose public figures from a distance. I didn&#39;t want to violate the Goldwater Rule by saying, “Oh, this is fiction” and then depicting Trump exactly. I wanted, instead, to play with the question of what psychiatrists would do if they could really get close to a Trump figure.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> The reader&#39;s mind inevitably goes to Trump because the Great Man behaves in very Trumplike ways and has a very Trumplike biography.<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> My model was the dictator fiction that&#39;s common in Latin America. In <i>The Autumn of the Patriarch</i> , Gabriel García Márquez takes a particular dictator, Gustavo Pinilla of Colombia, and adds elements of General Franco of Spain and Juan Vicente Gómez of Venezuela, and creates this outrageous version of a dictator. Márquez has him basically governing the country from the grave. So that gave me, I thought, license to create a comic character who was outrageous in certain ways. Whether he&#39;s more outrageous than Trump, I can&#39;t say. But he&#39;s outrageous in his own way, and specifically Trumplike in five or six other ways.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Let&#39;s talk about the Goldwater Rule. Don&#39;t mental-health professionals have a “duty to warn” when somebody poses a danger to themselves or others? And what if that danger posed is not to an individual but to the entire American population, which is clearly how some of the experts in the Lee book see Trump?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> The real function of the Goldwater Rule is to protect psychiatry from itself—from all these doctors expressing their <i>political</i> views through making diagnoses without a careful respect for the clinical facts. I remember an era when—this is way back—people would say, “Well, if your patient has not expressed anxiety about the atom bomb, the patient is in denial.” And I thought, <i>My patients will express whatever they express, and the introduction of uniform political views into psychiatry is a disaster</i> . I&#39;ve had patients who were very much on the front lines of the anti-abortion movement, and I am very much on the other side. But you are out to treat the patient who&#39;s in front of you—you&#39;re not out to impose your views or ask them to see things differently than they do.<br><br> You just need to deal with patients as you find them—even with patients who are racist and prejudiced and anti-Semitic or whatever. To create some kind of internal rule in psychotherapy that integrates political views is a disaster.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Let&#39;s say you have a patient referred to you with depression, and he quickly evinces extreme racist and misogynistic views, and election denialism. What would that encounter in the consulting room look like?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> This is very much one of the topics of the book. One of the worries regarding Henry Farber is that he will go and treat the Great Man, and that will just give the Great Man some ease, and make him better able to do the terrible things he does. Farber has great faith in his therapeutic method, so the setup is this: He&#39;s known—as I am—for writing a book early in his career that was a best seller, and he&#39;s also known as a sleep doctor. Later in life he&#39;s specialized in the treatment of paranoid men. And he&#39;s brought in to treat the Great Man&#39;s insomnia, but secretly there&#39;s some hope on the part of the people who bring him in that he will treat the personality problems as well. And I think Farber is comfortable with what seems like a corrupt assignment, because he just believes in his therapeutic method, which is that if he sits empathetically beside his patient—metaphorically speaking—and looks out at the world as his patient does, and gets the patient to feel what he feels and be aware of his feelings, good things will happen, that there will be some general liberation, and that will be useful both for his sleep problems and his disordered personality. But he&#39;s not trying to nudge the person in any direction; he&#39;s trying to get the person to free himself of whatever it is that constrains his feeling and thinking.<br><br> Farber&#39;s extreme commitment to this approach is comic. When the Great Man throws him into a jail cell at one point, Farber thinks, <i>How can I utilize this thing that my patient has done? The patient will indirectly notice how I behave in the jail cell, and maybe I can do that in a way that&#39;s therapeutic; I&#39;ll prepare for our next encounter by reviewing similar cases</i> . I don&#39;t know that I am self-abnegating in that way. But I do retain an idealistic faith in the therapeutic method that if you put people in touch with themselves—that&#39;s your job, and your job isn&#39;t to guide the direction of progress.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Let&#39;s say, as implausible as this is, Ivanka calls you up and says, “My father is suffering from grave depression after his brush with COVID mortality”—would you do as Farber does and take Trump on as a patient?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I would take the case in a minute. I think Farber cross-examines this stuff: Is he taking the case because this will demonstrate that he&#39;s a virtuoso of empathy, or out of his own self-aggrandizement because this is such a challenging case? I do think I would be tempted by the level of effort that would be required. I like taking on cases that I thought were difficult for me because they were unlikeable patients. (Anyone who&#39;s my patient: That wasn&#39;t you!) I do think the book is my attempt to imagine what the level of effort would be like. Farber keeps looking for the element of full humanity in his patient. When he perceives this little spark of it, he&#39;s so encouraged by it; he thinks there&#39;s something here he can work with. I think that would be a challenge with someone like Trump: sort of waiting him out until you see that little hint of something that&#39;s not propaganda and self-praise but something that has a little texture and dimensionality to it. I mean, I was really trying to imagine what that would look like for Trump.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> And what would that look like?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I think it could be exposure of vulnerability. Could just be genuine emotion. There are easy emotions like anger, which is sort of the lowest-level emotion; patients who can&#39;t access much else can often access rage. But there are other moments where I imagine under all the grievance there could be some genuine pain or sadness, and you&#39;re curious about that.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Imagine Trump meeting with a child psychiatrist when he was a younger person. Do you think this would help him process whatever the trauma of growing up with his father was?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I think it&#39;s at least possible to think that this grudge against the world, the constant sense of having been wronged, could have been diminished. That&#39;s what psychiatry that examines early-childhood injuries is out to do—free people from being in the thrall of their resentment for the rest of their lives.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Allen Frances, the psychiatrist who presided over the composition of the <i>DSM-4</i> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780062394521/twilight-of-american-sanity/">has written</a> that Trump&#39;s presidency and aberrant behavior are more symptoms of culture that&#39;s gone mad than of any psychiatric illness. And Jeffrey Lieberman, a psychiatrist at Columbia, has written that Trump doesn&#39;t have any <i>DSM</i> illness—he&#39;s just “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/opinion/trump-mentally-ill.html">a jerk</a> .” Do you think there are links between various personality types and certain political ideologies or behaviors?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I know Jeff and Allen a little bit, and I don&#39;t agree with the argument “Well, this is just evil, and diagnosis has nothing to do with it.” Diagnosis aside, I think what we saw was four years of a certain kind of personality on display. And it was almost impossible to be a political analyst without wondering about certain of his actions; there wasn&#39;t enough logic in the behavior to explain it only in political terms. In the book, I write about “arbitocracy.” This isn&#39;t really authoritarianism, because it&#39;s not consistent enough, or organized well enough—not that authoritarian regimes generally are either—but this seemed to be even more arbitrary and herky-jerky. So, yes, I think personality is relevant in talking about the politics of Trump.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> I know you don&#39;t want to diagnose Trump. But having sat, as Henry Farber, in therapy sessions with the imaginary Great Man, what would you diagnose Great Man with? If he&#39;s gonna file an insurance claim, that requires your giving him a <i>DSM</i> diagnosis, right?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/donald-trump-not-well/597640/">Read: Trump is not well</a><br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> Right. I&#39;m with Farber, who says that the men in his paranoid-men&#39;s group do not meet a strict by-the-book definition of paranoia; they&#39;re people who have this same kind of hypervigilant posture in the world. And he says of the Great Man, “Yes, he would qualify as one of my patients.” So it&#39;s sort of a loose paranoia for the Great Man.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Is paranoia a <i>DSM</i> disorder?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> It&#39;s a delusional disorder, which is in the <i>DSM</i> . And of course I diagnosed patients in my practice for the purpose of deciding which medicine to use, and for insurance claims. I think diagnosis is very helpful. But personality disorders—that is, borderline personality, sociopathy, or paranoia, the kinds of diagnoses that were debated with regard to Trump—were never something where I&#39;ve found the particulars that useful. Patients don&#39;t necessarily stick with one personality-disorder diagnosis—they can have one and a year later have another, or the diagnosis can even disappear, and they end up with just depression or drug abuse or something, and don&#39;t have the personality disorder. It&#39;s not a very stable diagnosis.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Are personality disorders susceptible to treatment by medication? If you were treating Trump—or, if you prefer, if Farber is treating the Great Man—is there a drug regimen that could ease their distress or make them less inclined to wreak pain and havoc on everyone around them?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> Well, the experience of treating personality disorder with medication has not been terrific. There certainly was a lot of use of SSRIs in treating borderline personality disorder, with some success and a lot of failure. I think the results were similar for lithium. In <i>Listening to Prozac</i> , I talk a lot about rejection sensitivity, a category that isn&#39;t written about a lot anymore. And people had this diagnosis of rejection sensitive dysphoria, which sometimes did well on antidepressants. It turned out that really what was going on was that their vulnerability to social insult was so great that they looked very erratic, and on medication they could be less erratic and less in pain.<br><br> But as a therapist looking at the relationship between Henry Farber and the Great Man, I wasn&#39;t tempted for Farber to reach for the prescription pad. I did not want to introduce medication to the book.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> You can&#39;t medicate a politician into making better policy.<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> Yeah. I mean, I think if you got up close to one of these political figures and saw that he had ADHD, maybe a stimulant would be calming in a paradoxical way. Or if the person really is manic, maybe lithium would be helpful. You can imagine some diagnosis that can&#39;t be made from a distance but here up close you might see something that was not as evident in these speeches and debates. Medication could possibly help with those.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 11:46:13 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/trump-goldwater-rule-death-of-the-great-man-book-review/674919/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/trump-goldwater-rule-death-of-the-great-man-book-review/674919/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Surprising Profundity of The Righteous Gemstones]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Danny McBride&#39;s show about a flawed evangelical family is goofy on its face but unusually eloquent on the subject of forgiveness. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OOjvAvMaAXpRP-mn2WoEz0TSdE8=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/righteous_gemstones/original.jpg" alt="《正义宝石》中的杰西·宝石 (Jesse Gemstone) 站在水中" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Ryan Green / HBO</figcaption></figure> <em><strong>This article contains spoilers through the Season 3 finale of</strong></em> <strong>The Righteous Gemstones</strong> <em><strong>.</strong></em><br><br> Though it uses the register of low comedy rather than moody character study or tragicomic caper, HBO&#39;s <em>The Righteous Gemstones</em> , which follows a family of materialistic and vaguely corrupt religious showpeople, is prestige TV in the classic mold. Like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/05/succession-season-4-finale-review/674219/"><em>Succession</em></a> or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/better-call-saul-season-6-slow-tv/629370/"><em>Better Call Saul</em></a> , it centers on a richly flawed antihero as he builds his empire, and, in the process, studies the workings of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/12/succession-satire-market-speak-love-language/620976/">American power and money</a> . The popularity of these shows has led some critics to suspect that closely attending to such protagonists—especially when they are lent the glamour of handsome, high-budget production values—doubles as a form of subtle approval. In applying this storytelling model to a specifically Christian milieu, though, <em>Gemstones</em> upends it. Its characters are also flawed, and also vividly rendered. But for their bad behavior, they expect—and are granted—absolution, a worldview that foregrounds how strange and arbitrary the act of forgiveness is in the first place.<br><br> The show follows Jesse Gemstone, played by its showrunner, Danny McBride, with his trademark defensive combustibility, as he prepares to inherit a religious-entertainment empire from his father, Eli (John Goodman). Through flashbacks, the series shows us the rise of the Gemstones from hardscrabble small-time religious revivalists to Reagan-era TV stars to scandal-plagued Christian-theme-park operators. In depicting this ascent, the show also allows us to see that this family—Jesse; his youth-pastor brother, Kelvin (Adam Devine); his horny, aggressive sister, Judy (a particularly brilliant Edi Patterson); Eli, the stern patriarch; and his late wife, Aimee-Leigh (Jennifer Nettles), the closest thing the family had to a conscience—is knee-deep in much that is toxic about American culture. Whether it&#39;s celebrity worship, consumerist waste, or phony relationship advice, the Gemstones have a hand in it. But the show never really allows the viewer to hate them. They are too funny, too desperate, too pathetic, too humanly appetitive to lose the audience&#39;s grudging affection.<br><br> Part of the reason that this type of prestige show works is the creators&#39; genuine fascination with the environment their characters live in. McBride is the only storyteller I can think of who understands the particular world of religious showpeople well enough to fully exploit its dramatic potential—which is, like Jerry Falwell, way too rich. Because of the cultural and financial power held by televangelists, there&#39;s immense artistic possibility to be found in digging into any discrepancies between their behavior and their beliefs, and the details of the ways they work—the grist of many great TV shows.<br><br> When televangelists succeed, they can find themselves on top of their world, just like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/01/tony-soprano-dead-or-not/579736/">Tony Soprano</a> or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/03/-em-mad-men-em-s-creator-don-draper-represents-american-society/284519/">Don Draper</a> . But when they fail, as the Gemstones often do, they are both funnier and sadder than Saul Goodman: Nothing is more incongruous than a person performing the role of a wealthy and powerful person to their own disinterested family. Just as a person needn&#39;t like organized crime in order to enjoy David Chase&#39;s dissection of the mobster&#39;s psychology, a secular viewer can observe the Gemstones&#39; worldly machinations with fascination (as does the investigative reporter Thaniel Block, played by Jason Schwartzman in the show&#39;s second season). We&#39;ve had a few classic novels ( <em>Elmer Gantry</em> , <em>Wise Blood</em> ) and movies ( <em>The Apostle</em> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/09/the-eyes-of-tammy-faye-redemption/620199/"><em>The Eyes of Tammy Faye</em></a> ) about the world of revivalist, Pentecostal Christianity, but <em>Gemstones</em> is the first show to fully dive in. The details of the first-season plot were so perfectly observed that the series seemed prophetic: Around the time its pilot aired, depicting Jesse being blackmailed with a video of himself and his church buddies snorting cocaine alongside sex workers, the second-generation evangelical figure Jerry Falwell Jr. found himself embroiled in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/us/falwell-resigns-liberty-university.html">sex scandal</a> . A more recent Southern Baptist <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/southern-baptist-convention-bans-female-pastors-ejecting-several-churches-in-the-process">controversy</a> over the roles of women echoes the struggles of Judy to find her place in a patriarchal order.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/10/netflixs-midnight-mass/620446/">Read: The Netflix series that should make religious people uncomfortable</a><br><br> In the most recent season, Eli and his family are pitted against a set of relatives who have attempted to keep their Christianity weird and countercultural, in pointed contrast to the materialistic Gemstones. Unfortunately, in their case this means being violent right-wing survivalists. If the Gemstones practice a syncretism of Christ and money, their relatives are outright worshiping war and confusing it for worship of Christ. Their presence as a foil doesn&#39;t exactly absolve the Gemstones; as we learn in a flashback episode, the relatives were put on this path because they lost all their money investing in Gemstone-branded Y2K-survival kits. Fittingly, the season&#39;s climax involves a plague of locusts descending on everyone, and a big explosion—fire and judgment. And yet it ends, as both the previous seasons have ended, on a bizarrely moving and warm family reunion, one that—judging from the presence of Peter Montgomery (Steve Zahn), a character we have just seen blown up in a truck—may be taking place in some kind of afterlife. The show chastens the characters rather than destroying them.<br><br> In part due to these callbacks and returns, which make each season follow the same reassuringly predictable rhythms as a church service, the show has at times felt repetitive over its three-season run (with a fourth <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/the-righteous-gemstones-renewed-season-4-hbo-1235449469/">on the horizon</a> ): further scandals, yet more troublemaking extended family, yet another conciliatory whole-cast finale. The characters, too, develop only in inches: McBride needs them venal and voracious enough to remain funny, but if they learn nothing at all from their often egregious behavior, the show becomes impossible to enjoy. The characters grow exactly as much as people tend to when they know they will have another chance. The show treats these apparent weaknesses by turns mockingly and sentimentally; the odd interplay prompts the viewer to think again about what forgiveness is, and what it&#39;s for.<br><br> Forgiveness is a fundamental part of any durable human social relations; sooner or later, even the best intentioned human beings hurt one another, and people need ways of recognizing and moving on from that hurt. Christianity takes this practice an extra step: Christ enjoins his followers to pray for their enemies, and to do good to those who hurt them, even when those enemies are still in the process of inflicting those wounds. But the tent-style revivalism practiced by Eli and Aimee-Leigh, built on intense appeals to sudden conversion, severs Christian practices of confession and forgiveness from churches and their representatives. If you are moved to repent in your heart, it says, you need not talk to a priest about it or make recognizable amends.<br><br> Revivalist faith is easy to mock—its rhetorical power can be hard to separate from performative salesmanship. But even an unbeliever might see the appeal of a religion that promises instant transformation. For the younger Gemstones, this promise initially comes not from a deep emotional experience but complacently, from their parents. Faith, to them, feels theoretical, an idea that forms the cornerstone of their lives but that&#39;s also untested. They seem tempted to push the boundaries of sinful behavior—Jesse&#39;s adultery, Judy&#39;s meanness, the entire family&#39;s materialism—to see if they will still be forgiven. They develop a conveniently weak sense of self: “And thank you, Lord, for forgiving me of my wrongdoings, which you know are not who I am,” prays Jesse in a first-season episode.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/06/the-chosen-jesus-tv-show/619306/">Read: Christian America&#39;s must-see TV show</a><br><br> TV critics in recent years have objected that the prestige-TV antihero, too, enjoys the forgiveness of viewers a little too easily. The idea is that we slip from finding a character like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/05/king-lear-shakespeare-succession-logan-roy/674205/">Logan Roy</a> or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2012/08/the-big-secret-of-breaking-bad-walter-white-was-always-a-bad-guy/261833/">Walter White</a> interesting to tolerating or even admiring them—and then, perhaps, their real-life analogues. For some viewers, this is probably true; think of the many <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2013/10/-em-breaking-bad-em-s-big-critique-of-the-macho-and-its-problem-with-women/280171/">Breaking Bad</a></em> fans who seem to have walked away from the show hating Walter&#39;s mildly judgmental wife, Skyler, rather than the meth kingpin himself. To the extent that such series do work that way, it is the characters&#39; charisma that motivates our forgiveness. For the characters of <em>Gemstones</em> , a background truth of their worldview is that God has already forgiven them before the shouting even starts. That existential cushion, paradoxically, seems to allow these defensive, vain, frail characters enough room to start to change their behavior, as in the unexpectedly moving second-season sequence where Uncle Baby Billy (Walton Goggins) meets the adult child he once abandoned and immediately returns to the wife and baby he is in the process of leaving.<br><br> Impious as the show is, the way it scrambles cause and effect aptly captures the weird, anti-dramatic quality of forgiveness. On <em>Gemstones</em> , someone has to tell you you&#39;re forgiven before you can start to make the sorts of choices that might render you forgivable. Part of the power of a good TV show is that it reminds us that rooting for characters and approving of them are not the same thing. Perhaps the same might be true of how we relate to the flawed, grasping people in our own lives. Or even to our flawed, grasping selves.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/the-righteous-gemstones-season-3-finale-review/674912/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/the-righteous-gemstones-season-3-finale-review/674912/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why So Many Americans Have Stopped Going to Church]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The decline is not just about religious institutions; it&#39;s about society itself. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/mJWGL_LStsN6RIwUGek5eNGhuQA=/0x227:4368x2684/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/GettyImages_172246108/original.jpg" alt="老妇人在几乎空荡荡的教堂里祈祷" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Jaap2 / Getty</figcaption></figure> <small><i>This is an edition of</i> The Atlantic <i>Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a></small><br><br> Church attendance in America has been on the decline in recent decades.

And the facts bear out that visual: As Jake Meador, the editor in chief of the quarterly magazine <i>Mere Orthodoxy</i> , notes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/">a recent essay</a> , about 40 million Americans have stopped going to church in the past 25 years. “That&#39;s something like 12 percent of the population, and it represents the largest concentrated change in church attendance in American history,” he writes.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-great-dechurching-who-s-leaving-why-are-they-going-and-what-will-it-take-to-bring-them-back-jim-davis/9780310147435?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Great Dechurching</i></a> ,<i> </i>a forthcoming book analyzing surveys of more than 7,000 Americans conducted by two political scientists, attempts to figure out why so many Americans have left churches in recent years. The authors find that religious abuse and corruption do play roles in pushing attendees away, but that a much larger share of the people surveyed indicated that they left the church “for more banal reasons,” as Meador puts it:<br><br><p> The book suggests that the defining problem driving out most people who leave is … just how American life works in the 21st century. Contemporary America simply isn&#39;t set up to promote mutuality, care, or common life. Rather, it is designed to maximize individual accomplishment as defined by professional and financial success. Such a system leaves precious little time or energy for forms of community that don&#39;t contribute to one&#39;s own professional life or, as one ages, the professional prospects of one&#39;s children.</p> As Meador notes, part of the problem is the unusual role that religion has come to play in some Americans&#39; lives. The <i>Atlantic</i> writer Derek Thompson <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/">coined the term</a> <i>workism</i> in 2019—and diagnosed himself as a worker under its thrall. “The economists of the early 20th century did not foresee that work might evolve from a means of material production to a means of identity production,” Thompson wrote then. “They failed to anticipate that, for the poor and middle class, work would remain a necessity; but for the college-educated elite, it would morph into a kind of religion, promising identity, transcendence, and community.”<br><br> Workism doesn&#39;t deliver on these promises, Thompson noted: “Our jobs were never meant to shoulder the burdens of a faith, and they are buckling under the weight. A staggering 87 percent of employees are not engaged at their job, according to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.gallup.com/services/190118/engaged-workplace.aspx">Gallup</a> . That number is rising by the year.” Even so, for those who have come to view work as the guiding principle of life, other priorities can quickly fall by the wayside. “The underlying challenge for many is that their lives are stretched like a rubber band about to snap—and church attendance ends up feeling like an item on a checklist that&#39;s already too long,” Meador writes.<br><br> At its core, the issue is not just church attendance, Meador argues, but rather what American society has become:<br><br><p> The problem in front of us is not that we have a healthy, sustainable society that doesn&#39;t have room for church. The problem is that many Americans have adopted a way of life that has left us lonely, anxious, and uncertain of how to live in community with other people.</p> Meador&#39;s point here reminded me of one of my favorite <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2023/05/social-infrastructure-public-space-community-relationships/674157/">episodes</a> of our podcast <i>How to Talk to People</i> , in which the hosts discuss the role of public spaces in building community. Places such as coffee shops, churches, and libraries can serve as truly shared spaces, where people mingle and make new friends. But even in those places, host Julie Beck notes, “I&#39;ve observed … a hustle and bustle.” People are “on a mission.” What she and producer Rebecca Rashid call “American efficiency culture” makes it so that we&#39;re just not incentivized to take it slow, sit down, and meet someone new. Beck is getting at the same point as Meador: Many Americans seem to have forgotten how to create truly deliberate communities with one another.<br><br> I&#39;ve painted a pretty negative picture thus far about the future of community and spirituality in America, whatever religion or practice a person might abide by. But a competing trend is humming along too: Some Americans are rewriting the rules for what an intentional or spiritual life can look like. As Wendy Cadge and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/elan-babchuck/">Elan Babchuck</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/us-religious-affiliation-rates-declining/672729/">noted</a> in <i>The Atlantic</i> in January, metrics such as church attendance might no longer be the most accurate proxy for America&#39;s religious affiliation. “Although participation in traditional religious settings (churches, synagogues, mosques, schools, etc.) is in decline, signs of life are popping up elsewhere: in conversations with chaplains, in communities started online that end up forming in-person bonds as well, in social-justice groups rooted in shared faith,” they wrote.<br><br> Meador, for his part, arrived at an ambitious way for churches to bring Americans back into the fold after reading <i>The Great Dechurching</i> . Maybe churches could better serve their members by asking more of them, he argues:<br><br><p> A vibrant, life-giving church requires more, not less, time and energy from its members. It asks people to prioritize one another over our career, to prioritize prayer and time reading scripture over accomplishment … Churches could model better, truer sorts of communities, ones in which the hungry are fed, the weak are lifted up, and the proud are cast down.</p> Creating an environment where people can ask more of one another, and give more in turn, seems like a wise rule of thumb for any community. If only American life didn&#39;t make such a prospect feel so daunting.<br><br> <b>Related:</b><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/">The misunderstood reason millions of Americans stopped going to church</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/us-religious-affiliation-rates-declining/672729/">American religion is not dead yet.</a></li> <strong>Today&#39;s News</strong><br><br><li> Donald Trump <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/03/us/trump-arraignment-news">pleaded</a> not guilty in federal court today to criminal charges related to conspiring to remain in office despite losing the 2020 presidential election.</li><li> A dead body <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/body-found-floating-barrier-texas-installed-rio-grande-mexico-says-rcna97910">was found</a> along river buoys in the Rio Grande, which were recently installed by Texas authorities to deter border crossings.</li><li> Firefighters <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/aug/02/california-york-fire-joshua-tree">are battling</a> California&#39;s largest wildfire this year as it continues to threaten the Mojave National Preserve.</li> <strong>Dispatches</strong><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/work-in-progress/"><b>Work in Progress:</b></a><b> </b>Experts were certain that America was headed for a recession.

The significance of this role could not have been obvious at the time, either to Novak (who was in high school) or to its victims, the bewildered patrons of Boston&#39;s Museum of Fine Arts. Novak had recruited a Romanian classmate with a deep voice, and together they&#39;d <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.boston.com/uncategorized/noprimarytagmatch/2011/11/23/b-j-novak-confesses-to-mfa-prank/">recorded an audio tour</a> for the exhibition “Tales From the Land of Dragons: 1,000 Years of Chinese Painting.” With the help of friends, they then slipped cassettes containing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tenderbutton.com/bmfa/bmfa.mp3">their tour</a> into the museum&#39;s official audio guides.<br><br> Art lovers must have wondered about the thick Eastern European accent that greeted them, over the twang of a Chinese string instrument. The Romanian soon became opinionated (“Personally,” he said, “I think this painting is a piece of crap”), then deranged. He alluded to his “disgusting anatomical abnormalities.” He called his listeners “decadent imperialist maggots” and confessed a desire to smash a glass case with a sledgehammer and “rip [a] scroll to shreds with my teeth, which, by the way, are extremely long and sharp … more like fangs than human teeth.” At last he offered an interlude of “idiot music” while he fumbled with his script. “This should keep you occupied, you drooling imbecile!” he bellowed at the listeners, by now either amused or complaining to management. The last several minutes were a cha-cha by Tito Puente.<br><br> Exit Novak from the stage of American fascism. (His last known political donation was $1,000 to Hillary Clinton in 2016.) But the Romanian has kept in character, complete with the peevish attitude and hammed-up accent. About the time Novak went on <i>Letterman</i> , the Romanian began posting on social media as “Bronze Age Pervert,” a mad-in-both-senses weirdo who had escaped the Museum of Fine Arts and now aimed to take over the world. His message, delivered in tweets, podcasts, and a self-published book, mixes ultra-far-right politics, unabashed racism, and a deep knowledge of ancient Greece. He has never shown his face or admitted his real name. But I know Bronze Age Pervert, and have known him almost as long as BJ Novak has. He&#39;s an MIT graduate who grew up in Newton, Massachusetts. His name is Costin Alamariu.<br><br> It is hard to convey precisely what BAP believes, in part because his views are so outlandish that even when stated simply, they sound like incoherent ranting. America&#39;s civic religion holds that all humans have inherent and equal worth, that they should not be graded according to beauty or nobility, and that they should not aim to destroy one another. BAP says this orthodoxy is exactly wrong. He argues that the natural and desirable condition of life is the domination of the weak and ugly by the strong and noble. He considers American cities a “wasteland” run by Jews and Black people, though the words he uses to denote these groups are considerably less genteel than these.<br><br> The modern state, he says, has been designed to empower the feebleminded and the misshapen at the expense of their betters. The strong and noble must humiliate and conquer their tormentors and destroy their institutions. On Twitter, where he has more than 100,000 followers, BAP posts images of seminude Aryan beefcakes, usually in tropical settings, to celebrate the physical perfection of the warrior element of the race that he hopes will someday be restored to dominance.<br><br> The world, or at least parts of it, has been more receptive to BAP than one might think. By now he is a leading cultural figure on the fascist right—among both elites, who have cottoned to his political philosophy, and non-elites, who love his brio and aspire to his erudition.<br><br> I consider myself a connoisseur of brilliant lunatics, and I have a high tolerance for their lunacy if it has compensating virtues of, say, humor or ingenuity. But even I find BAP worrisome. What starts as comedy can become something more sinister—and BAP&#39;s shtick, while sometimes hilarious, shows every sign of transforming into a new mode of far-right radicalism, with fans in positions of responsibility and power.<br><br> Typically philosophy books go unread even by the philosophers&#39; closest friends and family. But BAP&#39;s book, <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> (2018), tumbled screeching into the world, unignorable, at one point ranking among the top 150 books in the entire Amazon catalog. “It&#39;s still a cult book,” a former Trump White House official <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/23/alt-right-book-trump-1472413">told <i>Politico</i> in 2019</a> . “If you&#39;re a young person, intelligent, adjacent in some way to the right, it&#39;s very likely you would have heard of it.” His podcast, <i>Caribbean Rhythms</i> , has likewise won an avid following.<br><br> Only the most incautious admit their devotion. BAP tells his young disciples to burrow into government, to deny him publicly, to wait. Matthew Kriner, with the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, monitors the social-media activity of groups that are trying to ignite race wars and revive fascist movements. Their accounts have unsubtle Teutonic names such as Atomwaffen. “Bronze Age Pervert is across the vast majority of them,” Kriner told me. Moreover, he has an odd crossover appeal—among both extremely online misfits and figures with real-world influence. BAP, Kriner said, “represents that bridge to get you from really not-acceptable content to maybe ending up in someone&#39;s legislative activities, within a very reasonable amount of time.”<br><br> BAP&#39;s relationship to Donald Trump has been curious. He refers to the former president repeatedly, almost in the manner of a Homeric epithet, as a Borscht Belt comedian, a master of yuks. To BAP, Trump&#39;s chief virtue is destruction. He views the former president fondly, as a kindred insult comic, brazenly impious and generally right about race and immigration. The affection has been repaid in print by Michael Anton, a former Trump-administration national-security official who wrote <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/are-the-kids-altright/">a 2019 essay</a> in the <i>Claremont Review of Books</i> sympathetic to BAP, while noting his tendency to be “racist,” “anti-Semitic,” “anti-democratic,” “misogynistic,” and “homophobic.” Anton suggested (correctly, I think) that BAP&#39;s vile utterances, whether sincere or not, serve a purpose: to keep whiny leftists so busy cataloging his petty thoughtcrimes that they overlook his more serious heresies. Meanwhile, those capable of reading him without being rage-blinded quietly learn from him and heed his advice to bond, network, and plot.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/us-extremism-portland-george-floyd-protests-january-6/673088/">From the April 2023 issue: America&#39;s terrifying cycle of extremist violence</a><br><br> Anton wrote that BAP “speaks directly to a youthful dissatisfaction (especially among white males) with equality as propagandized and imposed in our day: a hectoring, vindictive, resentful, leveling, hypocritical equality that punishes excellence and publicly denies all difference while at the same time elevating and enriching a decadent, incompetent, and corrupt elite.” Anton, who was once a graduate student in political philosophy, ended his essay by prognosticating a BAPist future: “In the spiritual war for the hearts and minds of the disaffected youth on the right, conservatism is losing. BAPism is winning.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">BAPism, for all</span> its emphasis on bodily perfection, began as an intellectual phenomenon, and its first victories came in intellectual circles. They were so subtle that even the guardians of those circles recognized their enemy only after he was already within the gates.<br><br> Last year, at a conference of political philosophers at Michigan State University, a Yale professor named Bryan Garsten told his colleagues that they were in trouble. The topic of the conference was liberalism—not Ted Kennedy liberalism, but the classical version that predates the modern Democratic Party and indeed America itself. Liberalism is the view that individuals have rights and beliefs, and that politics involves safeguarding rights and making compromises when beliefs conflict. It has existed for only a few centuries and is by some measures the most successful idea in history. Just look where people want to live: the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, all liberal places that people will risk their life to reach.<br><br> But <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6kyGVHIJ0">Garsten said</a> liberalism had some of his best students hopping into rafts and paddling in other intellectual directions. He said they had been “captured” by the belief “that to be morally serious, one faces a choice.” The choice, he said, is not between liberalism and illiberalism. Liberalism had already lost. Its greatest champion, the United States, had run aground after pointless wars, terminal decadence, and bureaucratic takeover by activists and special interests. Garsten said his best students were choosing between the protofascism of Nietzsche and a neomedieval, quasi-theocratic version of Catholicism opposed to Enlightenment liberalism. These students considered liberal democracy an exhausted joke, and they hinted—and sometimes did more than hint—that the past few centuries had been a mistake, and that the mistake should now be corrected.<br><br> Some at the conference countered that these illiberals might have just not done their homework. “Your students need to become better readers,” said Diana J. Schaub, a political-science professor at Loyola University Maryland. But Garsten&#39;s illiberal students were good readers. Their deficiencies lay elsewhere, possibly everywhere but there.<br><br> Many of the participants knew that Garsten was talking about the threat posed by Bronze Age Pervert, though his name was uttered with great reluctance. Partly this reluctance came from political philosophers&#39; unwillingness to admit that they browse the Twitter feed of a genocidal nudist. Partly it was their worry that they had unwittingly been complicit in BAPism&#39;s spread by sending their students to intern in Washington, and to staff offices on Capitol Hill and in conservative institutions such as the Heritage Foundation.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/harlan-crow-clarence-thomas-relationship/674092/">Graeme Wood: Harlan Crow wants to stop talking about Clarence Thomas</a><br><br> From there, BAPism reached members of the right who lack philosophical training—young men whose main interest is not in the rise or fall of the American civic religion but in something more primal, an urge they themselves hardly understand, let alone control. “There is a level of self-loathing, chronic-masturbating anger out there among adolescent and early-20s fucked-up males,” one Republican operative told me. To them the world is dry, purposeless, and designed for the flourishing of anyone but them. Conservatism in the old way—not Bronze Age old, but Reagan old—does not satisfy them. “BAPism essentially involves re-enchanting the world and giving purpose to these young guys,” the operative told me. “And for some reason we can&#39;t.”<br><br> “Do you watch <i>X-Men</i> ?” Vish Burra, a 32-year-old legislative aide to Representative George Santos of New York, asked me recently. He said BAP&#39;s followers hid out in government like mutants in the Marvel Comics universe. (The leader of the mutants, Professor Charles Xavier, can put on a special helmet and scan the world for fellow mutants.) “The movement&#39;s coagulating, connecting,” Burra said, and only at private gatherings and parties will the BAPists on Capitol Hill confess their devotion. Someday, he said, they&#39;ll go public, with a “big reveal.” But that moment will not come until the BAPists “get in position first,” Burra said. “Why would I [reveal myself] before I&#39;m in front of the control panel?”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">After the museum prank,</span> almost 20 years passed before BAP&#39;s politics emerged into the light. And just as it did, the Romanian himself shrank vampirically into the shadows. No one seems sure where he is, or how he spends his days. But a sufficiently colorful and idiosyncratic personality is its own guarantee of detection. When I heard his podcast, it took me about 10 seconds to identify him.<br><br> Costin Alamariu is in his mid-40s, and he has never publicly admitted that he is BAP. (He did not reply to requests for comment for this article.) I met him only once, two decades ago, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after a mutual friend intuited that we might enjoy each other&#39;s company. Costin appeared one night wearing a dramatic overcoat—the kind whose wearer is begging for those around him to make a comment. I resisted. He had emigrated from Romania, he said, when he was about 10. That explained the Dracula note in his voice.<br><br> We spent that evening striding around Cambridge, having what I vaguely recall as a conversation that started with philosophy and then roamed widely over history, ethnography, and literature. Notably absent from our discussion was mathematics, then Costin&#39;s undergraduate major at MIT. He had a gift for finely titrated offense—just enough to appall me but keep the conversation going. He learned that I was studying Persian, and I said the grammar was startlingly simple, because its use as a lingua franca over several centuries had shorn it of many of its complexities. “Is it like Spanish,” he asked, in a mischievous deadpan, “where every time you say a word, you feel your brain shrinking?”<br><br> For many years, we corresponded. Costin&#39;s messages arrived irregularly, and the tone ranged from friendly and inquisitive to boorish and insulting. I went to South America on assignment. He sent long messages extolling the virtues of Joseph Conrad&#39;s novel <i>Nostromo</i> , which is set there. A friend who reads books like <i>Nostromo</i> , and can talk about them, is a friend worth putting up with. When I traveled to northwestern Pakistan, he suggested that we go in on a cabin in the mountains around Chitral and “plan the freedom of the Kalash,” an Indigenous Indo-Aryan people in the surrounding valleys.<br><br> About 10 years ago, he took to calling my friends “fags” and exhorting me not to “be a faggot.” At some point he had begun bodybuilding, and he sent me a picture of himself shirtless, with the message “Do you like this pic of me.” (He had asked me to keep our messages between us, and I continue to honor that request, with the exception of offhand remarks, comments he has repeated elsewhere, and publicly available facts. He must have sent the seminude thirst pic to others, because I have not shared it, but it has surfaced on social media.)<br><br> Eventually I decided that the book recommendations and ethnographic whimsies no longer made the slurs worth enduring. I let our correspondence trail off. I wrote to him when I discovered his BAP persona, and then it was he who stopped replying to me.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">BAP&#39;s origin story</span> begins at Newton South High School, outside Boston. Newton has an outstanding public-school system, and both he and the friend who introduced us were in a clique of edgy nerds and teenage intellectuals. In philosophy, the group favored Nietzsche; in music, Rachmaninoff; in politics, none of the above. They indulged in adolescent intoxication with ideas, especially the forbidden and obscure. This kind of extremism is a privilege of youth, because if you&#39;re still just a kid, you can idolize Che Guevara or Nietzsche all you like, and (usually) no one gets hurt.<br><br> Newton also has a large Jewish population. BAP has said on Twitter that he is Jewish, and this appears to be true. Costin has relatives who were interned in Nazi concentration camps. His older brother works as a geopolitical strategist at an investment research firm and has no detectable accent. Costin has kept his Romanian accent in private life. While in character, he speaks in what I believe is an intentionally bad Russian accent.<br><br> After high school, Costin went to MIT, where his father worked in the technology-licensing office. <i>The New York Times</i> once ran a photo of Costin, wearing his overcoat with Teva sandals, to illustrate the impaired fashion sense of MIT undergraduates. Upon graduation, he briefly worked in investment banking in New York, then began a doctoral program in political science at Yale—where he was a student of Bryan Garsten&#39;s. (I teach part-time in Costin&#39;s old department, where Garsten is a friend and colleague. Costin had left New Haven by the time I arrived.)<br><br> Faculty and graduate students from that era describe him as clever and manipulative. He wrote caustic letters to the student newspaper and contributed to <i>The New Criterion</i> , a venerable right-leaning cultural journal. He disappeared for long periods. He claimed he had been living out of a van in Argentina. No one was sure what to believe. His aversion to normal human company echoed Nietzsche&#39;s: “When I am among the many I live as the many do, and I do not think as I really think; after a time it always seems as though they want to banish me from myself and rob me of my soul.” When among fellow grad students, he mocked them and played tricks. One grad student took Costin seriously, only to realize, she told me, “Oh no—I&#39;m an idiot—this guy is just fucking with me.”<br><br> One of the best ways to conceal your genocidal fascism is to write about it openly in that most unread of documents, the unpublished doctoral dissertation.<br><br> Costin was always ready to talk about political philosophy, but he objected to attempts to enlist him in mundane campus politics. Others gathered signatures to denounce dictators during the Arab Spring. He humbly suggested that if petitions did not topple Hosni Mubarak, a well-attended candlelight vigil might. Yale&#39;s grad students attempted to unionize and to pressure the university to increase stipends and benefits. One wrote to a grad-student listserv with questions about the school&#39;s dental-insurance coverage. “My cousin Benko run Benko-Magnitogorsk Dental Emporium, he make good dental work in white van at Grand Av. and East St. in parking lot outside plumbing supplies store,” Costin replied. “You forward me small price of $100 he do work … steel teeth, gold teeth anything you want.” The email was an early exercise in refitting his character to needle and ridicule liberals.<br><br> His dissertation is a peculiar document. His adviser, Steven B. Smith, is often identified with the German-born Jewish philosopher Leo Strauss, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25alter.html">about whom Smith wrote an elegant book</a> . Strauss argued that great thinkers have embedded hidden messages in their writing, and the apparent meaning of their books and essays often contradicts the recondite meaning that only discerning readers can decode. The upshot: Read carefully, because things are not what they seem.<br><br> Costin&#39;s dissertation follows Smith&#39;s and Strauss&#39;s lead. It is eccentric even within this eccentric tradition, as Costin himself allows. He reads Plato in a Straussian style: Plato&#39;s teacher, Socrates, was executed for doing philosophy in a manner vexing to the Athenian state, so naturally Plato would have learned from that experience and written so that only the most perceptive reader could discern his true, subversive beliefs. At least one of those beliefs, in Costin&#39;s reading, is a doozy. Plato, taken by most readers to scorn tyrants, is read by Costin as their covert defender. “Philosophy and tyranny are fundamentally connected,” Costin writes, and their shared aim is eugenic. They seek “the breeding,” the “biological” production of genius, nobility, and virtue: a master race.<br><br> “There is much in this view that is frightening and even abhorrent to us,” Costin writes. Yet he states that Plato&#39;s claims are validated by the history of human cultures. For evidence, he offers a bizarre mix of folklore, history, and ethnography. The development of an aristocratic class, he says, demands conquest, the vanquishing of lesser races by the organized violence of the greater. As an example, he quotes Pierre van den Berghe, an anthropologist who described Rwandan Tutsis, an archetypal aristocratic elite, as “intelligent, astute in political intrigue, born to command, refined, courageous, and cruel.” His dissertation is dripping with admiration for these martial, masculine virtues, and for their feminine counterpart of beauty. He despises, in turn, farming and manual labor, the characteristics of a slave class.<br><br> One of the best ways to conceal your genocidal fascism is to write about it openly in that most unread of documents, the unpublished doctoral dissertation. The few who noticed considered it an intellectual exercise rather than an act of incipient fascism.<br><br> Costin&#39;s advisers were not alone in failing to take his Nietzscheanism as seriously as they might have. Dustin Sebell, a former acquaintance of Costin&#39;s from that period and now a professor at Michigan State, told me that political philosophy as a whole has been one big victory parade for liberalism for several decades now. “You have a tradition of reflection that has gone on for decades largely oblivious to these radical Nietzschean critiques,” Sebell said. “When those critiques resurfaced, many professional philosophers had little to say for themselves.”<br><br> When Costin began submitting his doctoral work, Smith, his adviser, became enraged. “I was shocked that his family would escape Ceaușescu&#39;s Romania only for Costin to undermine the principles of [American] democracy,” Smith told me. “I view that as a shameful act of betrayal.” He said he made his disgust known but ultimately signed off, and Costin received his degree. “I was his dissertation adviser, not his censor.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In 2015, Emory University</span> hired Costin for a postdoctoral fellowship, on the basis of less incendiary writing samples. His time there was a disaster. He acted erratically. At one point, he refused to give Emory&#39;s human-resources department his home address. During the spring semester, the university discovered that Costin had secretly stopped teaching his classes in person and was instead attempting to teach them over email. Further investigation revealed that Costin was medically unable to teach in person, with a vague but apparently real physical infirmity. His fellowship was not renewed. Later he lived for some time in Brazil, although he has been sighted recently in Japan, Spain, Hong Kong, and Iceland.<br><br> Within two years of his departure from Emory, <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> was published—a noxious, digressive summa that incorporated the conclusions in his dissertation, and added many others too outré for any but a self-published document. It is a narcissistic, 198-page love letter to himself, or to the philosopher-as-muscleman that his BAP persona purports to be. The tone approaches at times the onanistic genius of a young Norman Mailer, but much more resentful toward the modern world. “Perversions—lame ones—are born by the thousands and haunt, like myriad cripplette midgets in halls of mirrors, they haunt the world, books, the internet. Minds are lost. If you wait any longer everything will be pounded to garbage, there will be nothing left—it will all turn, the whole world will turn to a Bulgarian rest stop lavatory,” he writes. “I declare to you, with great boldness, that I am here to save you from a great ugliness.”<br><br> The “Bronze Age” element of his perversion refers to the earliest days of ancient Greece—an era of virile pagan militarism.<br><br> The “great ugliness” is the liberal bureaucratic state. Democracy, he writes, destroys “personal freedom and initiative” by elevating an unworthy caste of subhuman creatures he calls “bugmen,” who flourish only under these debased conditions, like roaches in a pit latrine. On his podcast, BAP praises the philosopher James Burnham, who wrote that the heroic age of capitalism had passed, and that a “managerial revolution” had elevated to power bean counters and bureaucrats (think of his supposed persecutors from Emory&#39;s HR department) over noble intellects and creators. Any person of talent or intelligence is ground down by this system, by “life under the thumb of the empowered old matriarchs and the conceptual dildoes they use to clobber the heads of young men.”<br><br> The ugliness extends to art and culture. Low dominates high. Screeching popular music drowns out Rachmaninoff. “From the point of view of real culture and refinement we&#39;re as barbaric as the most obscure herd of the Khwarezm [an ancient Central Asian people] where the women scratch their pubes in public.”<br><br> The “Bronze Age” element of his perversion refers to the earliest days of ancient Greece—an era of virile pagan militarism, before the moderns, and even some of the ancients, were beguiled into weakness. Men performed feats of intellect and strength unknown today: memorization of names and poetry, running flat-out for miles under heavy armor to impale enemies. These men prospered under “life at its peak,” which happens “not in the grass hut village ruled by nutso mammies, but in the military state.”<br><br> Then things get weird. BAP fantasizes about a near-apocalyptic cleansing:<br><br> Here is my vision of the true justice, the justice of nature: the zoos opened, predators unleashed by the dozens, hundreds … four thousand hungry wolves rampaging on streets of these hive cities, elephants and bison stampeding, the buildings smashed to pieces, the cries of the human bug shearing through the streets as the lord of beasts returns. Manhattan, Moscow, Peking reduced to ruins overgrown by vines and forest, the haunt of the lynx and coyote again. The great cesspool slums, Calcutta, Nairobi, all the fetid latrines of the world covered over by mudslides, overgrown with thick jungle, this is justice. The beings fit to rule this rewilded landscape are the neo-warriors, men of greatness and violence. “The only right government is military government, and every other form is both hypocritical and destructive of true freedom,” BAP writes. He considers Japan during the late imperial period, when the emperor was a martial god, an ideal political arrangement, and has written elsewhere that it is “the perfect model of national political life and national identity.”<br><br> BAP styles his book an “exhortation,” and ultimately he exhorts white people to form military units with deep masculine bonds, and together annihilate lesser races or throw them under the yoke. One could more easily dismiss BAP as a political shock jock, and his racism as cheap and tasteless subversion, if this section were not so obviously heartfelt. He mentions by name the white mercenaries who toppled governments for profit and pleasure in the 20th century. “The coming age of barbarism will not be owned, as so many of you urban cucks fear, by the gangbangers and the unwashed hordes of the teeming cesspools of the world, but by clean-cut middle-class and working-class vets, men of military experience, who know something about how to shoot and how to organize. The fools who think oligarchs will be able to control these men for very long should look to the fortunes of the Sforzas”—the Renaissance clan that controlled, then lost, the duchy of Milan—“and many others, and remember that money is no match for force of arms combined with charm.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">I asked Vish Burra,</span> the young Hill staffer, how BAP had charmed him. “The power, the vitality, the energy,” he said. “The left has stuck itself in a position of promoting a politics of sterility.” He said he didn&#39;t agree with everything BAP said, but he loved the vision, the verve, the relentless mockery of the bugmen.<br><br> The bugmen, as Burra suggests, are terrible at countering BAP&#39;s message. Liberals and leftists are used to sitting in a blind, watching for telltale signs of their enemies&#39; racism. There is no point in yelling “racist” at someone who is already yelling racial epithets at full volume. And there is, among BAP&#39;s fans, perverse pleasure in watching their critics passionately denounce their hero, to no discernible effect.<br><br> BAPists are not supposed to talk about being BAPists, and they even have a term of abuse for those who do: <i>facefag</i> . “He wouldn&#39;t appreciate a face—” Rather than utter the word, Burra sort of gestured at it, pawing the air. “He wouldn&#39;t appreciate a guy like me, but I&#39;m a big fan.”<br><br> BAP enjoys suggesting how close his followers are to the control panels. He posts pictures of their copies of <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> next to tokens of their power, such as US-government-official passports and patches, IDs, and other items from the livery of the Secret Service, Army Rangers, Department of Homeland Security, and Air Force. He allows one to wonder whether for every Vish Burra, who proudly keeps his copy of the book on the office shelf, there are others who adopt bugman camouflage. To be part of a clandestine movement, so extreme that it feels almost invisible to one&#39;s elders, is part of the thrill. “I mentioned him in class the other day; my students were shocked that I knew who Bronze Age Pervert was,” the Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen said at a conference in April.<br><br> A BAPist can take pleasure in having entered an exclusive cognitive club. One of his supporters wrote to me that BAP&#39;s character was layered with irony, and that the ability to see the truth in BAP, and separate it from the hilarious megalomania, is a kind of Straussian test, to determine who can read and think, and who is so offended by the racism, misogyny, and anti-Semitism that he is incapacitated and unable to focus on anything else, even to criticize it. “Nobody who has the IQ to listen to one hour of BAP without tuning out actually believes he recommends becoming an autistic nudist bodybuilder.”<br><br> I am not sure I pass that test. Listening to BAP, one gets the impression of florid insanity. He digresses as if not in control of his own thoughts. He barks insults and orders at subordinates in his recording studio, and one can reasonably wonder whether these figures are comic creations or psychotic delusions. He cannot possibly believe everything he says he believes.<br><br> BAP glorifies bodybuilding and devotes much of his Twitter feed to images of half-naked white hunks in the flower of youth. Allegedly this is to worship their vitality, their fitness for the aristocratic warrior class that the modern world has dishonored. He stresses that in ancient Athens, the cultivation of physical perfection was a privilege of the elite. Only citizens could train in the gymnasium. The process of creating an ideal male form was deemed beyond the station of lesser entities, such as women and slaves.<br><br> The parade of Adonises has led many to question BAP&#39;s sexuality. Bizarrely, Costin is not the only fascist I know who has been dogged by such rumors. Richard Spencer, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/his-kampf/524505/">my chemistry-lab partner in middle school</a> , faced persistent questions about his sexuality when he was a leader of the alt‑right. (If anyone out there can explain why homoerotic fascists keep seeking my company, please let me know.) Spencer told me, more than a little exasperated, that he thought the case for BAP&#39;s homosexuality had been proved. “If I had posted even one photo of some guy&#39;s ass on Twitter, do you think there would be any question in anyone&#39;s mind?” In <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> , BAP writes that the confusion of masculine bonding for homosexuality “is misunderstanding and exaggeration promoted by the homonerds of our time,” a poverty of our imagination and lack of friendship, “because we can&#39;t conceive of such intense love between friends without some carnal or material benefit in play.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/his-kampf/524505/">From the June 2017 issue: How Richard Spencer became an icon for white supremacists</a><br><br> The sheer length of time BAP has held his pose makes one wonder whether more of it is sincere than his followers think. As a character sings in a Sam Shepard play, “I believe in my mask: The man I made up is me.” The breeding of a caste of supermen is not just a pseudo-comic reverie. It is the subject of his dissertation. The fantasies of killing “lower forms of life” are not funny at all, not even as a lampoon of liberal excess. And while some people know BAP personally, and vouch for his intelligence and wit, few have emerged to state with confidence that he&#39;s not a fascist and racist. That is because he probably is one.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">What might it</span> feel like to experience the modern world as a “great ugliness”—an inverted kingdom of sniveling ass-kissers? “Society became something approaching mass concentration camp,” BAP has said on his podcast. “I&#39;m exaggerating only a little.” His rejection of this world is matched by his rejection by it. His classmates are successful; they hold good jobs. One by one, the adolescent Nietzscheans grew up into productive citizens, and put aside childish fascinations. The person who introduced us, now decades ago, was once so close to Costin that their friends described them as sharing something almost as deep as marriage. (They did not suggest the bond was erotic.) That friend has excelled in a normal life: a job at a tech company, a family, leadership in his synagogue. At some point he chose to be normal, which means rejecting BAP.<br><br> Liberalism&#39;s victory had been so overwhelming that for generations it grew soft, unaccustomed to the hard work of defending itself. Now a ranting nudist poses a real danger.<br><br> To take a job, to toil in the modern fields among the bugs and bugmen, is the greatest betrayal. No one respectable wants anything to do with someone who tweets out messages calling for “high violence” against the “kike and nigger” scourge.<br><br> BAP has responded to this rejection with bitterness, with what Milton called “a sense of injured merit.” I find his message melancholic. Recently he posted a video of himself in Rio de Janeiro&#39;s Botanical Garden, following around a wild bird. “Yes, hello,” he says. “Do not run from me. Come back. I love you.” I do not see much space for true love in the world he has built for himself, whose components are war, purification, and mutual masculine admiration ever fearful of its eros.<br><br> Fixation on BAP&#39;s monstrous qualities has, I think, led even his fervent admirers to overlook the most unexpected aspect of his philosophy, which is a literal belief in the transmigration of souls, as described in Eastern religions and the work of Arthur Schopenhauer. If this life fails, another will come. When the ironic pose drops, when the outrageous Boratism subsides, this conviction is what remains. “I believe reincarnation is fundamentally true,” he writes, in a section of his book that does not appear to be for laughs.<br><br> “I think that is the deepest layer of his outlook,” Dustin Sebell, at Michigan State, told me. “He believes in an esoteric version of metempsychosis, that our truest selves live on after death and take on different forms. He is profoundly unwilling to accept his own mortality.”<br><br> No humans receive praise higher than what BAP lavishes on noble animals like jaguars and birds of prey. He is taken, however, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201124-yukio-mishima-the-strange-tale-of-japans-infamous-novelist">the diminutive Japanese writer Yukio Mishima</a> . In midlife, Mishima took up bodybuilding and raised a squad of erotically intertwined neo-samurai warriors. When it became clear that Japan&#39;s managerial revolution had extinguished its imperial spirit, he attempted to overthrow the Japanese government and restore the power of the emperor. After that failed, he ritually disemboweled himself.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In Michigan,</span> when<span class="smallcaps"> </span>Bryan Garsten made his comment about the seductions of illiberalism, BAP was like the ghost at the banquet, cackling from the rafters at his professor&#39;s consternation. But the remarks went on longer, and they were also searching, and self-critical. Garsten told his listeners that they—he—may have failed to cultivate students&#39; imagination. His illiberal students, Garsten said, had learned why the Greeks admired Achilles, the fiery warrior. But they neglected the Greeks&#39; admiration for Ulysses, a subtler and greater model of manhood. Ulysses&#39;s greatness emerged not from his rejection of this world, but from his mastery of its constraints. He owed myriad debts to those around him: to his men, to his son, to his wife.<br><br> The students romanticized the tyrant, while assuming that liberalism bred sloth and laziness. “Life in a liberal democracy is full of demanding moments,” Garsten said at the conference. I had the impression that he was addressing BAP apostrophically, delivering a warning he wished he had delivered in person. “As far as I have read, life under tyrants is full of lassitude, selfishness, duplicity, betrayal.”<br><br> One could feel, over the course of these discussions, the stirrings of dormant liberal passions—as if the mere invocation of BAPism, after many years ignored, had inspired a counteroffensive. Another political theorist, a former Marine and a Brookings Institution scholar named William A. Galston, piped up to remind everyone that when liberalism had come under mortal threat in the Pacific theater, “Americans as a whole found it in themselves to do something.” Specifically, his fellow Marines charged, shot, and bayoneted their way from island to island until illiberalism, in the form of Japanese fascism, begged them for mercy. “Is there really an opposition between the open society and the virtue of courage?” Galston asked.<br><br> The defeat of imperial Japan illustrated the point nicely, I thought. But it also raised a much stranger question, about how liberals acquired such a reputation for sissydom in the first place. The Battle of Iwo Jima wasn&#39;t that long ago. But in certain spaces—academia, elite journalism—liberalism&#39;s victory had been so overwhelming that for generations it grew soft, flabby, and unaccustomed to the hard work of defending itself from a vigorous challenger. As such challengers left universities and newspapers, those institutions became self-congratulatory monocultures, inhospitable even to conservatives far less nutty than BAP. By now, a ranting nudist poses a real danger—of poisoning politics, splitting apart societies, and persuading otherwise talented people to spurn the modern world&#39;s greatest achievements, which are peace, tolerance, and prosperity.<br><br> The great Straussian Allan Bloom predicted doom for liberalism when these challenges disappeared. “The most essential of our freedoms, as men and as liberal democrats, the freedom of our minds, consists in the consciousness of the fundamental alternatives,” he wrote. An unchallenged liberal democrat, he argued, ceases to want to improve, unless he confronts his enemies in their most potent forms. Those forms will shock and humble us, he wrote, and have “the added salutary effect of destroying our sense of our own worth and giving us higher aspirations.”<br><br> To Costin personally, I have never been more grateful. His last message came during the pandemic. I asked how things were looking in Brazil. “Not bad,” he reported, with laconic caginess. He had not yet veered, as he later did in his public statements about COVID-19, into outright conspiracy theory and extended roasts of Anthony Fauci. Since then, I have come to think of BAP&#39;s performances in immunological terms: a gnarly virus that had lain dormant for decades in circles of philosophers and their unread books. Now that it&#39;s loose in the human population, it is a vicious kick to the liberal immune system. And that is not entirely bad. Unchallenged, liberalism&#39;s defenses waned, and liberals forgot, temporarily, why their cause was worth defending. The antibodies are stirring.<br><br> <small><em>This article appears in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09/">September 2023</a> print edition with the headline “The Rise of Bronze Age Pervert.”</em></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/bronze-age-pervert-costin-alamariu/674762/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/bronze-age-pervert-costin-alamariu/674762/</item></channel></rss>
