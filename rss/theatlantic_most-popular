(Randall R.) 认为特朗普的支持者真诚地渴望国家伟大：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">许多人支持特朗普的原因（如果你有礼貌地听听他们的话）是因为他们想让美国再次伟大，而在显赫地位和实现他们所说的目标的明显能力方面，没有其他人能与特朗普相媲美。面对当前存在的内部冲突，美国伟大的最有前途和最重要的部分。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">这是政客传播的一种幻觉，提供一种令人上瘾的快感，使人们与现实的某些部分脱节。它并不能让美国变得伟大。但让美国变得伟大，认识到它长期以来如何伟大以及如何变得更加伟大，仍然很重要。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">听听特朗普选民的心声：那些被忽视的人、那些悲痛的人、那些末日卷轴的人、那些想要有所作为的人、那些想要在一个更美好的世界里养家糊口的人。那些投票反对特朗普的人也符合这些相同的描述。对于特朗普分歧的对立双方来说，尊重对方的意见至关重要，这样我们才能在不被政治操纵者利用的情况下找到解决美国问题的方法。你我对我们各自的政治领域并不缺乏幻想。难道我们不应该重新审视这些幻想，而不是瞧不起特朗普的追随者吗？</p>鲍勃提出了民粹主义理论：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">民粹主义运动源于对文化和经济状况的普遍不满以及政府无力处理公众关切。这是有魅力的独裁领导人提供快速而简单的解决方案的沃土。尽管特朗普可能是一个品格低下的人，但对他的许多支持者来说，他似乎是一种需要的斗士——一个不遵守规则的人，因为规则被认为是问题所在。詹姆斯·麦迪逊会感到悲伤和失望。</p>贾莉拉分析了她认为特朗普支持者的动机：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">特朗普的支持者真诚地相信他是被陷害的，不仅因为多年来他一直在向他们宣传自己的信念，而且因为他们必须相信这一点，以免陷入严重抑郁。想象一下，你投身于一个错误的宗教，或者一个不成功的职业，或者一个糟糕的伴侣。想象一下，与你的终生朋友和强烈反对你的选择的成年子女失去关系。当你付出巨大代价致力于某件事时，很难承认你的承诺是徒劳的。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">我认为这么多人坚称特朗普是无辜的，这并不奇怪。当然，我确实相信他是一个骗子，腐败程度足以犯下他被指控的罪行。但真正的革命人物却总是因虚假指控而被关押。纳尔逊·曼德拉和圣雄甘地被指控、定罪和监禁。今天，大多数理性的人都认为他们的监禁是不公正的，国家有能力捏造证据来指控威胁社会秩序的公众人物。特朗普的支持者只是在不合理的背景下应用合理的想法。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">自由派和进步派似乎并不热衷于接受悔改的特朗普支持者。更换团队没有什么好处。这是一个非常高的成本。团结起来支持特朗普的城镇与自由派城镇一样热衷于取消文化。没有人愿意在教堂里面对一群邻居，或者在杂货店里被指控支持堕落。同侪压力可能让很多人守规矩。</p>丹认为，“大多数人认为选民会关注候选人的记录和个性”，但“真正重要的是候选人是否赋予选民身份。”他解释说：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">选民因为对候选人的支持而成为“某人”。特朗普在这方面比 50 年来的任何候选人都做得更好。对于那些世界被精英摧毁的选民，特朗普说：<em>你们很重要。成为这场运动的一部分，你就可以勇敢地面对精英。你可以和我一起恢复你的生活，并再次成为一个大人物</em>。特朗普的法律案件很容易被合理化，因为他个人愿意为代表所有认为他验证自己的生活并再次赋予他们身份的人而付出代价。对于他的支持者来说，他正在为“事业”做出牺牲。</p>克里斯托弗斥责特朗普的批评者，因为他认为特朗普的批评者不了解他们的国家：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">特朗普的支持者认为，经济和文化游戏被操纵了。特朗普的支持者不同意向小孩子传授性别知识，也不同意向易受影响的未成年人提供变性护理，并因此被贴上了贬义的标签。他们认为将佛罗里达州法律标榜为“不要说同性恋”——尽管大多数美国人可能会支持佛罗里达州为确保适合年龄的教育而做出的努力的内容和意图——是错误的。同样，当有人支持执法或反对平权行动时，他们就会被贴上“种族主义者”的标签，即使有原则上的理由提出异议。特朗普利用了玩被操纵游戏所带来的挫败感。特朗普的支持者认为特朗普正在挑战排斥他们及其观点的文化和经济体系。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">精英和媒体需要停止将特朗普的支持者视为边缘群体。特朗普在 2020 年获得的选票比奥巴马（2008 年）还要多，在 2020 年排名第二，仅次于拜登。 2024 年大选很可能即将结束。特朗普所涉及的问题并不是转瞬即逝的。</p>杰夫描述了他在科罗拉多州担任零售经理时观察到的一种选民，他在一家迎合特朗普投票人群的商店里观察到：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">他们是白人、工薪阶层，对事物非常了解并能解决它，但他们并不重视教育，因为教育在美国是系统化的。他们的日常用语非常违规，但总的来说是模范公民。对我来说，最值得注意的情绪通常是这样表达的：“投票给一位坐牢的总统不是很好吗？！”他们出于反应而为他辩护：这“不受欢迎”，并且他们对机器感到愤怒。想想支持尼克松是否是你能做的最“朋克摇滚”的事情。</p>帕特里夏分享了她如何成为民主党人，并描述了她观察到的一些特朗普支持者：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">我今年90岁了，是一名退休的医院管理人员。我和已故的丈夫在加利福尼亚州的共和党家庭中长大，并以这种方式投票，直到我们目睹了比尔·克林顿的弹劾，亲眼目睹了共和党的卑鄙和虚伪。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">从那时起我们就投票给民主党了。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">我的同祖母今年 89 岁了。她 22 岁时从阿根廷移民过来，所以你可能会认为她一闻到威权主义者的味道就认出了他们，但事实并非如此，她喜欢特朗普。她喜欢看<em>《学徒》</em>和《福克斯》。她的朋友们通过电子邮件传播他们在网上找到的疯狂东西。她拥有博士学位。从事教育工作并在大学任教多年。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">我有一位 65 岁的姻亲，住在加利福尼亚州奥兰治县，他的生意很成功。一个聪明人，但没有受过正规教育。他是特朗普的支持者，主要是因为税收。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">我的孙女和她的丈夫最近从西雅图地区搬到爱达荷州北部，因为他们不喜欢华盛顿州的规定。他们认为特朗普不是一个好人，但与自由主义非常一致——他们不希望政府干涉他们的自由，所以他们认为特朗普是唯一的选择。两人都是大学毕业生。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">除了他们之外，我还观察到，有些人似乎具有“遗传”特征，他们只是喜欢看到一个人“粘”在别人身上。特朗普特别擅长嘲讽。</p>尼克认为他年轻和右倾的经历帮助他理解了对特朗普的支持：<br><br><p> 2016 年之前，我认为自己是保守派。在大学期间，如果我试图对移民等话题发表不同的看法，我会感到被嘲笑和瞧不起。我决定我的两个选择是遭到蔑视或闭嘴。我知道我不是唯一一个。我的好朋友创办了一个俱乐部，将自由派和保守派聚集在一起讨论重大问题。他竭尽全力让保守派出现，但就是没能实现。我并不感到惊讶，因为我不认为我是唯一一个因为害怕被“取消”而无法分享的保守派，或者因为不遵循主流自由主义路线而被称为种族主义者或偏执狂。尽管特朗普有令人震惊的不民主和不道德行为，但共和党人仍然团结在他周围，因为他们在他身上看到了自己，一个保守派，不断因其信仰而受到自由派的嘲笑，除非他真正发声。我不认为所有保守派都是像特朗普一样渴望权力的独裁者，而且我认为他们中的大多数人也不同意他的观点。但我确实认为，当我们在某人身上看到自己时，我们会倾向于支持他们。身份政治在两党中都存在；也许我们看到的只是保守的版本。</p> T. 认为我们正在目睹对文化变革的反应：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">我是西部一座进步城市的建筑师。我讨厌唐纳德·特朗普，但我理解为什么我在田纳西州的姻亲毫无保留地支持他。让我感到困惑的是，我认识的许多聪明、自由派的人都不明白这一点。您还记得 2016 年大选后，希拉里输给了美国历史上最糟糕的总统候选人时，一片寂静吗？民主党人进行了几个月的认真自省，但很快就冷却下来，从那以后我再也没有听到过类似的声音。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">我认为我们缺乏理解是因为我们大多数人无法设身处地为弱势特朗普选民着想。你会看到一股席卷而来的政治、经济和文化浪潮席卷而来——它不仅代表着改变，还代表着对你生活方式的蔑视和对你自我意识的破坏。我并不是说这是真的，但印象是非常真实的。这是文化帝国主义，当我们谈论中产阶级化时，我们非常理解这一点，但当入侵力量来自我们这边时，我们就完全忽略了这一点。毕竟，如果我们面对的是一种嘲笑我们的宗教、吸走我们最聪明的年轻人并让他们相信我们无知无知、把我们出卖给全球经济、提倡对成千上万的人来说是禁忌的生活方式，我们会有什么感受？几年，如果我们不同意就取消我们？它符合过去 250 年来被现代工业社会蹂躏的原住民文化的经历。那些田纳西人正在被一个骗人的人卖掉一张货物单，但我们却陷害了他们。</p> JP 描述了他所爱的人对特朗普的支持：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">他们不参加特朗普集会，他们的外表或听起来也不像你在采访片段汇编中看到的那些可恶的特朗普支持者。他们富有同情心，对陌生人友善，甚至在各种政治派别的人中都有朋友。我们是一个种族多元化的群体：黑人、西班牙裔和白人。然而，这些人从骨子里相信，唐纳德·特朗普所说的每一个谎言，自由派媒体都会说得更多。对于唐纳德·特朗普犯下的每一项罪行，我们政治和文化中的自由派精英所犯下的罪行更多。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">至于他关于选举舞弊的指控，尽管缺乏确凿的证据，但他们内心深处认为他在某种程度上是正确的。我怀疑我能做或说任何事情来说服他们。</p>保罗描述了部落的吸引力：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">作为人类的一部分就是想要归属感。我们这样做的一种方法是认同某人或某事。热情的体育迷就是一个很好的例子。一旦我们将自己的身份、自我意识与这些团队联系起来，我们就会从积极的角度看待这些团队的一切。人们已经认同特朗普，现在他们的福祉和自我形象都与他息息相关。这使得他们无法看到他所创造的现实以外的任何现实。与他分手需要某种干扰，但看起来不会发生。当他们的身份面临风险时，最舒服的途径是留在特朗普身边并歪曲新数据以适应他们的观点。</p>迈克尔认为人口不安全是一个因素：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">我怀疑对特朗普的支持源于人们担心成为少数派并因与自己不同的人类的移民竞争而遭受经济灭亡。</p>蒂姆认为特朗普的诉求更加简单：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">给某人一个理由，让他们对自己的愤怒和怨恨感到满意，你就能赢得他们的忠诚。</p></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate>

Gardening]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>您不需要一个巨大的花园和园艺高手。只要在锅里放一个坑就可以了。<br>我的很多朋友都是我所说的“花园好奇者”。梦想很简单：拥有充足的后院空间，他们可以在那里种植自己的食物、堆肥，并实现他们最珍视的绿色生活理念。现实：时间和空间都是有限的。<br><br>但没有人需要等待完美的条件才能种植某种东西。根据我自己的“懒女孩园艺”经验，当我接受专注于我喜欢的食物的低风险实验时，我看到了最好的结果。我在我的公寓里种了西红柿、辣椒、生菜和香草。今天，我从种子开始种植的香蜂草和薄荷植物装饰着我的厨房窗台，在过去的两个夏天，我在我称之为“露台”的混凝土条上的容器中种植了金黄色的西红柿。尽管它在接下来的五年内不会结果实，但我的骄傲和喜悦是我从杂货店鳄梨核中种植的一棵三英尺高的植物。<br><br>适度种植蔬菜使我能够以小而有意义的方式减少与饮食相关的碳排放。我的植物让我省去了几次去杂货店购买从很远的地方运来的食物的次数。它也让我重新感受到了季节性。园艺，无论规模大小，都是彻头彻尾的放松。<br><br><br>即使您没有广阔的永久花园空间，也可以考虑遵循以下三个原则来开始。实用的公寓园艺是一种让<em>现在</em>生活得更好的练习，而不是等待合适的环境。气候变化太快，园艺的最佳条件可能就是您开始园艺的时候；关注植物及其生长方式会让你更了解这些转变。<br><br><strong>拥抱小事</strong><br><br>在以植物为基础的生活方式的世界里——想象一下遍布<em>《家居与花园》</em>页面的多汁龟背竹植物以及<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.popsugar.com/fitness/oprah-winfrey-video-her-gigantic-cabbage-on-instagram-47496524">奥普拉收获巨型蔬菜的病毒照片</a>——越大越好。与 HGTV 的后院丛林所制定的标准相比，我作为一名新手园丁，住在与两个室友合住的 1,100 平方英尺的公寓里，着迷地观看了 HGTV 的后院丛林，我种植的任何植物突然看起来都很贫乏。<br><br>为了与我圈子里的植物父母以及奥普拉竞争，我开始设计巧妙的方法在我有限的空间内种植植物。我的房间里几乎整面墙都摆满了植物项目：尝试在这里种植辣椒。在那里尝试各种西兰花品种。我什至在天花板上安装了两个吊篮，希望利用垂直空间来种植奶油生菜。有一天，我醒来，发现卧室的门打不开。如果我不开始往小处想，我就会生活在植物之上，而不是它们之中。<br><br>拥抱小植物不可避免地意味着拥抱容器园艺和非常适合它的植物。为了追求最大、最茂盛的蔬菜，我没有考虑它们对阳光和空间的需求。分布广泛的植物（生菜）、长得高大的植物（辣椒）或根系深的植物（胡萝卜）不一定是限制的理想选择。我抛弃了大而多叶的植物。我带着草药去了。<br><br> “当谈到让人们对园艺感兴趣时，我总是从草药开始，因为这是大多数人熟悉的东西，而且它们在狭小的空间里生长得很好，”佛罗里达州北部的环境园艺经纪人辛西娅·纳扎里奥-利里告诉我。<br><br>作为每天喝茶的人，我想种植可以轻松收获、干燥和浸泡的草药。这意味着可以全年在室内生长的薰衣草和以杂草般的速度生长的薄荷。这些植物在充足的阳光下茁壮成长，种植在不同的花盆中。当我越来越适应小规模种植时，我开始种植香菜和迷迭香，我经常用它们来做菜。当我的薄荷和香菜在寒冷的冬天开始枯萎时，我在浇水之间向它们的叶子喷水以保持水分。这种有意的关怀行为让我意识到自己的需求在冬天会发生怎样的变化，较短、寒冷的白天让我渴望阳光和温暖。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/08/tea-time/535590/">阅读：英国伟大的茶叶抢劫案</a><br><br>如果您一心想种植蔬菜，容器仍然可以发挥作用。但并非没有权衡。如果您不介意牺牲一些空间，使用大型花盆（五加仑或更大）可以让您容纳更广泛的具有不同根部深度和叶跨度的植物。织物种植袋是塑料盆或陶土盆的更轻的替代品，但会使植物变干，因此您需要更频繁地浇水。我最喜欢的容器园艺技巧是重复使用我本来会扔掉的容器。外卖容器非常适合，但您也可以使用塑料人造黄油或酸奶容器和牛奶盒。在底部添加一些排水孔后，您现在就有了一个坚固的容器，可以在其中开始蔬菜幼苗、繁殖观赏植物，甚至种植微型蔬菜。<br><br>如果您的目标是减少碳排放，那么容器园艺确实需要更多的思考，而不仅仅是将植物放在地里、阳光下。例如，我在所有容器中都使用有机、无泥炭的盆栽土混合物。许多商业盆栽土壤含有泥炭藓，通常来自加拿大的沼泽，这是特殊的碳汇。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/home/2023/04/05/peat-soil-mixes-harm-environment/">收获任何数量的泥炭都会对气候产生潜在影响</a>。正如 Nazario-Leary 告诉我的那样，“生长果实或花朵的植物需要大量阳光形式的能量”，因此在室内种植西红柿和辣椒等植物可能意味着您需要“投资购买优质的 LED 生长灯”。尽管 LED 灯泡比白炽灯更高效（白炽灯现在在大多数情况下已被<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/01/climate/incandescent-light-bulb-ban-leds.html">禁用</a>，但<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2022-05/GSL%20Backstop%20Enforcement%20Webinar%20May%204%202022.pdf">不适用于植物灯</a>），但这些能量输入会增加。<br><br><strong>斗志旺盛</strong><br><br>除了种子之外，您还可以用旧植物种植新植物。我没有扔掉杂货店根茎类蔬菜的尖端或末端，而是将它们放入水中以促进根部形成，然后将它们转移到阳光充足的窗户上的小盆中。在大流行期间，我们很多人都在玩这个：对我来说，它对大蒜、生姜、芹菜、大葱、生菜和土豆等主食特别有效。我现在定期重新种植杂货店大葱的白色尖端和一些生菜芯，这样我就可以在几个月的时间里收获剪下的烹饪用的东西。<br><br>使用食物残渣作为园艺材料是减少家庭食物浪费并延长食品杂货寿命的简单方法。 Anne-Marie Bonneau 是一位厨师和零浪费食谱作者，她定期回收食物残渣，直接重新种植食物或用作堆肥。<br><br> “当我在厨房里准备时，我不需要花任何钱就可以把葱或韭葱放在一边，浸泡在水中并在厨房里重新生长，”博诺告诉我。商业种植的蔬菜（尤其是土豆）上可能存在抑制生长的化学物质，但用肥皂和水彻底清洗即可去除这些化学物质。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/foraging-tours-medicinal-plants-popularity/674307/">阅读：觅食复兴的缺失部分</a><br><br>所有这些确实都有良好的气候数学。大多数在美国种植的农产品<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2022/08/30/cooked-newsletter-buying-local-food-sustainable">在出售前都要经过大约 1,500 英里的</a>运输。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/containers-and-packaging-product-specific">据 EPA 称</a>，容器和包装每年产生 8200 万吨废物。与水果和蔬菜相关的不可堆肥产品贴纸、网袋和蛤壳肯定没有帮助。博诺致力于无塑料生活，他为我列举了种植植物的优点；他们“消除了包装浪费，减少了你所吃食物的里程，并节省了一些钱。”<br><br>但园艺不仅仅是为了避免排放：最终，像这样的小实验只会少量改变你的碳影响。但我还是这么做了。我可能不会通过我的小项目改变气候，但我确实注意到我们的气候正在如何变化，并且因为我从事园艺而更深入地理解它。正如植物生态学家兼作家罗宾·沃尔·基默勒（Robin Wall Kimmerer）所写，“关注是与生命世界互惠的一种形式，睁开眼睛、敞开心扉接受礼物。”<br><br><strong>留在你的区域</strong><br><br>尽管我非常喜欢在公寓里种植植物的挑战，但经过三年的等待，当我收到附近社区花园的一席之地时，我简直不敢相信自己的运气。我不假思索地立即在我的新花园床上重新种植了我的室内药草实验——迷迭香、薰衣草、香菜，希望能够利用早春较长的日照和降雨。但一周后，我的大部分药草都变成了枯萎的卷须。<br><br>这个新花园是一个关于生长季节重要性的速成班。在我所在的新英格兰地区，直到五月，夜间气温都会降至冰点以下。我的迷迭香植物尤其没有机会抵御春季霜冻。<br><br>自从这次挫折以来，我开始痴迷于美国农业部的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/">植物抗寒区地图</a>，该地图根据植物生长条件对该国的每个地区进行了分类。区域编号越低，冬季气温越冷。在我所在的地区，耐寒区六、豆类、西兰花、生菜、花椰菜、黄瓜、茄子、辣椒和西红柿在五月至十月的生长季节表现良好。对于横跨第三区到第八区的太平洋西北地区的园丁来说，由于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/pnw548.pdf">海洋气候模式带来了更多的降雨，</a>冬季蔬菜生产成为可能。西南部六区到九区的种植者应该种植秋葵、辣椒和茄子等蔬菜，这些蔬菜在该地区炎热和阳光明媚的条件下生长良好。<br><br>室内园艺可以帮助控制温度，但根据你居住的地方，你可以种植的植物总会有一些限制。更加熟悉生长季节和生物区域让我对全球食品系统有了新的认识，这使我能够在 12 月享用热带芒果。现在，我根据我所在地区的生长季节吃得更多——尽可能优先考虑自己的食物和农贸市场，在寒冷的月份选择冬瓜和根类蔬菜——这促使我转向植物性饮食。对于普通美国人来说，在当地购买可能会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es702969f">减少家庭</a><a

5%，尽管其他饮食改变（即<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/vegetarian-vegan-eating-meat-consumption-animal-welfare/674150/">少吃肉</a>）是减少碳足迹的更有效方法。如果你种植一些香草，然后每天晚上吃牛排作为晚餐，那么你就没有抓住要点。<br><br> <a

href="https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-ma.pdf">生长季节</a>。这可能意味着生产以前难以种植的水果和蔬菜的机会，但也意味着更多的极端天气事件和可能破坏农作物的害虫。<br><br>园艺使这些变化对我来说显而易见。由于天气炎热，或因枯萎病和潜叶虫（<a

<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/02/china-million-covid-deaths-communist-party/673177/">阅读：一百万中国人会死而无人知晓吗？</a><br><br>在中美关系紧张的情况下，缺乏有关北京情况和决策的可靠信息可能会导致危险的误解。 “这是美中关系中的一个真正问题，”外交关系委员会专门研究中国政府的高级研究员卡尔·明茨纳告诉我。

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/neilthomas123/status/1684641904548282368">恢复</a>已删除的参考资料。与此同时，秦仍下落不明。自6月25日以来，他就没有在公开场合露面。<br><br>曾荫权将围绕秦的困惑归因于共产党倾向于将自己的利益置于国际社会甚至国家的关注之上。 “中国外交部长做什么或不做什么，或者他身上发生了什么，对世界其他国家都很重要，”曾荫权说。 “共产党，特别是其核心领导人，是否对世界其他地区的这一影响付出了很大的努力？不。”<br><br>中国观察家介入，通过对秦明显垮台的争论和猜测来填补信息空白。根据官方欺骗的经验，许多专家怀疑有什么险恶的事情正在发生。也许秦与党的领导发生了冲突，成为清洗的目标，或者因不明违规行为而受到调查。有报道称，秦与一家中文电视网络的一名记者有染，可能还有一个孩子。尽管中国最高领导人算不上道德典范，但如果这些个人缺点可能会危及共产党，他们就会皱起眉头。<br><br>但性丑闻事件也很可能完全是无稽之谈。到目前为止，秦似乎<a

Carnap, analysts at the Mercator Institute for China Studies, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://merics.org/en/comment/amended-anti-espionage-law-aims-curate-chinas-own-narrative">argued</a> in a recent paper that a newly amended anti-espionage law could target “almost anyone who exchanges information with international counterparts” and that the aim is “to make the Communist Party the sole narrator of China&#39;s story.” The state security ministry, in its first post on a social-media account, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/02/china/china-security-ministry-on-wechat-intl-hnk/index.html">encouraged</a> Chinese citizens to get involved in antispying efforts by spying on others.<br><br> Tsang argues that the trend toward greater secrecy is a consequence of Xi&#39;s centralization of power. “Unlike in collective leadership, when the top leader can hide behind collective decisions, there is nowhere for Xi Jinping to hide,” Tsang told me. Exerting control over information through secrecy allows a strongman to protect his stature and to claim infallibility: “If nobody knows what actually happened, you were never wrong, because they can never find evidence to show that you were wrong,” Tsang said.<br><br> But in truth Xi has often been wrong, and China is suffering for it. His policies have contributed to a sagging economy, hostile relations with most of the world&#39;s major powers, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/06/-china-pessimism-economy-censorship/674556/">growing pessimism</a> about the nation&#39;s future. With a shortage of good news to boast of, Xi preserves his political standing by wielding ever greater influence over narratives about China.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/06/-china-pessimism-economy-censorship/674556/">Read: The end of optimism in China</a><br><br> The effort to stave off criticism and bad news has led the leadership to treat topics of discussion that were once considered relatively safe ground—such as economic policy—as potentially threatening. To Minzner, the Council on Foreign Relations fellow, this rise in sensitivity toward formerly innocuous subject matter is evidence of a broader trend toward “securitization,” in which the system responds to economic and social pressures by locking down access to information. Put another way, according to Mood, the Communist Party&#39;s “political legitimacy, no longer supported by a growing economy, is now based on censorship to control information and knowledge.”<br><br> The thickening shroud of secrecy is a problem not only for policy makers around the world, but also for those governing China. Domestic officials responsible for addressing the consequences of the country&#39;s slowing growth and social pressures are not talking to one another, says Mary Gallagher, a specialist in Chinese politics at the University of Michigan. “I don&#39;t think the system is as responsive as it used to be, and I think that will be very problematic based on how many problems it needs to solve in the next five to 10 years,” Gallagher told me.<br><br> In other words, Xi&#39;s secrecy could imperil his ambitions for China and its role in the world. The Qin Gang mystery is thus a warning sign of profound and dangerous weaknesses in the Chinese political system that have emerged under Xi&#39;s rule and are likely to continue to deepen.<br><br> The Qin affair “points to this issue of elite instability that I think we&#39;ll see more of in China,” Gallagher said. “We don&#39;t know the process by which the next leader is going to be chosen, and we also don&#39;t know when the next leader will be chosen. That just makes the people who are jockeying for that position and of course the people around them just more prone to internal struggles.”<br><br> The world will likely have to guess at those machinations as well. “I really worry that we are moving into an era where people understand less and less what&#39;s actually taking place in China,” Minzner told me. “I find it very difficult to figure out how this gets reversed.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 09 Aug 2023 15:15:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/qin-gang-china-missing-foreign-minister/674954/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/qin-gang-china-missing-foreign-minister/674954/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Anti-California]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> How Montana performed a housing miracle <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/0M3YEVBin4tmioMgQs-kA-LKfK0=/0x0:4962x2791/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/bwGettyImages_1487414021_3/original.jpg" alt="科罗拉多州" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Justin Sullivan / Getty</figcaption></figure> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">, Monday through Friday.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small><br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n 2015</span> , a physical therapist named Nathan Dugan moved to Whitefish, Montana, and fell in love with the place. How could you not? The glaciers, the pine air, the small-town feel. Whitefish was always expensive: When he first got there, Dugan camped on and off for a month before he found an affordable home. But it got far more expensive during the pandemic, when wealthy retirees and digital nomads flooded the tiny town&#39;s tiny housing market. Out-of-staters were making cash offers on homes, sight unseen. Airbnbs started going for Bay Area prices. Rentals dried up. This has become a familiar story across America, where the housing crisis has gotten so severe that even rural communities in northern Montana are feeling the pinch.<br><br> Here&#39;s another familiar story: Seeking to capitalize on the real-estate gold rush, a developer proposed building a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/feb/07/whitefish-council-faces-decision-big-mountain-hous/">handsome 318-unit community</a> just north of downtown, on Whitefish Lake. The property would include a series of low-slung apartment buildings and townhomes, including units reserved for low-income families. Whitefish&#39;s residents freaked. Hundreds submitted letters to the town&#39;s planning committee. Local philanthropists, some billionaires, reportedly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/feb/02/donors-threaten-pull-support-if-whitefish-housing-/">threatened to pull</a> their support from local nonprofits if city officials did not <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2022/02/16/how-billionaires-helped-kill-a-housing-development-in-a-montana-ski-town/?sh=cc3d2e1d4b72">nix the proposal</a> . Nearly 200 people showed up at a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cityofwhitefish.org/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Minutes/_10212021-284">marathon public meeting</a> , one of several, to argue about, and mostly against, the project: It would look too tall, pollute the lake, pollute the night sky with light, change the neighborhood&#39;s character, stress the community&#39;s schools and medical services, destroy wildlife habitats, and increase traffic, which would interrupt snow plows and endanger families fleeing from forest fires. The town rejected the proposal.<br><br> Dugan was at that meeting and left incensed. “There&#39;s a gut reaction in places like this: <em>All development is bad, and we need to stop any development to maintain what we have,</em> ” he told me. “But the people who showed up to that meeting were all older and generally very wealthy.” They made it sound like the new development would ruin their lives, he said. But those people were doing fine. They already had a home in Whitefish.<br><br> Here&#39;s where things get different. NIMBYs have throttled the supply of homes across the country. In Montana, the state government was not just paying attention but primed to do something about it. At the same time that Dugan was steaming over his neighbors in Whitefish, analysts in Helena were worrying about the displacement of middle-class families, and politicians in Bozeman were hearing complaints about long commutes. “I can&#39;t do a town hall in any community in Montana and not have the affordability of housing come up,” Governor Greg Gianforte told me. “Housing prices have just been out of control.”<br><br> Last July, Gianforte created a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deq.mt.gov/about/Housing-Task-Force">housing task force</a> , bringing together homebuilders, politicians, experts, and advocates, including Dugan, who had gone on to found a housing nonprofit called Shelter WF. In October, the group delivered a series of proposals to state officials; in December, to local officials. Montana&#39;s legislature debated a set of bills based on those recommendations. Then it passed them this spring. The state transformed its land-use policies. It set itself up for dense development. It did this on a bipartisan basis and at warp speed.<br><br> Montana&#39;s just one state. But it did something—and maybe enough—to fix its housing crisis.<br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">ver the past decade</span> and change, the country&#39;s housing shortage has spread from coastal cities to suburbs and satellite cities to rural communities and small towns in the Mountain West, the plains, the interior South. Fannie Mae estimates that the country needs 4.4 million <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fanniemae.com/media/45106/display">more homes</a> . The National Association of Realtors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/biden-administration-takes-aim-at-america-s-housing-shortage">puts the number at</a> 5.5 million. But the country is not building enough homes to close the gap, or even keep up with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://usafacts.org/articles/population-growth-has-outpaced-home-construction-for-20-years/">population growth</a> .<br><br> Millions of families are stuck in apartments they do not want to live in, paying prices they cannot afford. Eventually, many decamp for low-cost, low-wage regions of the country. “Even before the pandemic, there was an increasing trend of people leaving expensive coastal areas like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York for more affordable places,” Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, told me. “Then the pandemic hit, and the trend accelerated.”<br><br> In recent years, that migration has buoyed or battered Montana, depending on how you look at it. The state&#39;s population surged 1.6 percent from mid-2020 to mid-2021, faster than that of 47 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2021-population-estimates.html">other states</a> . Montana added nearly 20,000 residents while it permitted just 3,000 new <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MTBP1FH">single-unit homes</a> . Home prices climbed by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MTSTHPI">nearly 50 percent</a> in a matter of months.<br><br> When the pandemic hit, Montana already had a housing shortage; in fact, it had a few of them. First, a dilapidation problem. Building new housing in Montana&#39;s rural reaches is expensive, which leaves many residents occupying decaying and at times dangerous units. (This is a particular problem on Montana&#39;s American Indian reservations.) “If you look at population numbers and counts of housing units in these rural places, it doesn&#39;t <em>look</em> that bad,” Andrew Aurand of the National Low Income Housing Coalition told me. “But when you look at the <em>quality</em> of the housing, the safety of the housing, and the extent to which families are doubling up, the housing crisis is severe.”<br><br> Second, the tight market in resort, gateway, and second-home communities. Coastal-city billionaires and rich retirees keep buying up ranches and lodges in Montana. Their shmancy consumer spending creates jobs. But the people working those jobs end up living in campers close by or in homes far, far away, because there is just not enough housing.<br><br> Third, a shortage of affordable homes in Montana&#39;s population centers, such as Billings and Missoula. “The math does not work” for homebuilders to create low-income housing anywhere in the country absent government subsidies, Jeffrey Lubell, the director of housing and community initiatives for Abt Associates, told me. The math especially does not work in Montana, where frozen ground shortens the construction season, and where a lack of skilled tradespeople drives up costs.<br><br> These problems collided with the state&#39;s pandemic-era population surge. “I started looking around and thinking, <em>Holy cow, prices are going up</em> ,” Christopher Dorrington, the director of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the chair of Gianforte&#39;s housing task force, told me. The state suddenly had a noticeable homeless population; town squares and vacant lots filled with tents in the summertime. All but the very wealthiest families started feeling strained. “You couldn&#39;t move, because supply was so short,” Adam Hertz, a real-estate developer and former member of Montana&#39;s house, told me.<br><br> Gianforte said that the answer was obvious to him: Montana had a supply crisis. It needed a supply solution. His task force soon figured out how to get Montana more housing: Make it possible for folks to build housing units by right, rather than having every development go through a miserable, expensive process of negotiation. Encourage dense development in already dense areas. Cut red tape. Indeed, Montana already had pretty loose <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/558.pdf">building regulations</a> , and legislators loosened them even further—functionally banning single-family zoning and preventing towns and cities from adding onerous zoning policies, among many other changes and investments.<br><br> “We obviously did not anticipate being able to get the big wins we did,” Kendall Cotton, the founder of the local think tank the Frontier Institute and a driving force behind the housing bills, told me. “We thought maybe there might be one bill that passed. We ended up getting almost everything that we were asking for.”<br><br> Montana&#39;s policies aren&#39;t perfect. There still isn&#39;t enough incentive for developers to create low-income housing units, experts told me. Housing costs won&#39;t decline immediately, because building takes time (and because high interest rates have frozen the development pipeline). Montana has weak tenant protections and too few resources for struggling renters, antipoverty advocates said.<br><br> Still, housing experts around the country are cheering. Montana now arguably has the most pro-development, pro-housing set of policies of any state. How did this policy phenomenon happen, and so fast?<br><br> The explanation has something to do with the nature of Montana&#39;s housing crisis, and something to do with the nature of Montana itself. The fact that so many people in such a small state found themselves affected at once pushed legislators to act. “We were victims of our own success,” Hertz, the developer and former state representative, told me. “We&#39;ve been having all of these discussions about how to get people to move to Montana and start a business here: <em>How do we get more tourism in Montana? How do we get tech businesses here?</em> We got the demand, and wow, we got caught totally flat-footed on the supply side.”<br><br> Politics, for once, helped too. Montana had lower housing prices and fewer roadblocks to development than other states to begin with. Republicans with a strong libertarian streak, like Gianforte himself, are a powerful bloc, and happen to be the kind of folks thrilled to slash red tape. Joining them were anti-sprawl environmentalists, student activists, urban-density advocates, real-estate developers, and antipoverty liberals, creating a coalition spanning from the far left to the far right. The fact that Gianforte pushed so hard on the issue and that Montana&#39;s legislature meets only once every two years put more pressure on those elected officials to get something big done.<br><br> Yet perhaps the biggest motivating factor—one mentioned by nearly every Montanan I spoke with—was California. Montana did not want sprawl ruining its wildlands, as happened in the Central Valley and along the Pacific Coast. Montana did not want San Francisco&#39;s sky-high inequality and huge homeless population. Montana did not want middle-class families squeezed out, as they were in Oakland and San Diego. Montana did not want to throttle its own economy, as the Bay Area did.<br><br> “If you have single-family zoning and bury your head, you will eventually face San Francisco&#39;s problems. It&#39;s not just the high cost of housing. It&#39;s a high cost of living, wealth inequality, homelessness, and crime,” Fairweather of Redfin said. “All cities should look at San Francisco as an example of what happens when you do nothing.” Montana did, benefiting from California&#39;s missteps and learning from its YIMBY advocates.<br><br> Many other communities are doing the same. Washington and Maine are banning <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/was-new-ban-on-single-family-zoning-exempts-some-of-seattles-wealthiest-neighborhoods/">single-family zoning</a> , as Oregon did in 2019. A number of cities are allowing single-room-occupancy buildings, getting rid of parking minimums, and letting homeowners build second properties on their lots. YIMBY groups are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/where-pro-housing-groups-are-emerging/">blanketing the country</a> , pushing for denser development. Dugan&#39;s is one of them. He&#39;s hopeful that the state&#39;s new policies will increase the housing supply in Whitefish, where he and his partner just—finally—bought a home.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 09 Aug 2023 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/rural-montana-housing-crisis-supply/674950/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/rural-montana-housing-crisis-supply/674950/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How to Be a Man in Iran]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Morality police have returned to city streets that have become a testing ground for women&#39;s rights and everyone&#39;s courage. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/uu-4WQeVOsfrvXnkOn7SRRWgTYM=/0x0:5637x3171/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/AP23210258268969_copy/original.jpg" alt="伊朗妇女" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Morteza Nikoubazl / NurPhoto / AP</figcaption></figure> After a months-long pause, Iran&#39;s dreaded modesty squads are back on the job of policing women&#39;s dress. Many Iranian men are quietly asking themselves and one another a question that goes something like this: “Suppose you&#39;re walking down the street with your hijab-less wife, girlfriend, friend, classmate, or sister. The morality police suddenly confront you, giving your companion a warning, or worse. What will you say or not say? Will you stand up for your partner?”<br><br> Distilled into one sentence, the oft-repeated question translates from Persian nearly word for word as follows: “When that time comes, Iranian man, will you be a hero, or will you be yellow?”<br><br> The death last September of a young woman named Mahsa Amini in the custody of Iran&#39;s morality police sparked an inferno of rage over issues both related and seemingly distant: ethnic and sexual discrimination, corruption, economic and climate mismanagement—all avoidable indignities in a country with astounding reserves of natural resources and a highly educated population.<br><br> The regime met the public outpouring with violence, arrests, and executions throughout the fall of 2022. And yet, the confrontation changed the human face of cities across Iran. Walk today in comparatively well-to-do quarters of Tehran, the capital, such as Karim Khan, Valiasr Street, and Vanak Square; or peek inside the theaters, cafés, and malls of Iranian cities all across the country; and you&#39;ll notice that more than the hijab has been discarded. The actual volume of cloth on women&#39;s bodies appears to be diminishing. Skin is in.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/iran-mahsa-amini-death-morality-police-protests/673108/">Mary Louise Kelly: Why I went to Iran</a><br><br> A change as visible as this one is a first in the life of the Islamic Republic, and in a sense, the regime allowed it by choosing not to enact a ferocious end game to shut it down. The same regime, after all, cut off past periods of turmoil, such as those in the summer of 2009 and the fall of 2019, by thoroughly quashing dissent. By contrast, the rebellion of 2022 produced what Persian speakers like to call a <i>khoruji</i> , or “exit,” though what it really connotes is “results.”<br><br> After Mahsa Amini, going without hijab has been transformed from an act of civil disobedience to a fact on the ground. Years ago, Iran&#39;s rulers made the mandatory hijab a “red line” never to be crossed. Now the question that dogs the system is what, exactly, to do when citizens cross its red line so matter-of-factly as to make the act utterly quotidian.<br><br> Last fall, as the protests receded, the Islamic Republic chose to show tolerance—if one can call it that—and removed its despised morality-police vans from city streets. The result was that, for the first time since the early days of the revolution, women with and without hijabs strolled side by side in Iranian cities. Large segments of Iranian society remain traditional and not only accept the hijab but choose to wear it; to see these Iranians together with those on the other bank of the cultural divide, openly sharing public spaces, was a novelty that took one&#39;s breath away.<br><br> This summer, however, the patrols have returned to the major thoroughfares. They no longer force women inside their vans and take them away, as they used to. Instead, hijab-less women are given a warning to put on their head coverings. Those who don&#39;t comply are filmed so that later, through facial-recognition technology, they can be brought to court.<br><br> The regime in Tehran is not used to yielding, except when it does. This summer, a video showing a patrol trying to force a young woman into one of its vans went viral. The authorities immediately put out a rather desperate notice on social media, saying that the video was fake and the morality police were staying true to their promise not to get physical with those they deem inappropriately dressed.<br><br> At 6 o&#39;clock one evening this summer, as the worst of the afternoon heat began to wane and people ventured onto the streets of Tehran, one of us  happened to be in Haft-e-Tir Square, among the busiest spaces in the city. Four women in full hijabs and five men, their colleagues, had created a gauntlet that pedestrians had to pass through to get to the other side. One of the men wore a vest with police insignia and held a camera. A young woman with long, wavy, uncovered hair approached the gauntlet.<br><br> A female agent stepped forward to remind her that Iran was an Islamic country and that she needed to wear a hijab. Unfazed, the young woman shot back, “I don&#39;t wear hijab.”<br><br> The female agent half-heartedly turned to her cameraman and bade him to start filming: “She&#39;s breaking the law.”<br><br> Before coolly continuing on her way, the young woman encapsulated the dilemma of the Islamic Republic: “How is it that the law is supposed to protect us from corruption and the wholesale stealing of public funds,” she said, “yet nothing&#39;s done about those things? Instead, all you people worry about is my hijab.”<br><br> Not everyone is willing to confront the morality police so directly, but even those who do not no longer seem particularly cowed. Many, when stopped, simply pull shawls from their bags, wear them for several steps past the uniforms, and then stuff them away again.

Will they do the same for autonomous vehicles?<br> <span class="smallcaps">A few weeks</span> <span class="smallcaps">ago</span> , Dan Afergan, a software engineer, met a few friends at 540 Rogues, a bar in San Francisco&#39;s Inner Richmond neighborhood. As Afergan and his companions nursed their drinks, someone walked in with some unusual news: “There&#39;s a Cruise out there with a cone stuck on it.”<br><br> Afergan stepped outside to check it out. Sure enough, a self-driving cab from the company Cruise, which is majority-owned by General Motors, stood frozen in the middle of the street, its hazard lights blinking. A bright-orange cone was perched on the robotaxi&#39;s hood.<br><br> “At the time, I thought it was a dumb prank,” Afergan told me later. “But one friend said, &#39;No, I&#39;ve heard about this.&#39; Until then I didn&#39;t know that there are a bunch of people who are anti–autonomous vehicles.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/7-arguments-against-the-autonomous-vehicle-utopia/578638/">Read: Seven arguments against the autonomous-vehicle utopia</a><br><br> The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/07/07/we-spoke-to-one-of-the-activists-coning-cruise-and-waymo-robotaxis-in-san-francisco/#:~:text=A%20group%20of%20San%20Franciscans,cone%20on%20the%20vehicle's%20hood.&amp;text=One%20member%20of%20Safe%20Street,a%20dozen%20cars%20so%20far.">“coning”</a> that Afergan witnessed was part of a campaign launched by Safe Street Rebel, a local activist group previously known for organizing protests in support of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/01/26/valencia-street-just-a-minute-pilot-protest">bike-lane construction</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sfstandard/video/7242746017781681454">public-transit funding</a> . Now its members have turned their attention to robotaxis. According to government data reported by the news site <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://missionloca.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DMV-numbers-on-AVs.pdf"><em>Mission Local</em></a> , Cruise and its rival Waymo—a subsidiary of Google&#39;s parent, Alphabet—together operate <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://missionloca.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/DMV-numbers-on-AVs.pdf">571</a> self-driving cabs in California. Users can hail them via an app. Service is concentrated in San Francisco, where the companies have been subject to a variety of limits imposed by the California Public Utilities Commission. The two companies now want the CPUC to remove those restrictions, despite objections from San Francisco&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-06-23/san-francisco-police-union-backs-sf-fire-chief-on-waymo-cruise-robotaxi-interference">police</a> <u>union</u> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sfstandard.com/2023/06/07/san-francisco-transit-chief-blasts-cruise-waymo-robotaxis-unsafe/">transportation</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/transit/sf-fire-chief-rips-cruise-waymo-ahead-of-possible-expansion/article_903ab0d4-1122-11ee-aafd-5745a3aacbe2.html">fire</a> departments about robotaxis&#39; troubling habit of blocking traffic and obstructing emergency vehicles. The commission has postponed a decision twice but is expected to vote tomorrow.<br><br> After realizing that placing a simple orange cone on the hood seemed to paralyze a state-of-the-art autonomous vehicle, Safe Street Rebel posted a TikTok <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/SafeStreetRebel/status/1676695665278337024?s=20">video</a> encouraging San Francisco residents to try it for themselves.<span class="smallcaps">一定不行。 We do not consent to this</span> , a caption declares over a clip of a robotaxi on a city street. As the video ricocheted across social media, Cruise and Waymo were unamused, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sfexaminer.com/news/transit/cruise-waymo-pan-tiktok-of-sf-cars-being-disabled-by-cones/article_7dd044ae-1cee-11ee-8a55-5b17abbb30dc.html">threatening</a> to call the cops on anyone who placed a cone on their cars.<br><br> One might dismiss the guerrilla-style coning of robotaxis as one more sign of an anti-tech backlash, or just of San Francisco being San Francisco. But those narratives understate the significance of the current uproar. For the first time, urban residents, tech companies, and public officials are debating whether and how self-driving cars fit into a dense city. This is a conversation that needs to happen now, while autonomous-vehicle technology is still under development—and before it reshapes life in San Francisco and throughout urban America. A century ago, the US began rearranging its cities to accommodate the most futuristic vehicles of the era, privately owned automobiles—making decisions that have undermined urban life ever since. Robotaxis could prove equally transformative, which makes proceeding with caution all the more necessary.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In the utopian version</span> of the robotaxi story, trips in autonomous electric vehicles become so affordable, easy, and pleasant that many people decide to forgo owning their own car. Because San Francisco is close to Silicon Valley and is home to so many investors and tech journalists, the city is a high-profile, high-stakes testing ground for the emergent technology. It&#39;s also a more challenging environment for autonomous cars than sprawling places such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/04/waymo-doubles-robotaxi-service-area-in-phoenix-in-bid-to-grow-driverless-trips-tenfold/">Phoenix</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/7/23496383/uber-motional-av-robotaxi-las-vegas-ridehail">Las Vegas</a> , which have fewer pedestrians, cyclists, and transit riders.<br><br> The novelty of self-driving cars is a key part of their appeal. “Tourists take pictures of me, so I get to feel like a small celebrity,” a San Francisco resident named David Anderson, who says he requests a Waymo ride multiple times a week, told me. Beyond the wow factor, these companies offer a service akin to ride-hailing, which researchers have found <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/uber-lyft-traffic-congestion-car-ownership-study/">worsens urban congestion</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-24/do-uber-and-lyft-really-drive-down-transit-ridership">pulls riders away from transit</a> .<br><br> Perhaps the most appealing argument for robotaxis and other self-driving vehicles is that human drivers are so fallible. Last month, a Waymo co-CEO published an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://t.co/SsJQwk0qEj">op-ed</a> in the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> extolling the safety of the company&#39;s vehicles, and Cruise ran <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/kvogt/status/1679517290847694848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1679517290847694848%7Ctwgr%5E27c05732b26210cfdd2f676a1f4b6938c8fbc5fc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fslate.com%2Ftechnology%2F2023%2F07%2Fcruise-autonomous-vehicles-safety-waymo-self-driving-cars-ad-new-york-times.html">a full-page ad</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> and other newspapers presenting its technology as a solution for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/traffic-crash-death-estimates-2022#:~:text=The%20National%20Highway%20Traffic%20Safety,42%2C939%20fatalities%20reported%20for%202021.">the 42,795 road deaths last year</a> in the United States.

For now, though, robotaxis are creating a slew of headaches for San Francisco officials. Even with limited deployment, the vehicles have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/06/30/cruise-robotaxis-blocked-traffic-for-hours-on-this-san-francisco-street/">blocked traffic lanes</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://t.co/KQlZ1y0QA8">obstructed buses and streetcars</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/29/23576422/san-francisco-cruise-waymo-robotaxi-rollout">driven over a fire hose</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://t.co/DVPVsXet8T">entered an active construction zone</a> . Since June 2022, San Francisco <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://t.co/rHiwDGEyPp">logged almost 600 instances</a> in which robotaxis made unplanned stops—some lasting hours—on public streets. That count was limited to incidents reported to city officials, suggesting that the actual number could be far higher.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/12/test-ride-waymos-self-driving-car/577378/">Read: Finally, the self-driving car</a><br><br> “These vehicles perform very well in basic suburban driving conditions, but they face challenges when cities have greater levels of complexity, and particularly when they are in unexpected situations,” Jeffrey Tumlin, the head of San Francisco&#39;s Municipal Transportation Agency, told me. “In a city like San Francisco, the unexpected is ubiquitous.” Jeanine Nicholson, the city&#39;s fire chief, offered a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2023-06-22/san-francisco-robotaxis-interfere-with-firetrucks-los-angeles-is-next">blunter robotaxi assessment</a> : “They&#39;re not ready for prime time.” Steven Shladover, a research engineer at UC Berkeley who has advised California officials about autonomous vehicles, told me that Cruise and Waymo vehicles sometimes show admirable sophistication. But, he said, “you&#39;ll almost inevitably encounter a situation where the vehicle will act like an inexperienced driver. It&#39;s an adolescent, not yet an adult.”<br><br> Cruise and Waymo have responded to critics by touting their vehicles&#39; overall safety record, which they argue is far superior to human drivers&#39;. “We should be doing everything possible to quickly and safely scale this technology and combat a horrific status quo <em>,</em> ” Cruise <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abc7news.com/sf-self-driving-cars-robotaxis-waymo-cruise/13491184/">declared in a statement last month</a> , after CPUC postponed its decision on easing limits on robotaxis. “Every single day of delay in deploying this [life]-saving autonomous driving technology has critical impacts on road safety,” Waymo asserted.<br><br> Robotaxi companies are under pressure to scale up quickly. Having invested billions of dollars, their backers want to see growth (the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/26/ford-vw-backed-argo-ai-is-shutting-down/">demise</a> last year of Argo AI, a prominent robotaxi competitor backed by Ford and Volkswagen, undermined investor confidence in the industry). Cruise <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/ceo-gm-cruise-thinks-driverless-110000708.html">is aiming</a> to put 1 million robotaxis on US streets by around 2030, and CEO Kyle Vogt <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://missionlocal.org/2023/08/cruise-origin-waymo-robotaxi-driverless-car-autonomous-vehicle-california-public-utilities-commission/">said</a> during an earnings call last month that “certainly there is the capacity to absorb several thousand [robotaxis] per city at a minimum.” (When I requested comment from Cruise by email, the company did not respond to my questions about its expansion goals.) Any delay from the CPUC— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/about-cpuc/commissioners/page-content/profile-list/commissioner-john-reynolds">one of whose five members</a> is Cruise&#39;s former managing counsel—makes the company&#39;s objectives harder to achieve.<br><br> Despite its current challenges, self-driving technology is steadily improving, inferring new lessons from reams of data collected from vehicles plying public streets. Eventually, robotaxis might avoid the kinds of traffic and safety hazards that have afflicted San Francisco. But even if robotaxis operate perfectly, what would life be like in a city where they are ubiquitous?<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Before gas-powered automobiles</span> arrived en masse, American streets bustled with activity. Pedestrians, horse-drawn carriages, and bicyclists jostled for space, and children played stickball, marbles, and other games on the pavement. Streetcars carried millions of passengers on <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://americanhistory.si.edu/america-on-the-move/streetcar-city">45,000 miles of track</a> ; in the 1920s, most of Chicago&#39;s nearly 100 streetcar lines operated 24 hours a day, with some providing service at <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-04-27/chronicling-of-the-collapse-of-public-transit-in-the-us">eight-to-10-minute intervals</a> in the dead of night. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://waterandpower.org/3%20Historic%20Photos%203/Spring_St_1902.jpg">Photographs</a> of urban thoroughfares at the dawn of the 20th century may appear chaotic, but the danger was limited, because no one traveled much faster than 15 miles per hour.<br><br> Early on, cars were too pricey for all but the most affluent urban residents. But after the introduction of the Ford Model T, US car sales <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/econ_focus/2003/winter/economic_history#:~:text=In%201910%2C%20the%20output%20of,to%204.5%20million%20in%201929.">surged</a> , rising from 181,000 in 1910 to 4.5 million in 1929. Traveling faster than anything else on the street, these vehicles soon presented a mortal threat to pedestrians and children. Some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/historical-fatality-trends/deaths-and-rates/">25,800 people</a> died in crashes in 1927, a per-capita fatality rate substantially higher than today&#39;s despite Americans owning far fewer cars at the time. “The dead were city people, they were not in motor vehicles, and they were young,” the University of Virginia historian Peter Norton wrote in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/fighting-traffic-the-dawn-of-the-motor-age-in-the-american-city-peter-d-norton/9780262516129?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Fighting Traffic: The Dawn of the Motor Age in the American City</em></a> .<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/car-devotion-motor-vehicle-deaths-danger/674613/">Read: Everyone has &#39;car brain&#39;</a><br><br> In the early 1920s, Norton recounts in his book, St. Louis and Pittsburgh residents erected immense memorials to those killed in car crashes. In Cincinnati, a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-Cincinnati-speed-governor-referendum-frightened-motordom-into-organizing-to-reshape_fig1_236825193">1923 ballot initiative</a> proposed a mandate that all motor vehicles within the city be outfitted with speed governors set to 25 miles per hour. “Forty-two thousand people put their names on petitions, just in that city,” Norton told me. “That&#39;s a sign that there were a lot of people troubled by car domination.” Alarmed, the auto industry rushed to mobilize against the Cincinnati measure, which was defeated.<br><br> Seeking to avoid debating whether fast vehicles could coexist with urban neighborhoods, the car industry worked with friendly government officials to reframe road safety as the responsibility of the individuals at risk of being struck. Car groups funded school <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/PeterNorton12/status/1684924437865328640?s=20">curricula</a> instructing children to stay out of streets and worked to establish<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/2015/1/15/7551873/jaywalking-history">jaywalking</a> as a crime. Meanwhile, city <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/archives/photos-work-in-the-20s-and-30s-widened-several-st-louis-streets/collection_7e157efb-3267-52c2-b337-733ac43205e1.html">sidewalks</a> and public spaces were torn up to expand traffic lanes.<br><br> Urban cars proved devastating for streetcars unable to navigate around a motor vehicle blocking their tracks. “The arrival of private automobiles quickly gummed up streetcar efficiency and made them much less competitive and comfortable,” Nicholas Bloom, a Hunter College urban historian and the author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-great-american-transit-disaster-a-century-of-austerity-auto-centric-planning-and-white-flight-nicholas-dagen-bloom/9780226824406?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Great American Transit Disaster</em></a> : <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-great-american-transit-disaster-a-century-of-austerity-auto-centric-planning-and-white-flight-nicholas-dagen-bloom/9780226824406?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>A Century of Austerity, Auto-Centric Planning, and White Flight</em></a> , told me in an email. “Streetcars lacked exclusive rights of way, so exploding auto traffic dramatically slowed streetcar service.” Automobiles also enabled many city residents to relocate to suburbs unreachable by transit. By the 1950s, American streetcar service had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/2015/5/7/8562007/streetcar-history-demise">collapsed</a> . In 1960, just <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1963042400">12 percent</a> of commutes to work occurred on transit; by 2019, the share had tumbled to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://t.co/zRsYNJZdEr">5 percent</a> .<br><br> The aftermath of these early auto-centric decisions still reverberates today, causing cities to become dirtier, more dangerous, and less fun. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/a/new-economy-future/cars-cities-technologies">More than half</a> of the land in many downtowns is used to move and store motor vehicles, occupying space that could otherwise accommodate housing, retail, playgrounds, and parks.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Many cities are</span> now taking steps to correct past mistakes. Last year, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://denverite.com/2022/11/14/initiated-ordinance-307-results-denver-deserves-sidewalks/">Denver</a> voters passed a referendum that will allocate millions of dollars to improve sidewalks. Striving to make public transportation competitive with car trips, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.yourvalley.net/stories/phoenix-plans-35th-avenue-as-first-bus-rapid-transit-route,387753">Phoenix</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.channel3000.com/news/local-news/madison-state-leaders-break-ground-on-city-s-bus-rapid-transit-system/article_a977a8c1-cc01-57bb-91fa-84ad374916a7.html">Madison, Wisconsin</a> , are planning their first bus-rapid-transit lines. (Such moves could have aided streetcars a century ago.) In recent years, California, Nevada, and Virginia have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/jaywalking-to-be-decriminalized-starting-jan-1/">moved</a> to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://americawalks.org/jaywalking-reform-progress/">decriminalize jaywalking</a> . Progress is gradual, but it is real.<br><br> Autonomous vehicles threaten that momentum, for the simple reason that self-driving cars are still cars. Whether operated by a human or software, automobiles generate pollution, require traffic lanes, and endanger pedestrians and cyclists.<br><br> One member of Safe Street Rebel told me he agreed with AV boosters that self-driving cars could make car trips easier than ever—which is exactly the problem (he asked to remain anonymous because of the dubious legality of the group&#39;s activities). “We have these two competing visions for the future of transportation,” he said. “We&#39;re now talking about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sf.streetsblog.org/2022/11/18/spur-talk-bury-or-tear-down-us-101-and-the-central-freeway">tearing down sections of freeways</a> in San Francisco, but AVs go completely against that, because they need that road space to go quickly. If we have more AVs, do we have to keep those freeways? Or can we invest in better transit, so we don&#39;t need those freeways?”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/car-accident/618766/">Joshua Sharpe: We should all be more afraid of driving</a><br><br> Norton, the University of Virginia historian, thinks the San Francisco activist&#39;s concerns are valid. “Once we have streets with robotaxis, there is definitely a risk that the city feels that it doesn&#39;t have to supply basic public transportation,” he told me. In fact, such views have already been shared. “Don&#39;t build a light rail system now. Please, please, please, please don&#39;t,” Frank Chen, a partner at the venture-capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/20/upshot/driverless-cars-vs-transit-spending-cities.html">told</a> <em>The New York Times</em> in 2018. “We don&#39;t understand the economics of self-driving cars because we haven&#39;t experienced them yet. Let&#39;s see how it plays out.” The year before, officials in Miami-Dade County, Florida, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article152473304.html">cited</a> autonomous vehicles as a reason to refrain from expanding public transportation.<br><br> But any suggestion that the vehicles will significantly improve mobility on their own seems fanciful. A few years ago, researchers provided 13 Bay Area volunteers with a personal chauffeur who would bring them wherever they liked, mimicking the experience of accessing a self-driving car. During their week with the chauffeur, the test subjects <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jalopnik.com/zombie-miles-and-napa-weekends-how-a-week-with-chauffe-1839648416">traveled a whopping 83 percent more car miles</a> than they did previously. Autonomous vehicles would be an environmental disaster if they induced anywhere near that much extra driving. They could also create unprecedented gridlock on highways and streets.<br><br> Shladover, the Berkeley research engineer, thinks such fears are overblown. “It depends on how the self-driving cars are used,” he said. “If they are deployed in ways that are complementary to transit, such as serving parts of the city that have minimal transit access, that is a significant plus.” But would for-profit companies focus on so-called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usnews.com/news/healthiest-communities/articles/2018-04-24/transit-deserts-a-growing-problem-in-the-us">transit deserts</a> , or would they cater to the needs of a smaller subset of wealthier customers? For AVs to complement transit lines, urban residents must be willing to hop into robotaxis with strangers.

That may remain true even when the cars are driving themselves.<br><br> In San Francisco, public officials and activists are raising fundamental questions about the desirability of autonomous vehicles within cities—questions that have seldom been aired in public. Instead, elected officials seeking an aura of innovation in states such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abc13.com/connected-and-autonomous-vehicle-cav-task-force/5102433/">Texas</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/20/595115055/arizona-governor-helped-make-state-wild-west-for-driverless-cars">Arizona</a> have actively pursued early AV deployments, minimizing regulations and shunning hard questions. Only now, in California, are robotaxi companies finding themselves in the unfamiliar position of playing defense in the public arena.<br><br> Regulators at the CPUC and elsewhere should encourage a vibrant public dialogue around autonomous vehicles, and learn from it. The worst thing they can do is rush decisions to scale an alluring new technology whose downsides could be catastrophic.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 09 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/robotaxis-san-francisco-self-driving-car/674956/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/robotaxis-san-francisco-self-driving-car/674956/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[I Was Wrong About Trigger Warnings]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Has the national obsession with trauma done real damage to teen girls? <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/USCD1PWDIZqx73rQbaHcE6W5flY=/106x0:2026x2400/648x810/media/img/2023/07/31/DIS_Filipovic_TriggerWarnings/original.jpg" alt="一本由玻璃制成、在绿色背景上破碎的黑白学生作文书的插图" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Danielle del Plato</figcaption></figure> I <span class="smallcaps">n 2008</span> , when I was a writer for the blog Feministe, commenters began requesting warnings at the top of posts discussing distressing topics, most commonly sexual assault. Violence is, unfortunately and inevitably, central to feminist writing. Rape, domestic violence, racist violence, misogyny—these events indelibly shape women&#39;s lives, whether we experience them directly or adjust our behavior in fear of them.<br><br> Back then, I was convinced that such warnings were sometimes necessary to convey the seriousness of the topics at hand (the term <i>deeply problematic</i> appears a mortifying number of times under my byline). Even so, I chafed at the demands to add ever more trigger warnings, especially when the headline already made clear what the post was about. But warnings were becoming the norm in online feminist spaces, and four words at the top of a post—“Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault”—seemed like an easy accommodation to make for the sake of our community&#39;s well-being. We thought we were making the world just a little bit better. It didn&#39;t occur to me until much later that we might have been part of the problem.<br><br> The warnings quickly multiplied. When I wrote that a piece of conservative legislation was “so awful it made me want to throw up,” one commenter asked for an eating-disorder trigger warning. When I posted a link to a funny <em>BuzzFeed</em> photo compilation, a commenter said it needed a trigger warning because the pictures of cats attacking dogs looked like domestic violence. Sometimes I rolled my eyes; sometimes I responded, telling people to get a grip. Still, I told myself that the general principle—warn people before presenting material that might upset them—was a good one.<br><br> Trigger warnings migrated from feminist websites and blogs to college campuses and progressive groups. Often, they seemed more about emphasizing the upsetting nature of certain topics than about accommodating people who had experienced traumatic events. By 2013, they had become so pervasive—and so controversial—that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/12/trigger-warnings-from-the-feminist-blogosphere-to-shonda-rhimes-in-2013.html"><em>Slate</em> declared it</a> “The Year of the Trigger Warning.”<br><br> The issue only got more complicated from there. Around 2016, Richard Friedman, who ran the student mental-health program at Cornell for 22 years, started seeing the number of people seeking help each year increase by 10 or 15 percent. “Not just that,” he told me, “but the way young people were talking about upsetting events changed.” He described “this sense of being harmed by things that were unfamiliar and uncomfortable. The language that was being used seemed inflated relative to the actual harm that could be done. I mean, I was surprised—people were <i>very</i> upset about things that we would never have thought would be dangerous.” Some students, for instance, complained about lecturers who&#39;d made comments they disliked, or teachers whose beliefs contradicted their personal values.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/do-trigger-warnings-work/585871/">Read: The real problem with trigger warnings</a><br><br> To a certain degree, Friedman said, this represented a positive change. Mental illness was becoming less stigmatized than ever before, and seeking care was more common. But Friedman worried that students also saw themselves as fragile, and seemed to believe that coming into contact with offensive or challenging information was psychologically detrimental. In asking for more robust warnings about potentially upsetting classroom material, the students seemed to be saying: <i>This could hurt us, and this institution owes us protection from distress.</i><br><br> Have we inadvertently raised a generation that has fewer tools to manage hardship?<br><br> Trigger warnings were only one part of a larger shift. Complaints quickly entered the wider culture, and were applied to “toxic” workplaces and “problematic” colleagues; students decried the “potential trauma” caused by ideas and objected to the presence of some speakers and works of art.<br><br> My own doubts about all of this came, ironically, from reporting on trauma. I&#39;ve interviewed women around the world about the worst things human beings do to one another. I started to notice a concerning dissonance between what researchers understand about trauma and resilience, and the ways in which the concepts were being wielded in progressive institutions. And I began to question my own role in all of it.<br><br> Feminist writers were trying to make our little corner of the internet a gentler place, while also giving appropriate recognition to appallingly common female experiences that had been pushed into the shadows. To some extent, those efforts worked. But as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/02/the-tragic-mystery-of-teenage-anxiety/673076/">mental health of adolescent girls</a> and college students crumbles, and as activist organizations, including feminist ones, find themselves repeatedly embroiled in internecine debates over power and language, a question nags: In giving greater weight to claims of individual hurt and victimization, have we inadvertently raised a generation that has fewer tools to manage hardship and transform adversity into agency?<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Since my days</span> as a feminist blogger, mental health among teenagers has plummeted. From 2007 to 2019, the suicide rate for children ages 10 to 14 tripled; for girls in that age group, it nearly quadrupled. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/pdf/YRBS_Data-Summary-Trends_Report2023_508.pdf">2021 CDC report found</a> that 57 percent of female high-school students reported “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness,” up from 36 percent in 2011. Though the pandemic undoubtedly contributed to a crash in adolescent mental health, the downturn began well before COVID hit.<br><br> Teenage girls report troublingly high rates of sexual violence and bullying, as well as concern for their own physical safety at school. But it&#39;s not clear that their material circumstances have taken a plunge steep enough to explain their mental-health decline. The CDC study suggests that, over the past decade, bullying among high schoolers has actually decreased in certain respects. Today&#39;s teenagers are also less likely to drink or use illicit drugs than they were 10 years ago. And even before pandemic-relief funds slashed the child-poverty rate, the percentage of children living in poverty <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/09/record-drop-in-child-poverty.html">fell precipitously after 2012</a> . American public high schoolers are more likely to graduate than at any other time in our country&#39;s history, and girls are significantly more likely to graduate than boys.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/facebooks-dangerous-experiment-teen-girls/620767/">Jonathan Haidt: The dangerous experiment on teen girls</a><br><br> So what has changed for the worse for teenage girls since roughly 2010? The forces behind their deteriorating mental health are opaque and complex, but one big shift has been a decline in the time teenagers spend with their friends in person, dipping by 11 hours a week—a decline that began before the pandemic, but was badly exacerbated by it. Since 2014, the proportion of teens with smartphones has risen by 22 percent, and the proportion who say they use the internet “almost constantly” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/">has doubled</a> . Part of the issue may be a social-media ecosystem that lets teens live within a bubble of like-minded peers and tends to privilege the loudest, most aggrieved voices; this kind of insularity can encourage teenagers to understand distressing experiences as traumatizing. “I think it&#39;s easier for them to artificially curate environments that are comfortable,” Shaili Jain, a physician and PTSD specialist, told me. “And I think that is backfiring. Because then when they&#39;re in a situation where they&#39;re not comfortable, it feels really alarming to them.”<br><br> Applying the language of trauma to an event changes the way we process it. That may be a good thing, allowing a person to face a moment that truly cleaved their life into a before and an after, and to seek help and begin healing. Or it may amplify feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, elevating those feelings above a sense of competence and control.<br><br> “We have this saying in the mental-health world: &#39;Perception is reality,&#39; ” Jain said. “So if someone is adamant that they felt something was traumatizing, that is their reality, and there&#39;s probably going to be mental-health consequences of that.”<br><br> Martin Seligman, the director of the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania, has spent the past 50 years researching resilience. One study he co-authored looked at the US Army, to see if there was a way to predict PTSD. Unsurprisingly, he and his fellow researchers found a link to the severity of the combat to which soldiers were exposed. But the preexisting disposition that soldiers brought to their battlefield experiences also mattered. “If you&#39;re a catastrophizer, in the worst 10 or 20 percent, you&#39;re more than three times as likely to come down with PTSD if you face severe combat,” Seligman told me. “And this is true at every level of severity of combat—the percentage goes down, but it&#39;s still about twice as high, even with mild combat or no obvious combat.”<br><br> In other words, a person&#39;s sense of themselves as either capable of persevering through hardship or unable to manage it can be self-fulfilling. “To the extent we overcome and cope with the adversities and traumas in our life, we develop more mastery, more resilience, more ability to fend off bad events in the future,” Seligman told me. “But conversely, to the extent that we have an ideology or a belief that when traumatic events occur, we are the helpless victims of them—that feeds on itself.”<br><br> Seligman also found that some soldiers who experienced severe trauma could not only survive, but actually turn their suffering into a source of strength. “About as many people who showed PTSD showed something called post-traumatic growth, which means they have an awful time during the event, but a year later they&#39;re stronger physically and psychologically than they were to begin with,” he said. But that empowering message has yet to take hold in society.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">So what would be</span> a more productive way to approach adversity? Friedman, the former Cornell mental-health coordinator, compares building resilience to physical exercise. “It&#39;s like any form of strength training,” he told me. “People have no hesitation about going to the gym and suffering, you know, muscle pain in the service of being stronger and looking a way that they want to look. And they wake up the next day and they say, &#39;Oh my God, that&#39;s so painful. I&#39;m so achy.&#39; That&#39;s not traumatic. And yet when you bring that to the emotional world, it&#39;s suddenly very adverse.”<br><br> The problem is that this idea—that to develop resilience, we must tough out hard situations—places a heavier burden on some people than others. Friedman pointed out that people who grew up under constant stress, perhaps owing to abuse, poverty, or food insecurity, may find that this stress is “erosive” to their ability to use those resilience muscles. The exercise metaphor rankled Michael Ungar, the director of the Resilience Research Centre at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Canada. “Chronic exposure to a stressor like racism, misogyny, being constantly stigmatized or excluded, ableism—all of those factors do wear us down; they make us more susceptible to feelings that will be very overwhelming,” he told me. There are, after all, only so many times a person can convince themselves that they can persevere when it feels like everyone around them is telling them the opposite.<br><br> Creating the conditions where resilience is possible is as much a collective responsibility as an individual one.<br><br> Tyffani Monford Dent, a clinical psychologist and an author whose work focuses on sexual violence and racial trauma, calls this “the resiliency trap.” Black women in particular, she told me, have long been praised for their toughness and perseverance, but individual resiliency can&#39;t solve structural problems. From Dent&#39;s perspective, young people aren&#39;t rejecting the concept of inner strength; they are rejecting the demand that they navigate systemic injustice with individual grit alone. When they talk about harm and trauma, they aren&#39;t exhibiting weakness; they&#39;re saying, <i>Yes, I am vulnerable, and that&#39;s human</i> . These days, patients are being more “transparent about what they need to feel comfortable, to feel safe, to feel valued in this world,” she said. “Is that a bad thing?”<br><br> Most of the experts I spoke with were careful to distinguish between an individual student asking a professor for a specific accommodation to help them manage a past trauma, and a cultural inclination to avoid challenging or upsetting situations entirely. Thriving requires working through discomfort and hardship. But creating the conditions where that kind of resilience is possible is as much a collective responsibility as an individual one.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">If we want</span> to replace our culture of trauma with a culture of resilience, we&#39;ll have to relearn how to support one another—something we&#39;ve lost as our society has moved toward viewing “wellness” as an individual pursuit, a state of mind accessed via self-work. Retreating inward, and tying our identities to all of the ways in which we&#39;ve been hurt, may actually make our inner worlds harder places to inhabit.<br><br> “If everything is traumatic and we have no capacity to cope with these moments, what does that say about our capacity to cope when something more extreme happens?” Ungar said. “Resilience is partly about putting in place the resources for the next stressor.” Those resources have to be both internal and external. Social change is necessary if we want to improve well-being, but social change becomes possible only if our movements are made up of people who believe that the adversities they have faced are surmountable, that injustice does not have to be permanent, that the world can change for the better, and that they have the ability to make that change.<br><br> To help people build resilience, we need to provide material aid to meet basic needs. We need to repair broken community ties so fewer among us feel like they&#39;re struggling alone. And we need to encourage the cultivation of a sense of purpose beyond the self. We also know what stands in the way of resilience: avoiding difficult ideas and imperfect people, catastrophizing, isolating ourselves inside our own heads.<br><br> In my interviews with women who have experienced sexual violence, I try not to put the traumatic event at the center of our conversations. My aim instead is to learn as much as I can about them as people—their families, their work, their interests, what makes them happy, and where they feel the most themselves. And I always end our conversations by asking them to reflect on how far they&#39;ve come, and what they are proudest of.<br><br> That last question often elicits a powerful response. I started asking it because I hoped to let the women I met feel seen in full, beyond the worst things that had happened to them.<br><br> <small><em>This article appears in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09">September 2023</a> print edition with the headline “The Resilience Gap.”</em></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 09 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/trigger-warnings-feminism-teen-girls-mental-health/674759/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/trigger-warnings-feminism-teen-girls-mental-health/674759/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Abortion Backlash Reaches Ohio]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A rare Democratic victory in the state shows the limits of Republican power since <em>Roe</em> fell. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/96KKsinuui57JYTWUFvpabh1PZU=/0x0:3600x2025/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/h_16069426/original.jpg" alt="照片显示俄亥俄州提前投票站外的“投赞成票”和“投反对票”标志" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Maddie McGarvey / The New York Times / Redux</figcaption></figure> Officially, abortion had nothing to do with the constitutional amendment that Ohio voters rejected today. The word appeared nowhere on the ballot, and no abortion laws will change as a result of the outcome.<br><br> Practically and politically, however, the defeat of the ballot initiative known as Issue 1 was all about abortion, giving reproductive-rights advocates the latest in a series of victories in the year since the Supreme Court overturned <i>Roe v. Wade</i> . Fearing the passage of an abortion-rights amendment in November, Republicans in Ohio asked voters to approve a proposal that would raise the threshold for enacting a change to the state constitution, which currently requires a simple majority vote. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-issue-1-special-election-abortion/674923/">measure on the ballot today</a> would have lifted the threshold to 60 percent.<br><br> Ohio voters, turning out in unusually large numbers for a summertime special election, declined. Their decision was a rare victory for Democrats in a state that Republicans have dominated, and it suggests that abortion remains a strong motivator for voters heading into next year&#39;s presidential election. The Ohio results could spur abortion-rights advocates to ramp up their efforts to circumvent Republican-controlled state legislatures by placing the issue directly before voters. They have reason to feel good about their chances: Since the Supreme Court&#39;s decision in <i>Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#39;s Health Organization</i> , statewide abortion-rights ballot measures have been undefeated, winning in blue states such as Vermont and California as well as in red states such as Kansas and Kentucky.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-issue-1-special-election-abortion/674923/">Read: The next big abortion fight</a><br><br> In Kansas last summer, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/08/kansas-abortion-vote/671029/">an 18-point victory</a> by the abortion-rights side stunned members of both parties in a socially conservative state. By the final day of voting in Ohio, however, the defeat of Issue 1 could no longer be called a surprise. For weeks, Democrats who had become accustomed to disappointment in Ohio watched early-voting numbers soar in the state&#39;s large urban and suburban counties. If Republicans had hoped to catch voters napping by scheduling the election for the dog days of August, they miscalculated. As I traveled the state recently, I saw <span class="smallcaps">Vote No</span> signs in front yards and outside churches in areas far from major cities, and progressive organizers told me that volunteers were signing up to knock on doors at levels unheard of for a summer campaign. The opposition extended to some independent and Republican voters, who saw the proposal as taking away their rights. “It&#39;s this &#39;Don&#39;t tread on me&#39; moment where voters are being activated,” says Catherine Turcer, the executive director of Common Cause Ohio, a good-government advocacy group that helped lead the effort to defeat the amendment.<br><br> Opponents of Issue 1 assembled a bipartisan coalition that included two former Republican governors. They focused their message broadly, appealing to voters to “protect majority rule” and stop a brazen power grab by the legislature. But the special election&#39;s obvious link to this fall&#39;s abortion referendum in Ohio drove people to the polls, particularly women and younger voters. “Voters don&#39;t spend a lot of time thinking about the Ohio constitution. They probably don&#39;t spend a ton of time thinking about voting rights,” Turcer told me. But, she said, “the attempt to dilute voter power so that it would impact a vote on reproductive rights made it really concrete, and that was important.”<br><br> Voters in South Dakota and Arkansas last year rejected similar GOP-driven efforts to make ballot initiatives harder to pass. But Ohio&#39;s status as a large former swing state that has turned red over the past decade posed a unique test for Democrats who are desperate to revive their party in the state. “We&#39;ve been beat in Ohio a lot,” Dennis Willard, a longtime party operative in the state who served as the lead spokesperson for the No campaign, told me. That Republicans tried to pass this amendment, he said, “is a testament to them believing that they&#39;re invincible and that we cannot beat them.”<br><br> The defeat of Issue 1 likely clears the way for voters this fall to guarantee abortion access in Ohio, and it will keep open an avenue for progressives to enshrine, with a simple majority vote, other policies in the state constitution—including marijuana legalization and a higher minimum wage—that they could not get through a legislature controlled by Republicans. Democrats, including Willard, are eying an amendment to curb the gerrymandering that has helped the GOP lock in their majorities. They also hope that tonight&#39;s victory will put Ohio back on the political map. “Us winning sends a message to the rest of the country that Ohio has possibilities,” Willard said. “And winning in November demonstrates to people that you can&#39;t write Ohio off anymore.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/08/kansas-abortion-vote/671029/">Read: The Kansas abortion shocker</a><br><br> For the moment, though, the GOP is in little danger of losing its hold on the state. It controls supermajorities in both chambers of the legislature; the Republican governor, Mike DeWine, trounced his Democratic opponent by 25 points last year to win a second term. One Ohio Republican, speaking anonymously before today&#39;s election, told me that the defeat of Issue 1 and the expected passage of the reproductive-rights amendment in November could actually help the party next year, because voters might no longer believe that abortion access is in danger in the state. (The GOP performed better last year in blue states such as New York and California, where abortion rights were not under serious threat.)<br><br> Republicans in Ohio, and in other states where similar ballot measures have flopped, are now confronting the limits of their power and the point at which voters will rebel. Will they be chastened and recalibrate, or will they continue to push the boundaries? It&#39;s a question the proponents of Issue 1 did not want to contemplate before the votes confirming their defeat were counted. Their critics, however, are doubtful that Republicans will shift their strategy. “It&#39;s unlikely that they will stop right away,” Turcer said. “It will take a number of defeats before they&#39;re likely to understand that voters do not want to be taken advantage of.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 09 Aug 2023 01:01:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-special-election-issue-1-abortion/674957/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-special-election-issue-1-abortion/674957/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[I’m Supporting Colombia Now]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> For its electric style and all that its players have overcome to reach the Women&#39;s World Cup, it&#39;s a no-brainer. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/TWooRl9bCWX25OvfVb8kHplYDyE=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/fifa_world_cup/original.jpg" alt="Colombia’s Linda Caicedo among four Jamaican players in a match at the Women's World Cup" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Asanka Brendon Ratnayake / Reuters</figcaption></figure> Fatalism can be a fan&#39;s best friend. When the United States&#39; women&#39;s team began this World Cup, I wanted the best to transpire, but my mind kept warning me that the team was destined for the worst. It was painfully evident that the squad wasn&#39;t well-coached and that injuries to crucial players left it unable to surmount bad tactics. From the opening game, I watched the rest of the tournament in search of another nation that I could adopt as my own if the US flamed out.<br><br> Spain caught my eye, with its intricate passing and stylish domination of the ball. And as an Anglophile, I was intrigued by England, until its star Lauren James <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/sports/england-star-lauren-james-gets-red-card-violent-conduct-egregious-act-nigeria">impetuously</a> sunk her cleats into the backside of a fallen Nigerian player, Michelle Alozie—and the English team rushed to soft-pedal the offense. But now that the US are out of the World Cup, there&#39;s one nation that every neutral fan of goodwill should fervently support, because of both its electric style and all that its players have struggled to overcome. That team is Colombia.<br><br> Although it&#39;s easy to laud the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-2023-nwsl-megan-rapinoe-alyssa-thompson/674816/">progress of the women&#39;s game</a> —and the success of the US women in their struggle for equal pay—many countries still treat their female players appallingly. And Colombia is arguably the most egregious documented example.<br><br> We know much of this because of the bravery of the country&#39;s midfielder Daniela Montoya. During the 2015 Women&#39;s World Cup, her team qualified for the round of 16, an incredible achievement for women&#39;s soccer in Colombia, which was still nascent. Her teammates didn&#39;t just fail to receive equal pay; they <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://globalsportmatters.com/culture/2023/06/28/colombian-national-womens-football-team-crisis/">reportedly received</a> no pay at all, merely a bit of help covering expenses. When Montoya complained to the press, her country&#39;s federation denied her a spot on the Summer Olympics squad in 2016. She later <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-usa-colombia/women-footballers-in-colombia-revolt-over-mistreatment-idUSKBN1QQ0F1">brandished</a> audio clips of a Colombian soccer official purportedly explaining that she was punished for having had the temerity to open her mouth.<br><br> Such wage theft is rampant in the Colombian game. One women&#39;s team, Atlético Huila, won South America&#39;s continental club championship, the Copa Libertadores. The players were told that they would collectively receive about $55,000 for their triumph. But the squad&#39;s winnings were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://globalsportmatters.com/culture/2023/06/28/colombian-national-womens-football-team-crisis/">apparently paid</a> instead to a businessman who financed the team. And like Montoya, the player who brought these complaints to the media was left off the roster of the national team, even as the pressure she helped apply forced the club to finally give the women their promised reward.<br><br> These incidents only add to the litany of official acts of disrespect: Players have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://assembly.malala.org/stories/colombian-womens-soccer">complained</a> that the national federation has made them pay for their own international flights and wouldn&#39;t even buy them new <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-usa-colombia/women-footballers-in-colombia-revolt-over-mistreatment-idUSKBN1QQ0F1">jerseys</a> . One powerful owner of a Colombian club, who also served in the nation&#39;s senate, once <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://as.com/futbol/2018/12/20/internacional/1545338936_774939.html">described</a> the women&#39;s game as a “petri dish of lesbianism.”<br><br> It gets worse. The technical director of the U-17 national team, which represents Colombia in international youth tournaments, allegedly abused the girls in his squad. According to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://colombiareports.com/amp/womens-football-in-colombia-harassment-blackmail-and-sexual-assault-of-minors/">allegations</a> leveled in 2019, he touched these teens inappropriately, propositioned them, and entered their hotel rooms without their consent. (Global Sport Matters, a project of Arizona State University, has recounted this in an excellent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://globalsportmatters.com/culture/2023/06/28/colombian-national-womens-football-team-crisis/">report</a> .) Again, the players who spoke up were frozen out of the national team. The technical director agreed to a plea bargain for admitting to a reduced charge but escaped any prison time.<br><br> Despite all that, at this year&#39;s World Cup, the Colombia women deservedly beat Germany, the No. 2–ranked team in the world. They have just eliminated Jamaica, advancing to the quarterfinals, where they will play a depleted English squad on Saturday.<br><br> The thrilling heart of the Colombian team is 18-year-old attacker Linda Caicedo, the revelation of this tournament, now frequently hailed as having the potential to be one the greatest players in the history of the game. She can beat a swarm of defenders on the dribble or scythe a defense open with a line-breaking pass. (Her <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KdC3RiEnY4">goal</a> against Germany was an impeccable display of footwork and is one of the best in the competition so far.)<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/us-womens-national-team-soccer-world-cup/674885/">Read: The end of the US women&#39;s soccer dominance</a><br><br> Even if she wasn&#39;t so immensely talented, she would be enthralling on the basis of her biography alone. At age 15, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer that required surgery. Despite her ailment and age, she continued <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/08/02/1191392108/colombia-linda-caicedo-world-cup">criticizing</a> the Colombian federation, her employer, for its poor treatment of the team. Her skills are so evidently extraordinary that the Spanish superclub Real Madrid transferred her into its rapidly improving women&#39;s side. Still, with Caicedo&#39;s medical history, a sense of her fragility is ever-present. Last week, before Colombia&#39;s game with Germany, a video captured her suddenly collapsing in the middle of practice, laying face down in the grass, with medics rushing to her attention. The team&#39;s official explanation was fatigue, but the episode captured the combination of sublime perfection and its contingency that make Caicedo such a sympathetic and ultimately irresistible protagonist.<br><br> What&#39;s perhaps most exciting about Colombia&#39;s performance is how it has connected with fans. The traveling Colombian contingent in Australia and New Zealand is one of the largest and loudest at the tournament. And that is an achievement unto itself: The women have succeeded in winning over their compatriots, despite the obstructions of owners and officials they have encountered on their way. That makes them, in a sense, the true heirs to the US women, who, in their prime, also changed public opinion by dint of both their courageous activism and their excellence on the pitch. Americans, embrace the Colombian team as your own.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 08 Aug 2023 22:22:38 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-x-rebrand-juvenile-internet-style/674875/">新名字</a>还没有被人们所接受——理论上来说，滚动浏览我的提要可能会达到某种催眠效果，为睡眠创造一个机会。就在那时我看到了模糊的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sciencecast.org/casts/suc384jly50n">视频</a>。其中，一块小而畸形的材料碎片，像铅笔折断的铅尖一样，神秘地悬浮在厚厚的抛光金属晶片上方。<br><br>我直接滚动过去。尽管关注了相当多的“纯粹的科学事物”聚合器，但在凌晨时分，我并不总是对启发感到兴奋。但几分钟后，我又看到了这个视频，然后是第三次。我注意到这不是对磁力的说教解释。这是新闻：漂浮的岩石是 LK-99，一种由韩国科学家团队合成的物质，他们认为它是一种室温环境压力超导体。<br><br>我想告诉大家，那天晚上<em>“室温常压超导体”</em>这个词对我来说很有意义，但没有。我对这句话感到困惑，就像猿猴审视着一块巨石。我寻找上下文线索。我数了数感叹号。经过几分钟的内心抵制后，我做了一些尽职调查，我的意思是轻松而睡眼惺忪地谷歌搜索。最终，通过一些努力，我了解到 LK-99 可能是材料科学家的圣杯发现。<br><br>但不仅仅是材料科学家！这与 2020 年在金星大气层中<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://a16z.com/2023/06/06/ai-will-save-the-world/">告知，</a>技术即将让我们摆脱痛苦和匮乏，你可以在 Twitter 上看到这一切。在特朗普担任总统期间，创造了<a data-event-element="inline link"

fooscrolling。<br><br>并非所有新兴技术都会导致 fooscrolling。当它的非凡力量可以通过一些立即可识别的视觉形式（例如双音聊天屏幕截图或漂浮的岩石）来展示时，这种行为就更有可能发生。更重要的是，要获得 Foomscrolling 的资格，新兴技术必须是能够合理提升物种水平的技术。 （阿波罗任务会导致无休止的滚动；想象一下，<em>地出</em>照片有 100

LinkedIn 一样。<br><br>也许这只是 fooscrolling 循环。最近几天，LK-99 粉丝群体一直处于不利地位。 <a data-event-element="inline link"

3:52。</em></small><br><br>乡村音乐是一种具有百年历史的怀旧、传统和乡音音乐流派，其风格从未如此流行。上周，<em>公告牌</em>百强单曲榜历史上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-number-one-hot-100-country-hits-top-three-1235382220/">首次</a>出现美国最受欢迎的三首乡村歌曲。对于这一里程碑的一个解释是，该流派的艺术家和观众最终<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/country-music-consumption-up-2023-morgan-wallen/">倾向于</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/music/news/cmts-morgan-wallen-country-streaming-march-1235573629/">流媒体</a>：今年，乡村音乐的听众人数增长了 20%，增幅仅次于拉丁音乐和韩国流行音乐。<br><br>但这是一场值得庆祝的奇怪胜利，不仅因为上周排名第一的歌曲杰森·阿尔丁（Jason Aldean）的《在小镇尝试》（Try That in a Small Town）已被证明是一个政治热点。现在突破的曲目每首听起来都不像<em>乡村</em>音乐。这种流派总是传达出一定程度的失败者的反抗，但最近，音乐和围绕它的对话有一种明显的怨恨色彩。<br><br>在《在小镇尝试一下》中，46 岁的佐治亚州流行音乐制作人阿尔丁向所谓的乡村价值观（荣誉、邻里关系、拥有枪支）致敬，警告听众所谓的城市病态（抢劫、向警察吐口水、焚烧旗帜） ）不要乘坐某些人所说的“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/06/a-note-about-trumpism-from-the-real-america/623689/">真正的美国</a>”。 “在这里，我们照顾自己的事情，”他夸口道。但音乐很难让人想起宁静的牧场或布满锯末的酒吧。当我听到这首歌中低沉的吉他声、低沉的小和弦以及从 Foo Fighters 的《Everlong》中摘录的即兴重复段时，我感觉自己回到了我的郊区男性青春期，大约是公元 2000 年——那时我穿着一件超大的黑色连帽衫，聆听带有灵魂补丁的男人的呻吟。 Aldean 的歌曲名义上是乡村歌曲，但其声音却是后垃圾摇滚另类摇滚。<br><br> 90 年代初，Nirvana 及其同侪为一种新的主​​流男子气概开辟了空间：容易受到失败和疏远感的影响，但又带有一种硬朗、嘈杂的边缘，没有人会认为这是<em>娘娘腔</em>。很快，一群<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/linkin-park-chester-bennington/561713/">旋律优美的</a>乐队出现了，比如 Bush、Creed 和 Nickelback，他们剪掉了朋克风格中的垃圾摇滚，为漫无目的的焦虑创造了一个广泛吸引人的模板。现在，阿尔丁用踏板钢和右翼谈话要点更新了该模板。<br><br>你可能听说过<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/jason-aldean-donald-trump/674842/">这首歌是有争议的</a>。阿尔丁设置了一个完美的话语陷阱，利用了美国当前在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/historians-clash-1619-project/604093/">其自身历史的两种理论</a>之间的分裂，以及强烈反对与反对之间循环的可预测性和盈利能力。尽管这首歌没有提及种族，但许多听众在其中听到了狗哨声：阿尔丁歌词所认可的“好男孩”私刑主义在历史上一直与<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2022/02/america-lynching-history-reckoning/621320/">白人至上主义暴力</a>联系在一起。他的音乐录影带包含“黑人生命也是命”抗议者的图像（尽管该片段<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/25/jason-aldean-controversial-music-video-edited/">后来被剪辑掉</a>），并在 1927 年田纳西州法院前拍摄，一名黑人在那里被私刑处决。（制作该视频的制作公司告诉<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2023/07/20/jason-aldean-song-video-pulled-cmt-controversy/"><em>《华盛顿邮报》</em></a>说它选择了“纳什维尔以外的热门拍摄地点。”）但对这首歌的批评只会放大它：乡村音乐电视台禁止该视频后，该曲目的流媒体量<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/jason-aldean-small-town-song-streaming-increase">猛增了 999%</a> 。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/04/jason-aldean-rearview-town-las-vegas/557876/">阅读：哀悼的音乐，无论它愿意与否</a><br><br>Aldean professes mystification at the dustup he&#39;s provoked.他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Jason_Aldean/status/1681382697875144717?lang=en">说</a>，这首歌只是“代表了我成长过程中对社区的感受”。 （无论如何，阿尔丁是在佐治亚州梅肯市的中等城市长大的。）这种坚持，比阿尔丁声音中南方轻快的声音更能让田径运动变得<em>乡村化</em>。阿尔丁所遵循的音乐传统是蔑视城市，同时颂扬乡村的干劲。但他并没有像梅尔·哈格德（Merle Haggard）的《Okie From Muskogee》那样讽刺而勇敢地演唱，甚至不像小汉克·威廉姆斯（Hank Williams Jr.）的《乡村男孩能生存》（A Country Boy Can Survive）那样生硬自信。他也没有像<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/toby-keith-the-bus-songs/540654/">托比·基思那样</a>发出挑衅性的口号。相反，阿尔丁听起来以一种明显的后垃圾摇滚方式沉迷和恐惧——尽管他的言语表明了行动。<br><br>也许这种升华的焦虑氛围反映了歌曲背后的悲剧：美国小镇长达数十年的经济衰退。阿尔丁感叹的大城市问题—— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-two-decade-red-state-murder-problem">暴力犯罪</a>、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/05/23/how-my-hometown-produced-jan-6-sedition-suspect/">煽动叛乱</a>，甚至<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/small-town-economies-culture/543138/">社区关系破裂</a>——在许多情况下，城市外的问题比城市内更严重。这一现实是右翼怨恨的主要驱动力，而与之相关的音乐无论如何都应该带有一丝不安。阿尔丁此前以无忧无虑的乡村生活赞歌而闻名（尽管他 2018 年的单曲《后景小镇》看起来几乎像是乡村梦想的挽歌，但实际上是一首分手歌曲）。 《Small Town》的一个更好的先例是 Staind 2001 年的热门单曲《It&#39;s Been Awhile》：“已经有一段时间了/自从我能昂首挺胸以来。”并非巧合的是，斯坦德的亚伦·刘易斯现在是一位受欢迎的乡村音乐家，也是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article252897928.html">人们记忆中最有影响力的右翼抗议歌手</a>之一。<br><br>摩根·沃伦 (Morgan Wallen) 是 Nickelback 的精神之子，这也并非巧合。摩根·沃伦目前是最受欢迎的乡村音乐人，也是上周热门 100 强歌曲《最后一夜》(Last Night) 的歌手。这支加拿大摇滚乐队以朗朗上口的《How You Remind Me》和《Photograph》而闻名，经常被嘲笑<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/rahm-emanuel-saves-reputation-renounces-nickelback/323749/">为音乐平淡的终极典范</a>。但沃伦毫无歉意地指出该组织的影响力。他的首选制作人乔伊·莫伊 (Joey Moi) 制作了 Nickelback 2000 年代早期的许多热门歌曲，其中包括《Photograph》，然后与他人共同创立了 Big Loud，该公司现在是纳什维尔最热门的唱片公司之一。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/country-music-pandemic-protests-the-chicks-gaslighter/614092/">阅读：乡村音乐不能再隐藏它的问题</a><br><br>Wallen 是一位 30 岁的前<em>《好声音》</em>参赛者，是一位严肃的流行音乐天才，而《Last Night》（自 2 月份发行以来就引起轰动）非常出色（这也解释了为什么它取代了 Aldean 的歌曲登上了 Hot 100 的榜首）今天）。制作的层压性质以及歌手表达对自己的轻微仇恨的方式有一点五分钱乐队的品质，但“最后一夜”主要体现了纳什维尔的一种独立趋势：所谓的嘻哈、现代乡村受到说唱的影响。沃伦用轻快的吉他循环和拍手形成切分节拍，以时髦的口音唱着醉酒的争斗与和解，散发着与德雷克相同的低俗魅力。这里的讽刺是显而易见的：2021 年，沃伦被发现在镜头前说出 N 字词，这导致了一场所谓的“取消”，就像阿尔丁的那样，只会增加他的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/02/morgan-wallen/618137/">听众数量</a>。<br><br>上周全国排名第三的歌曲是卢克·库姆斯 (Luke Combs) 对特雷西·查普曼 (Tracy Chapman) 的《Fast Car》的演绎，也引起了一些争议。它基本上是 1988 年经典歌曲的逐字翻唱，主要区别在于库姆斯粗犷而优美的声音。上个月它在排行榜上开始上升后，一些评论员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-cover/">指出</a>，查普曼和其他黑人女性都没有在乡村音乐领域取得过库姆斯所享受的那种成功。这一观察激起了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-another-week-another-country-music-star-falsely-accused-racism">保守派的不满</a>，这比最初的批评更强烈，可能会提高这首歌的受欢迎程度。正如我的同事康纳·弗里德斯多夫（Conor Friedersdorf） <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/why-is-tracy-chapman-at-the-center-of-a-country-music-controversy/674794/">所说</a>，围绕这首歌的讨论表明，媒体对种族的报道可能会引发更多的混乱，而不是改革。<br><br>但要求这种注重真实性、纯美国风格的观察者避免谈论明显的事实是否站得住脚？上周乡村音乐席卷<em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 的事实是显而易见的。音乐多种多样，但表演者却不然：在阿尔丁的抗议摇滚、沃伦悠闲的说唱流和库姆斯的灵魂民谣翻唱之间，主流乡村音乐的繁荣不是源于声音，而是源于白人、男性和——至少在阿尔丁的例子中——受屈的身份。当然，所有类型都是由人口统计数据定义的。但流媒体技术，更不用说社交和政治媒体，现在奖励了煽动多元化的激情，包括播下分裂的种子。煽动斯坦对斯坦，或右对左，可以证明是有利可图的——至少在短时间内是这样（阿尔丁的歌曲今天在百强单曲榜上从第 1 名跌至第 21 名）。<br><br>其他流派的艺术家将从这一繁荣中吸取教训。就在几天前，阿尔丁出人意料地出现在纳什维尔举行的五分钱乐队音乐会上。 Nickelback 的主唱查德·克罗格 (Chad Kroeger) 从来不因其政治直言不讳而闻名。但那天晚上，他<a data-event-element="inline link"
