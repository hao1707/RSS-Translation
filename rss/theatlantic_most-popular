18 人，指控其密谋推翻该州 2020 年总统选举结果。被指控的同谋提醒人们，像特朗普这样的人是受到小人物的支持，这些小人物可能与特朗普本人一样对民主构成威胁。<br><br>首先，这是来自<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>的三个新故事：<br><br><li><a

2020 年大选中带头推翻该州选民的意愿。关于特朗普本人，我们可以说的不多了：我们只能多次指出，他是一个<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/donald-trump-not-well/597640/">情绪失常的</a>人，被狂野的不安全感所困扰，用退休联邦法官 J·迈克尔·卢蒂格 (J. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/conservative-retired-judge-says-trump-corroded-and-corrupted-american-democracy">Michael Luttig)</a>的话说，他的行为“腐蚀并损害了特朗普的利益”。腐败的美国民主。”因此，让我们把他放在一边，转向他在佐治亚州被指控的同谋（ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/08/trump-indictment-charges-overturn-2020-election/674887/">特别检察官杰克史密斯的起诉书</a>中似乎提到了其中至少五人，指控特朗普密谋推翻 2020 年大选结果，尽管史密斯还没有向他们收费）。<br><br>佐治亚州的起诉书描述了一个看起来很像多层次营销计划的所谓诈骗，其中负责人（特朗普、他的律师鲁迪·朱利安尼和他的前幕僚长马克·梅多斯）有他们想要出售的东西（在这种情况下，选举谎言）。他们出去招募一支容易上当、雄心勃勃的销售队伍来传播信息（依靠律师西德尼·鲍威尔和詹娜·埃利斯等忠诚者），然后这些人又拉拢另一群销售者（州立法者、选举官员、州党官员和政府官员）。其他的）。走得足够远，你就会发现那些愿意充当假选举人的标记。最终，他们都与假冒产品联系在一起，这将损害他们的声誉，甚至可能损害他们的自由。<br><br>但我们不应该因为所谓的阴谋的愚蠢而分心。佐治亚州案件是了解特朗普的支持者和朝臣行动的一个重要窗口，这些前总统周围的平庸之人决心获得他们认为应得的尊重和地位，无论他们的实际才能如何。我们大多数人都像普通人一样过着普通的生活，做着普通的工作。并不是每一个职业都是令人满意的，正如我的工薪阶层父亲常说的那样，即使是好莱坞演员也可能在某些时候讨厌他们的工作，因为他们不得不从床上爬起来，坐在化妆椅上。用了几个小时。 （我对真实演员工作的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/05/succession-america-decides-tom-nichols/674060/">一次尝试</a>证实了这一明智的观察。）<br><br>然而，自从踏入政坛以来，特朗普一直扮演着这个充满怨恨的第三集团的守护神角色。例如，埃利斯的法律职业生涯始于科罗拉多州乡村司法管辖区的副检察官。正如<i>《</i><i>纽约时报》</i>在 2020 年<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/us/politics/jenna-ellis-trump.html">指出的</a>那样，她很快在电视上将自己推销为“宪法律师”，尽管缺乏经验“对她展现自己作为权威人物的能力没有明显影响”。与特朗普不同，这些人并不是传奇人物。事实上，他们最显着的特征是他们每个人都是多么渺小、多么奇怪和多么无能——然而，从起诉书来看，他们作为一个群体是多么危险。<br><br>在被告中，只有梅多斯和朱利安尼是全国性人物。 （鲍威尔之所以出名，主要是因为他在福克斯新闻上发表言论，兜售一些连福克斯管理层和主持人都认为<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/09/26/was-rudy-giuliani-always-so-awful">充分记录</a>。就梅多斯而言，他似乎只是另一位沉迷于首都生活的政客，他的朋友和敌人都<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/politics/jeffrey-clark-trump-election.html">，肩上有专业的筹码</a>。他也可能愿意成为对其同胞的威胁。根据史密斯的起诉书，当时任白宫副法律顾问帕特里克·菲尔宾（Patrick Philbin）警告“同谋 4”（似乎是克拉克）时，如果特朗普以某种方式在任期结束后继续执政，就会爆发骚乱，同谋 4 <a data-event-element="inline link"

（弗里曼和她的女儿兼选举同事沙耶·莫斯（Shaye Moss）成为特朗普及其打手小队的目标后， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/georgia-poll-workers-targeted-trump-cleared-false-election-fraud-claim-rcna90350">他们的生活发生了翻天覆地的变化</a>。）<br><br>威利斯还起诉了一群涉嫌参与用假选举人取代佐治亚州真实选举人的阴谋的人，其中包括佐治亚州共和党前主席和现任佐治亚州参议员。与此同时，两名女性（其中一名是县选举监督员）也因<a

href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/05/13/coffee-county-misty-hampton-election/">涉嫌违反</a>佐治亚州咖啡县的投票系统而受到指控。<br><br>所有这些人都被起诉，但没有被定罪。但很少有特朗普的捍卫者认为任何被告实际上都没有<i>做</i>他们被指控做的事情。相反，特朗普世界及其<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/georgia-prosecutor-showed-no-semblance-restraint-trump-says-turley-excessive-dangerous">相关媒体</a>似乎对这些行为是否构成<i>犯罪</i>存在争议。<i> </i>（在今天发布的一份声明中，特朗普的律师<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4153028-trump-attorneys-call-events-before-georgia-indictment-shocking/">表示</a>，佐治亚州的起诉书“无疑与整个程序一样有缺陷且违宪。”）<br><br>尽管如此，如果没有特朗普，这些人中的大多数人永远不会远离国家权力的杠杆。当特朗普输了，他们就输了。代表权力和影响力的铜环——也许最重要的是尊重——被从他们手中夺走了几英寸。他们现在都拥有了自己渴望的重要性，但可能并不像他们期望的那样。<br><br><b>有关的：</b><br><br><li>

eBay、Craigslist 和亚马逊上的瓶子售价高达<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/san-francisco-senor-sisig-sriracha-stolen-18156771.php">从当地餐馆偷酱汁</a>。<br><br>短缺的很大一部分原因可以归咎于汇丰脆弱的供应链。赋予酱汁柑橘甜味的红色墨西哥辣椒对温度很挑剔，通常是手工采摘的。很大一部分辣椒也生长在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/business/sriracha-shortage-huy-fong.html">墨西哥北部</a>特别干旱的地区，那里的许多田地都用<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-26/sriracha-shortage-climate-change-mexico-drought">水</a>灌溉，而科罗拉多河本身就是一种紧张且竞争激烈的资源。但专家告诉我，所有这一切都只是为最后的气候打击做好准备：近年来墨西哥<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150691/la-nina-times-three">遭受</a>了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/02/sriracha-hot-sauce-shortage-mexico-drought">严重的干旱</a>，水库的排水量如此之低，以至于连用于农业的水也基本上被封锁了。<br><br>拉差短缺并不是气候变化引发的最严重的农作物危机。多年来， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/dining/farming-climate-change.html">密歇根州的樱桃</a>一直在过高的温度下窒息，而<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/01/climate-crisis-us-food-system-five-crops">佛罗里达州的柑橘</a>则被飓风摧毁。印度的小麦作物被<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/india-india-extreme-temperatures-scorch-indian-wheat-production">烤焦</a>，而世界各地的水稻则受到<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/20/climate/rice-farming-climate-change.html">洪水和热浪</a>的双重打击。但现在看到辣椒处于危险之中是它自己的特殊烧伤。辣椒生长于世界上一些最温暖的地区，长期以来一直是耐热性的典范。与许多其他植物相比，它们应该没问题。不过现在，随着气温变得更加炎热，干旱继续席卷地球，“我认为我们会更频繁地看到这种情况，”墨西哥国立自治大学的气候科学家吉列尔莫·穆雷-托塔罗洛告诉我。是拉差的麻烦可能会成为未来更加无趣的时代的风向标。<br><br>目前，大多数辣椒作物<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/business/sriracha-shortage-huy-fong.html">仍长势良好</a>。加州大学戴维斯分校的胡椒育种专家艾伦·范·迪恩泽 (Allen Van Deynze) 告诉我，在经历了去年夏天残酷的热浪之后，作为西方世界胡椒种植热点之一的加利福尼亚州的几个地区现在迎来了丰收的一年。就连去年导致墨西哥红辣椒田被毁的干旱状况也已从最糟糕的情况有所改善。辣椒植物很难被压垮。 “除非你的夜晚温度高于 60 度，而白天温度为 80 或 85 度，否则他们会不高兴，”Van Deynze 说。默里-托塔罗洛告诉我，红墨西哥辣椒一直处于辣椒作物歉收的最前沿，因为它们是不寻常的<em>冬</em>辣椒，并且在比其他地方的同类辣椒略低的温度下生长得最好。但与其他一些夏季作物相比，即使是它们的理想状态也相当温和：例如，西红柿的生长温度比辣椒喜欢的温度低 10 度，Van Deynze 告诉我。<br><br>许多辣椒育种者实际上倾向于在作物温度范围的上限附近工作。新墨西哥州立大学的辣椒研究员斯蒂芬妮·沃克（Stephanie Walker）表示，辣椒素是一种让辣椒产生舌头刺痛感的化学物质，它是一种植物防御机制，而辣椒“在压力下会增强防御机制”。告诉我。 “我们对人们说，在经历了充满压力的生长年之后，‘我们将会有美味、辛辣、美味的辣椒’”从另一端出来。一些专家还认为，最好明智地对辣椒用水，尤其是在采摘前几周。南伊利诺伊大学的蔬菜科学家斯图尔特·艾伦·沃尔特斯告诉我，过多的灌溉会稀释水果的味道，因此一些农民会选择少量灌溉。<br><br>但超过一定阈值后，辣椒也会开始发出嘶嘶声。一旦温度达到约 90 至 95 度，传粉者就会停止造访；花朵开始死亡，但不会产生果实或种子。尽管少量的水配给可以缓解辣味，但辣椒——像任何其他生命形式一样——如果得不到足够的液体营养就会死亡。当降雨稀少时，维持许多辣椒种植园的灌溉可以起到缓冲作用，但在极端<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.drought.gov/watersheds/colorado">干旱</a>时期，这些水的配给最终也会受到限制。<br><br>辣椒也不能免受已经困扰其他作物的气候相关问题的影响。地球的逐渐变暖已经消除了冬季的许多寒流，这对于依靠寒冷来减少杂草、害虫及其传播的许多疾病数量的农民来说是一个问题。 “这一点非常清楚：我们看到病毒数量大幅增加，”范·迪恩泽告诉我。此外，热浪和干旱会使植物更容易受到花端腐病的影响，这种疾病会使果实的尖端变黑和死亡。沃克告诉我，由于炎热的天气几乎没有喘息的机会，工人们更频繁地发现自己在危险的条件下采摘辣椒。<br><br>对胡椒生产进行一些调整可能会有所帮助。种植者可以将北美的主要辣椒产区转移到更北的地方，以追求更温和的气温。研究人员还已经在努力培育更多耐旱和耐热的植物，以应对未来更加艰难的岁月。但没有任何保证。基因改造可能很慢，而且有时需要权衡：例如，当育种者选择气候适应能力时，他们必须非常小心，避免失去辛辣味，或改变辣椒的标志性风味，默里-托塔罗洛说。沃克告诉我，仍然存在“生理上限”，超过这个上限，即使是最精心培育的植物也无法生长或繁殖。沃克说，很难确切地说上限在哪里。但作为温暖爱好者中的佼佼者，辣椒可能已经比科学家们希望的更接近了。<br><br>辣椒不会很快从地球表面消失。但即使是少数品种的损失和短缺也会带来痛苦。新墨西哥州的哈奇青辣椒已经面临<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.11/south-agriculture-hatch-green-chiles-are-feeling-the-heat">干旱</a>的压力。默里-托塔罗洛对墨西哥一些特别稀有的辣椒品种的未来感到担忧：黑哈瓦那辣椒，一种产自尤卡坦半岛的花香泥土辣椒；

辣椒，生长在该国北部地区，为海鲜带来柑橘般的滋滋声。他告诉我，当地菜肴现在面临风险。那种独特、独特的味道是“你无法替代的”。<br><br>这就是胡椒产品的吸引力，也是它们最大的弱点。每一种都是对其食谱核心的辣椒品种的致敬，而真正的辣椒爱好者通常并不热衷于替代品。辣椒酱的发酵甜味与参巴辣酱的鲜味不相称；塔巴斯科不能像乔卢拉那样挠痒痒。即使<em>在是</em>拉差酱料类别中，汇丰的许多<a

“如果一个产地的供应量有限，通常会有另一个产地的可接受的替代品，”世界咖啡研究中心的农业生态学家克雷格·克拉夫特告诉我。然而，对于辣椒来说，失去唯一生长的超本地地区的作物可能会导致整个产品线陷入困境。<br><br>任何辣椒的衰落都会伴随着讽刺：这些植物进化出了一种惩罚性的辣味，这显然会给包括我们在内的各种生物带来痛苦；现在我们使世界变暖足以折磨他们。如果我们这个更热的星球最终变得不那么辣，那是因为热武器已经易手。<br><br></div>

Children]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>这部热门的澳大利亚动画片毫不犹豫地以孩子们可以理解、父母也会欣赏的方式探索复杂的情感。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/fF4dBPaId5B74oX7pCDUOPtxJwU=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/bluey/original.jpg" alt="电视剧《Bluey》中的场景" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>布鲁伊图片/迪士尼</figcaption></figure>上周，我向妻子提出了一个可能涉及我们许多朋友的问题：“你认为班迪特和辣椒还会再生一个孩子吗？”她想了想，然后摇了摇头。 “可能不会。他们把婴儿床扔了出去，还记得吗？”<br><br>当然。我妻子指的不是她在 Facebook Marketplace 上看到的列表，而是“卧室”，这是澳大利亚儿童节目<em>Bluey</em>第三季中的一集，她和我都看过至少十几次。考虑到我们和两岁的女儿一起一遍又一遍地观看<em>《Bluey》</em> ，我们对《Bluey》的熟悉程度可能比任何其他正在播出的节目都要丰富。但令我惊讶的并不是我们共同的知识，而是我们正在谈论一对卡通狗，就像它们是我们认识的人一样。<br><br>当你有一个年幼的孩子时，你会被动地观看大量儿童电视节目，而我这个沉迷于屏幕的自己会情不自禁地关注它如何提供温和的生活课程或充满活力的情感冲动。但甚至在我女儿出生之前，家长朋友就经常称<em>《Bluey》</em>为儿童节目，比其他节目更胜一筹。三个多季以来，该剧因有关拟人化澳大利亚狗家庭 Heelers 的深思熟虑<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/12/still-the-best-television-series-in-the-world-bluey-is-back-disney-plus">、</a>有趣的冒险故事而<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/08/bluey-disney-plus-parents.html">广受</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/05/bluey-best-kids-tv-show.html">赞誉</a>：爸爸 Bandit、妈妈 Chilli 以及他们的女儿 Bluey（6 岁）和 Bingo（4 岁）。它的许多剧集证实了该剧故事讲述的令人印象深刻的深度，以一种儿童节目真正不需要为成人做的方式奖励我的深入审查。<br><br>大多数剧集（每集大约七分钟）都集中在布鲁伊正在玩的游戏上，通常是与她的家人或她的一些学校朋友一起玩，他们住在一个类似布里斯班的城市，那里居住着各种可以想象的品种的双足会说话的狗。该节目颂扬富有想象力的游戏和 Bluey 的无限活力，因为她的父母尽最大努力跟上她奇特的即兴创作（尤其是 Bandit，他无穷无尽的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/blueys-dad-thinks-hes-so-great">随心所欲</a>的能力让大多数父母感到羞愧）。但游戏并不是一切——角色的描绘足够丰富，以至于我开始认为父母们正在经历和我一样的痛苦。<br><br>在第三季（也是最新一季）的一集《牧羊犬》中，明显劳累过度的辣椒在准备晚餐后，向强盗提出了一个任何家长都可能认识的请求。 “我需要 20 分钟没人靠近我，”她严厉地说，他毫不犹豫地承认了这一点。这个要求让布鲁伊感到困惑，她在这一集中的剩余时间里试图问她的母亲她做错了什么。当然，我们的教训是，一切都没有错——有时成年人只<em>需要 20 分钟</em>。但这是一个比大多数儿童电视敢于尝试的更微妙的前提来构建一集。像<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/07/the-daniel-tiger-doctrine/565187/"><em>《丹尼尔·泰格》</em></a>这样的节目虽然很有帮助，但并没有试图解释父母在日常生活中短暂的疲倦感。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/12/rob-delaney-a-heart-that-works-book-excerpt/672566/">阅读：帮助我垂死的儿子沟通的电视节目</a><br><br>这就是<em>《Bluey》</em>的大胆之处，该剧主要由其创作者乔·布鲁姆 (Joe Brumm) 撰写：它相信年轻观众也能够理解有关父母的缺点和不安全感的故事。第二季的一集名为“爷爷”，讲述了布鲁伊和宾果与脾气暴躁的爷爷一起在澳大利亚丛林中奔跑的故事，同时也讲述了辣椒对父亲年事已高的焦虑，以及他不想放慢脚步的固执。精彩的《粘壁虎》是巴斯特·基顿式的小闹剧，辣椒在努力让她的孩子们出去玩耍时。但它也有一个让我措手不及的随意时刻，正如奇利回忆的那样，当布鲁伊出生时，他们即将去看望的孩子们的母亲给她做了五份烤宽面条。 “这对我来说意义重大！”她感叹道，表达了意外得到一位亲密朋友的照顾所带来的深深的甜蜜，这种感觉是我作为新手父母所珍惜的。<br><br>情感的特异性与肢体幽默的精确度和世界建筑的密度同样重要。 <em>Bluey</em>是地球上任何地方的幼儿都能理解的生动表演，但它也是当代育儿的特殊代表。它是从孩子的角度讲述的，超现实魔法的闪光可以渗透到布鲁伊的现实中，但它也总是非常现实地把任何家庭车辆的后座描绘成完全<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/kateyrich/status/1550106088300740612?lang=en">散落着垃圾</a>。<br><br>上个月在美国播出的最新剧集强调了该剧在构建海勒家族之外的宇宙方面也取得了巨大成功，采用了不同的叙事惯例，并突出了更广泛的群体中的角色。 “故事”这一集重点讲述了布鲁伊在学校的同学以及他们在手工项目中遇到的挫折； 《连体衣》由罗丝·拜恩客串出演，介绍了辣椒的妹妹布兰迪，并间接但有力地探讨了她因无法生育而与家庭的疏远。<br><br>这些叙事转向不一定适合七分钟儿童节目的公式，其中首要任务始终是吸引孩子的注意力（这不是一件容易的事）。<em>布鲁伊</em>做到了这一点，却没有感到自命不凡或粗暴，这简直令人震惊。一系列新剧集已经在澳大利亚播出，虽然我的孩子对我们能看到的大约 140 集感到非常满意，但我已经等不及更多了——不仅仅是为了多样性，也是为了看看电视上最精彩的剧集在哪里。接下来将推出出乎意料的雄心勃勃的节目。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 15:34:48 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-rejects-trump-effort-to-move-new-york-criminal-case-to-federal-court/">因为它在 7 月份的纽约没有起作用</a>，但一旦发生，有两件事是肯定的：它会引起我们的注意，并且会带来拖延的可能性——这是特朗普最喜欢的策略。联邦法律规定，如果州法院开始的起诉涉及“美国任何官员”“以该职位名义”采取的“任何行为”，则可以在 30 天内<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1442#a">“移交”联邦法院</a>。<br><br>根据最高法院长期以来的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/489/121/">判例</a>，这一要求意味着该行为必须涉及该官员的工作表现，并且该官员必须针对刑事指控提出“有色彩的联邦辩护”。从本质上讲，这两个因素将融合在特朗普声称一直代表美国行事、试图改变格鲁吉亚选举结果的声明中。他将辩称，他只是在履行总统的职责，确保佐治亚州依法进行计票。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-georgia-indictment-election/675018/">大卫·A·格雷厄姆：佐治亚州的起诉书提供了全貌</a><br><br>特朗普冒充选举进程的联邦保护者确实很讽刺。特朗普根据驱逐法向联邦法院寻求庇护的历史讽刺也是如此。<br><br>今天的驱逐法规可以追溯到内战前夕。国会颁布了一项前身法规，以<a

href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanbar.org%2Fgroups%2Fgpsolo%2Fpublications%2Fgpsolo_ereport%2F2022%2Fapril-2022%2Fto-remove-or-not-remove-look-federal-officer-removal-statute%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cltribe%40kaplanhecker.com%7Cb984774f1acc4577200408db1d85398f%7C1e4b3f30f28846caa093d033aa3a7c4a%7C0%7C0%7C638136230315641533%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=QFo5eQ27F2z5RRy5bMkmCm1W8AgQq3uK%2FbrsIsSncSM%3D&amp;reserved=0">保护</a>联邦法律的实施，防止南方各州试图通过逮捕和起诉履行其职能的人来破坏联邦。然而现在，特朗普将援引该法规来保护自己免受州起诉，州起诉试图追究他对宪法造成的损害的责任，侵犯了各州选择自己总统选举人的权利和义务。<br><br>特朗普永远不会被讽刺所吓倒，他可能会走这条路，无论其成功的前景如何有限，因为如果案件转移到联邦法院，它可能会减慢进展速度，而这是他的诉讼首选。每失去一周，我们就会危险地距离下一次总统选举更近。<br><br>但如果他成功的话，他将有机会参加由整个佐治亚州北区组成的陪审团，而不仅仅是来自位于紫蓝色亚特兰大的富尔顿县。陪审团成员包括富尔顿的八个邻近县，其中包括<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Victorshi2020/status/1600283454007955456">该州最红的</a>县之一，这很可能是特朗普的目标，因为他相信陪审团很可能包括无论证据如何都倾向于无罪释放的“永远的特朗普”信徒。<br><br>此外，特朗普可能会任命一位友好的法官来主持审判——从特朗普的角度来看，理想的情况是，他任命自己为佐治亚州北区法官的四名法官之一。此外，他的律师肯定会看到迫使州检察官在一个不熟悉的联邦论坛上进行诉讼可能带来的策略上的好处。<br><br>威利斯可能会出于特朗普采取这一举措的所有原因而反对这一举措。好消息是，她预期的将案件退回州法院的动议最终会获得通过。<br><br>富尔顿县的起诉书指控特朗普以多种方式刑事干预佐治亚州总统选举人的选举。其中最主要的是他在 2021 年 1 月 2 日给佐治亚州国务卿布拉德·拉芬斯伯格 (Brad Raffensperger) 打电话时录制的臭名昭著的录音。在那次电话中，特朗普向拉芬斯佩格<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/us/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia.html">施压</a>，要求他“找到 11,780 张选票”——这超出了推翻总统乔·拜登获得佐治亚州 16 张选举人票所需的数量。特朗普甚至错误地暗示，如果拉芬斯佩格没有“找到”这些选票，他可能会面临刑事指控。<br><br>然后就是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/fake-electors-explained-trump-jan-6.html">假选举人计划</a>。特朗普的 2020 年竞选活动在佐治亚州以及其他六个州进行了竞选活动，目的是在 2021 年 1 月 6 日制造一场虚假的争端，这将导致国会拒绝或推迟对拜登当选的认证。<br><br>这两种形式的干预表明了可能的“罢免”动议的一个主要障碍：无论是他给拉芬斯佩格的电话，还是通过煽动毫无根据的选举人名争夺来阻碍国会会议的阴谋，都不在他作为总统的职权范围之内。 。特朗普显然意识到需要表现出相反的态度，他已经在社交媒体上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://truthsocial.com/users/realDonaldTrump/statuses/109876091900766566">植入了</a>这样的想法，即他的总统职责“确保法律得到忠实执行”包括确保所有 50 个州的安全、可靠和公平的选举。<br><br>即使我们接受特朗普确实担心佐治亚州选举结果公平性的观点，他的主张也存在问题：总统在确保选举中遵守法治方面可以发挥的任何作用背景聚焦于 2020 年 11 月 3 日在佐治亚州进行的选票竞选，其中包括一名美国参议员、14 名美国众议员和一批全州公职人员的选举。但是，宪法和实施宪法的法律刻意赋予美国总统绝对不具有监督作用的唯一一次选举是由选举人团负责的。<br><br>事实上，我们的宪法选举总统的程序明显将现任总统本人排除在外。选举团制度是指各州的总统选举人名单在州议会大厦得到正式认证，并发送给华盛顿，然后由副总统在华盛顿揭幕，并在 1 月 6 日的特别会议上在众议院和参议院进行计票。联席会议。唐纳德·特朗普承诺在该<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/01/trump-capitol-riot-march/">会议</a>上加入他的支持者的行列具有新闻价值，因为它威胁使用暴力，而且因为它违背了宪法明显将总统排除在国会程序之外的规定。<br><br> <a

href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/23/jan6-doj-clark-rosen-donoghue-testimony/">努力</a>中，特朗普甚至没有声称他正在努力确保任何这些下一轮选举的安全、保障或公平。他唯一关注的是自己在 2020 年 12 月 14 日在亚特兰大举行的选举团投票中落败。<br><br> Certainly no concept of a president&#39;s duties includes threatening a state election official in order to flip the count in the president&#39;s favor <i>in his own election</i> or getting state officials to replace the actual electoral slate with a fake one. As a federal court in Washington, DC, ruled in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/politics/judge-ruling-trump-civil-lawsuit-january-6/index.html"><i>Thompson v. Trump</i></a> , “No constitutional provision or federal statute … grants … the President … any power or duty with respect to the Certification of the Electoral College vote.”<br><br> Trump&#39;s quest for removal also fails for a second, independent reason: He cannot offer a “colorable” federal-law defense to the charges against him. While a “colorable” defense is one that is merely <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/colorable_claim#:~:text=A%20colorable%20claim%20is%20a,actually%20result%20in%20a%20win.">plausible</a> , as opposed to one that&#39;s likely to succeed, the nature of Trump&#39;s undisputed conduct makes any possible federal-law defense he might contemplate implausible in the extreme.<br><br> The primary defense that Trump is virtually certain to present is presidential immunity—the idea that he is entitled to absolute protection from legal consequences for actions taken while he was president. But as the Supreme Court held in 1982, the claim to such immunity even in civil suits for damages—leaving open whether there is any such immunity at all in a criminal case—extends <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/457/731/#tab-opinion-1954625">no further than</a> the “outer perimeter” of his duties of office and the performance of “particular functions of his office.” Policing the selection of a state&#39;s presidential electors in his own effort to remain in office cannot plausibly be among them.<br><br> In addition to asserting immunity, Trump might argue that he was exercising his First Amendment rights in his call to Raffensperger and even in his role in the fake-elector scheme. Any such argument would be legal nonsense. It would amount to claiming that laws criminalizing conduct using words to solicit fraud or theft impermissibly abridge the freedom of speech. Settled law (and common sense) is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/333/178/">to the contrary</a> .<br><br> Three decades ago the Supreme Court <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/489/121/">laid out</a> the requirements for a federal officer to remove a prosecution from state to federal court. In doing so, the Court relied on a “strong judicial policy” against imposing “extraordinary burdens on the States.” The Court there explicitly recognized that the removal of state cases to federal court carries just such burdens.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/january-6-indictment-trump-first-amendment/675012/">Alan Z. Rozenshtein: The First Amendment is no defense for Trump&#39;s alleged crimes</a><br><br> No case in recent memory exemplifies that concern more clearly than this one. The states carry the principal responsibility for the fair and honest selection of presidential electors, and their authority to hold accountable those who commit crimes to frustrate that outcome is a matter of the highest priority.<br><br> District Attorney Fani Willis&#39;s determination to deliver on her responsibility to the rule of law exemplifies a civil servant doing her duty without fear or favor. What Trump did is unprecedented, and it thus calls for the vigorous response of a state prosecutor to enforce the law against a former president.<br><br> Trump&#39;s bogus claims to have been doing his job in trying to overturn the election and otherwise being immune simply because he was president at the time should be roundly rejected, and his effort to remove the case to federal court denied. It is but the latest chapter in his unending assault on the rule of law by trying to keep it from applying to himself as it does to all of us.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 15:34:33 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-georgia-indictment-motion-remove/675019/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-georgia-indictment-motion-remove/675019/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Afghanistan Changed Me]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> I thought that being a war correspondent was the pinnacle of my profession as a journalist.

Dubai International Airport was one of the glitziest in the world—enormous and modern and filled with luxury shops and lounges. But that was only Terminals 1 and 3.<br><br> Terminal 2 was for the discount carriers flying to South and Central Asia and parts of Africa—places like Uzbekistan, Somalia, Iraq, and Afghanistan. The passengers were generally poor construction workers, mercenaries, contractors, and journalists like me.<br><br> I was a public-radio correspondent and had produced stories about Afghanistan for years, but I had been longing to report from the field. When I finally had the chance, I dove in. Only later would I realize how oblivious I had been to the true human costs of the conflicts I had sought to cover.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/08/us-withdrawal-afghanistan-strategy-shortcomings/670980/">Read: Afghanistan did not have to turn out this way</a><br><br> That first trip, I was reporting on the Taliban&#39;s use of Pakistani tribal regions as a training ground. It was clear that if the Taliban had a sanctuary the US couldn&#39;t touch (at least not with ground forces), the war was doomed. I had been granted an embed in Laghman, a province in northeast Afghanistan where the Taliban had supply lines to Pakistan.<br><br> I landed in Kabul and hauled my gear into the dusty winter air. Kabul looked like a cross between Russia and Sudan: The gray sky and scattered trees were Moscow, and the rundown buildings and hordes of vendors were Khartoum. A driver took me north, past mud houses seemingly stacked on top of one another up the hills. Kabul was full of people who had fled the provinces over the years to escape conflict. Many didn&#39;t want to, or couldn&#39;t, return to their homes, and so they stayed, crowded into informal settlements.<br><br> I arrived at Bagram, then flew to Camp Fenty. As I waited there for transportation to Laghman, I spoke with the brigade commander, who told me in no uncertain terms that security was getting worse, there was no chance of locking down the border, and if Pakistan provided haven, the Taliban would be difficult to beat.<br><br> I had hoped to head out on combat patrols in Laghman, but instead I was assigned to travel around with one of the US government&#39;s provincial reconstruction teams. At least it allowed me to speak with Afghans about their experiences. Road construction was one of America&#39;s major initiatives, counterinsurgency 101. The theory was that with paved roads came increased economic development. Greater economic opportunity would mean less likelihood of people accepting payments from insurgents to shoot at coalition forces or to blow things up.<br><br> Afghans posed for pictures with me looking like a dork in my frumpy body armor and thick-rimmed ballistic goggles. They expressed gratitude to the United States and frustration with Pakistan. But I often wondered what they might be thinking that they did not say.<br><br> I spent a few days at an outpost in Najil. Soldiers told me that militants would frequently sneak up the opposing ridge and fire on the base. One evening, they believed an attack was imminent and fired off three rounds in the direction of the suspected threat. However, one of the rounds was an illuminating mortar—a potentially catastrophic mistake, because it hovered there, shining over the entire valley, turning the base into a well-lit target.<br><br> We waited, and waited, and yet nothing happened. The night was cold and rainy, and the soldiers explained that the militants who typically attacked were “fair-weather” fighters—locals paid a few bucks by the Taliban to take shots at the base. The chilly rain was enough to stop them. Although there was no contact that night, something that should always have been obvious to me was beginning, for the first time, to feel real: I was in a war zone, and even if I was surrounded by the best troops and military hardware in the world, I was not safe.<br><br> I returned to Afghanistan in October 2009, this time to report on security conditions and development efforts. I traveled to Gardez, in the east, and was embedded with American troops building and inspecting schools. I followed along with an Army captain and engineer, a tall man with wire-framed glasses and a mustache. We walked through a shoddily built school, where bricks, mortar, and other debris were scattered all over the floor. The captain made muted sounds of frustration, but no workers were around to be reprimanded. A couple of weeks before, locals had found an IED planted in the school.<br><br> That night I had anxiety dreams. I wasn&#39;t sure what to make of them. I hadn&#39;t experienced anything dangerous, but I was starting to tune in to the general stress level of being in a place where something could go <i>boom</i> at any moment.<br><br> The next morning, I caught a flight to Combat Outpost Herrera, a small base atop a hill about 10 miles from the Pakistani border. It was the ideal place to observe how the border was nothing but a line on the map to insurgents. The base had seen a fair amount of action. Insurgents had been coming close enough to the base to attack with small arms.<br><br> Sure enough, soon after I arrived, an explosion occurred nearby. The alarm went off, and I scrambled for the bunker along with a few civil-affairs soldiers. The security forces ran to their posts around the perimeter. After a few minutes of huddling in the cramped space, we got the all clear. A mortar had landed outside the base, but it didn&#39;t trigger a firefight. At the time, I felt mostly excited that I might finally gain an understanding of the realities of combat.<br><br> That evening, the troops had a cookout. They were loose and having fun squirting gasoline on the coals in the oil-drum grills to stoke the fires. Most of them were just kids, many not even old enough to drink. They had been barely 10 or 11 years old when 9/11 had happened.<br><br> When I was their age, I was going to fraternity parties, playing guitar, chasing girls, and in general being a class clown. I couldn&#39;t imagine how that version of me would have handled heading off to a foreign land to fight an unfamiliar enemy.<br><br> At one point, as I was hanging out with a couple of soldiers in the small, plywood rec room, there was a slight boom and rumble—like someone stomping on the roof. We looked at one another and pondered whether we needed to react. Then the alert came over the base PA system. Off to the bunkers we went. According to soldiers, the explosion had happened about 500 yards from the base—perhaps someone had stepped on an old mine or bungled the planting of an IED, but most likely it was a poorly aimed mortar or rocket.<br><br> A couple of days later I flew to Salerno in Khost province. Like most larger bases, Salerno had a bazaar. It consisted of a couple dozen metal containers that had been converted into shops where Afghans sold rugs, local crafts, and bootlegged DVDs.<br><br> I joined a group of soldiers for tea outside one of the shops. The shop owner, Saeed, a slight man in his late 20s, said that he faced threats for working with the Americans, but no other job paid him enough to support his family. He was frustrated by the corruption of the Afghan government, and he felt that security was getting worse. Just then we heard a loud <i>boom</i> , followed by a quick whistling sound. I caught the second impact out of the corner of my eye. A black cloud of smoke rose from behind a building about 75 yards away.<br><br> Some two dozen people scrambled to the bunker in the center of the bazaar. Nothing had ever landed that close before, people were saying. I spoke with a few of the Afghan shopkeepers. They all said it was the most frightening moment of their time at the base.<br><br> When I walked to the scene, I realized how lucky everyone in the area had been. A tree had broken the fall of the shell. The projectile hit the branches, detonated, and then sprayed a comet tail of shrapnel all over the area. A canvas tent sat about 20 feet from the tree. Seven soldiers had been sitting inside at the time of the impact. Chunks of shrapnel sliced the tent and cut through the interior plywood like it was wet bread.<br><br> I walked through the tent. There were holes everywhere—in the ceiling and floor, in chairs, lights, computer monitors. The soldiers&#39; body armor had been perched on stands in the tent, and several of the vests had been torn by the flying chunks of metal.<br><br> Amazingly, shrapnel hit only one of the seven soldiers. And the injury was so mild that he didn&#39;t even notice it until a few moments after the blast. He walked off to the medical tent under his own power to have the metal removed. Surrounding buildings had several-inch-deep impact craters in their brick and cement walls. The blast had had more than enough force to kill everyone in the tent, and yet it had caused only one small flesh wound.<br><br> Had the tree not been there, the rocket would have landed in the tent and probably killed everyone. If you want any proof that war is a game of inches, well, that was it.<br><br> That night, I again struggled to sleep. The blast replayed in my head. I had to process that anything could happen at any moment. I was on a mission to see and experience war for what it was, but I also wanted to go home in one piece.<br><br> The next day, another close call: While we were on a mission to a village to inspect another construction project, an explosion rang out. An Afghan on a motorcycle had hit the trip wire for an IED that had been planted in the road into the village. The motorcyclist survived the blast, but the IED was not meant for him. It was meant for us—and it had been planted there in the short time that we were in the village.<br><br> The implications were disconcerting. It was possible that on our way into the village we had passed some bad guys who saw an opportunity to plant the IED. It was also possible that someone in the village had tipped off bad guys. Either way, it meant insurgents were camped out in the area and possibly mixed in with the local population. Maybe one of the men the soldiers had just paid for working on the construction site had called about planting the IED. That was the war in a nutshell.<br><br> Had the motorcyclist not hit the IED, our convoy would have. We looked at the blast crater as we drove out of the village.<br><br> I think a lot of journalists, myself included, started out with a false sense of security during embeds. Subconsciously, it could feel like a TV war sometimes—like there was no real danger. However, that bubble had been definitively pierced for me. I knew how naive I had been. And that made me question what it was that I had been seeking in the first place.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/03/biden-afghanistan-exit-american-allies-abandoned/621307/">From the March 2022 issue: The betrayal</a><br><br> That day was the first time I started to think deeply about what I was doing and why I was doing it. Was I chasing firefights because I felt it was crucial to cover and report on them? Or because I had something to prove, because I wanted people to think I was brave? I started to realize it might have been more the latter. Some of it had to do with notions of masculinity, the idea that real men did combat journalism. I realized I had been ignoring the human toll all around me.<br><br> I was wrong to have believed that experiencing combat was the pinnacle of war reporting. As I gained more experience, I began to see how reports from journalists with that attitude tended to be more about how badass they were for being in the thick of the action than about the people who were fighting, suffering, and dying. Many journalists were narcissistic and ambitious. Some were damaged.<br><br> From 2012 to 2014, I reported full-time from Kabul—I was NPR&#39;s last correspondent to be based there. In those years, I reported on the deaths of numerous friends and colleagues as the Taliban began targeting foreign civilians.<br><br> The last year, I was part of a group embed in Helmand when I overheard an American correspondent say, “I&#39;m only happy when I&#39;m being shot at.” In 2009, I might have felt the same, or at least empathized. In 2014, after years of covering conflict, it struck me as about the most defective thing I had heard in a war zone.<br><br> Back in DC, I had difficulty readjusting. One morning, a car bomb went off outside my condo—or at least, that&#39;s what it sounded and felt like. I shot up out of bed and stood pulsing with adrenaline. I looked outside the window and saw no smoke or debris. What I did see were storm clouds gathering. What I thought had been a car bomb was an epic clap of thunder. It took me at least an hour to calm down.<br><br> I knew that I had been altered by years of covering death, destruction, and devastation, but I had no idea how damaged I was. I had no reentry care or support. I felt isolated and had difficulty interacting with friends and family. I made a series of bad life choices. I hit bottom and found the will to keep living ultimately because of my obligation to Squeak. She was a cat I rescued from the streets of Kabul shortly after moving there. I took pity on the dusty little kitten, and she became my battle buddy. Little did I know then that the decision to save her would, years later, save me.<br><br> Two years after the fall of Kabul, I am still processing. I believe it will be years, at least, before we as a country can understand the consequences of the 20 years of war that followed 9/11. And it will take at least as long for me to understand all of the ways I was changed by a doomed war that I felt was likely to fail from the time I first set foot in Afghanistan.<br><br> My experience has brought clarity about one thing: the need to support civilians who work in war zones. Though there is growing support for veterans&#39; mental health, the same cannot be said for the thousands of civilians—journalists, aid workers, diplomats, and others—who also risked their lives to help the people of Afghanistan. Many of them are dealing with the trauma of witnessing combat and its impact, but also with the painful reality that their work made little lasting difference—that the Afghan people are largely back to where they were before 9/11. Among the many lessons we ought to learn from America&#39;s failures in Afghanistan is one we can do something about now: Take better care of one another.<br><br> This essay was adapted from the book

class="smallcaps">在超过</span>四分之一个世纪的时间里，彭斯一直是一位尽职尽责、坚定的保守派。他开始在谈话电台工作，他的品牌是“脱咖啡因的拉什·林堡”。在他的第三次尝试中，他成功当选为众议院议员，他很高兴地在乔治·W·布什的两项重大立法成就——“不让一个孩子掉队”和扩大医疗保险——上反对共和党，以对抗共和党——彭斯都是在这两项成就上取得成功的。相信违反了他对某些小政府保守原则的承诺。但共和党人原谅了这些异端邪说。彭斯在众议院共和党领导层中升至第三位。<br><br>彭斯从众议院跃升至印第安纳州州长官邸，最后作为特朗普的竞选搭档获得了总统门票。你知道那是怎么回事：四年来，彭斯为特朗普的言行辩护。在幕后，他试图成为房间里的成年人。在国家电视台上，一只苍蝇停在他脸上。呀呀呀呀呀，然后政变来了。<br><br>此时，特朗普指示数千名支持者“强力”向美国国会大厦游行，阻止彭斯履行宪法规定的统计和核证选举人票的义务——这将使拜登正式成为当选总统。因此，一群最近投票选举彭斯为副总统的非常优秀的人走上宪法大道，架起绞刑架，冲进国会大厦。在这些活动过程中，许多人高呼“绞死迈克·彭斯”。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">就彭斯而言，</span>他对这种不愉快的情况持乐观态度。上个月，当被问及特朗普的最新威胁时——如果他被判有罪，美国将“非常危险”——他否认了这种可能性。彭斯对美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 的达纳·巴什 (Dana Bash) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/07/23/mike-pence-reacts-to-donald-trump-very-dangerous-sot-bash-sotu-vpx.cnn">表示</a>：“我们运动中的每个人都是热爱这个国家的美国人，都是爱国人士或奉行法律与秩序的人，他们永远不会在那里或其他任何地方做出这样的事情。”<br><br> Bash 的发言很简短。 “考虑到 1 月 6 日他们想绞死你，你竟然不关心这件事，这真是太了不起了，”她说。<br><br>彭斯回应道：“这场运动中的人们，那些在 2016 年和 2020 年团结起来支持我们事业的人们，是这个国家最敬畏上帝、最守法、最爱国的人民，我……不会容忍这种行为。”概括性的，因为它们没有事实依据。”<br><br>在美国政治中，从来没有哪个候选人如此尽职尽责地遵循耶稣的指示：“谁打你的脸，连另一个打你的脸。”因此，无论你对迈克·彭斯有什么想说的，我敢打赌，如果一群 MAGA Proud Boys 想要他的束腰外衣，他也会向他们提供他的斗篷。上帝保佑他。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">在其他方面，</span>彭斯让我想起《旧约》中的一位先知，他告诉以色列人他们不想听到的消息，但无论如何都坚持了下来，受到他试图拯救的人们的辱骂。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/gods-plan-for-mike-pence/546569/">2018 年 1 月/2 月号：上帝对迈克·彭斯的计划</a><br><br>几周前，彭斯参加了由家庭领袖赞助的爱荷华州市政厅活动。这是一次福音派前锋聚会，参加者是中西部保守派基督徒，自从彭斯穿短裤以来，他们就一直是彭斯的支持者。该活动的主持人塔克·卡尔森 (Tucker Carlson) 猛烈<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?529323-4/mike-pence-speaks-2023-family-leadership-summit">抨击</a>彭斯拒绝推翻 2020 年大选，并强硬支持对乌克兰的军事援助。彭斯勇敢地面对卡尔森，并坚持他的保守派信念。<br><br>因此，考虑到<a data-event-element="inline

href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/business/media/tucker-carlson-trump.html">在私下</a>谈论他如何“强烈”讨厌特朗普的电视节目主持人和特朗普自己的副总统之间的选择——后者在一代人的时间里尽职尽责地为政府中的保守派事业服务，除了推翻特朗普之外，他在<em>一切事情</em>上都支持特朗普。美国民主、福音派……为塔克欢呼，向彭斯发出嘘声。<br><br>请赐给我们巴拉巴。<br><br>美国<span class="smallcaps">其他</span>国家不太知道如何对待彭斯。他是一个复杂的人物。<br><br>一方面，他容忍并捍卫了特朗普时代的所有掠夺行为。 2016年，他在福音派选民中为特朗普担保，巩固了特朗普对该党的掌控。在弗吉尼亚州夏洛茨维尔之后，他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/16/mike-pence-supports-trump-charlottesville-241708">支持</a>特朗普。在第一次弹劾期间，他是特朗普的支柱。他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/good-cop-bad-cop-trump-pence-dynamic-coronavirus/story?id=70043623">试图</a>清理特朗普对新冠疫情处理不当的最糟糕部分，同时煞费苦心地赞扬特朗普所做的英勇工作。他是2020年忠实的竞选搭档，这一切都是他睁着眼睛做的。<br><br>另一方面，在特朗普试图阻挠权力和平过渡的时刻，彭斯是唯一站在宪法与崩溃之间的人。在经历了一段时间的懦弱之后，他在最重要的时刻表现出了勇气。如果他在 1 月 6 日没有遵守法律，不知道会发生什么。<br><br>一些人认为，彭斯不应仅仅因为<em>没有违法而</em>获得赞扬。我同情。今天早上我没有抢劫银行——我能得到一块饼干吗？但最终，我发现彭斯在履行职责时表现出的英雄气概令人无法忽视。 1 月 6 日，他面临身体和职业风险；他的事业、他的生活以及他的家人的生命都受到了威胁。他冒着一切风险去遵守法律。很高兴想到我们都会做同样的事情，但我不确定。我<em>确信</em>彭斯的绝大多数共和党同僚不会这么做。<br><br>此外，彭斯是仅有的三名一直直言不讳地谈论 1 月 6 日和法治的共和党总统候选人之一，他并没有将自己对特朗普的批评表述为仅仅是“不利于共和党获胜的机会”。彭斯具备民主运动所希望的共和党人的大部分特质。在某些方面，他是<em>小</em>民主意义上的一个例子，说明了一个旨在恢复健康和自由主义的共和党应该是什么样子。<br><br>也正是因为如此，彭斯才被那么多共和党人谩骂，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3872">好感度勉强持平</a>。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">事实证明</span>，彭斯也不太知道自己该怎么办。因此，他正在尝试成为那些想绞死他的选民的化身。<br><br>这是最该死的事情。彭斯克服了一生的政治部落主义，与他的团队决裂。现在他正试图报复——因为他看不到他帮助他们变成了什么样子。<br><br>我最喜欢的理论之一是，在特朗普执政期间，我们发现我们的政治光谱有两个轴。我们都熟悉左-右、进步-保守的 x 轴。但也有一个从上到下、自由主义到非自由主义的 Y 轴。这种情况在美国已经存在了很长一段时间——实际上是自建国以来——但随着种族隔离制度的结束，我们很多人都忘记了这条 y 轴的存在。我们假设 x 轴右侧的保守派——里根家族、布什家族、多尔家族、麦凯恩家族、罗姆尼家族——也都位于 y 轴的顶部（自由主义一端） 。因为他们是。<br><br>但随着特朗普的出现，一些人——包括选民和民选官员——开始沿着 Y 轴向下飘向非自由主义一边。<br><br>彭斯很乐意配合，直到筹码落下，此时他选择了自由主义和民主。为此，美国欠他一笔永远无法偿还的债。<br><br>彭斯的悲剧在于，尽管他在 x 轴上持有保守主义政策观点，但他对 y 轴上的自由主义的坚定信念现在对他要求投票给他的保守派来说最重要。<br><br>自由社会可以对税率、基础设施支出和外交政策产生争论。在一个不自由的社会中，这些问题都不重要——唯一重要的是谁掌握权力。 “谁，谁？”正如列宁主义者过去所说的那样。<br><br>在民主、宪法、法治等重大问题上，迈克·彭斯现在在 Y 轴上与乔·拜登的距离比与共和党选民的距离要近得多。<br><br>他要么看不到，要么不会。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

20%。<br><br>事实上，许多人似乎最终选择了南方，因为他们的目标是加州的完美气候，但很快意识到他们负担不起，并定居在一个同样温暖、更便宜的地方，比如菲尼克斯或奥斯汀。只要问问<a data-event-element="inline link"

Glaeser 表示：“没有任何变量比 1 月份的气温更能预测过去 120 年大都市区的增长。” “每个人都喜欢在冬天打高尔夫球，”加州大学伯克利分校的经济学家恩里科·莫雷蒂说。 “人们真的不喜欢寒冷的冬天，”布鲁金斯学会高级研究员珍妮·舒茨说。人们可能并不总是承认这一点，但他们似乎喜欢温暖的天气。<br><br>温暖的冬天似乎促进了廉价住房和充足的就业机会。人们会模糊地考虑一个有很多新企业和价值

“房地产开发商、房地产经纪人，他们不谈论夏天。他们谈论一月、二月和三月。”<br><br><b>太阳带的转折点？</b><br><br>也就是说，如果他们的城市继续供暖并且也超出了负担能力的范围，那么所有这些新的亚利桑那州人和德克萨斯人可能会离开。例如，已经有大批人离开<a data-event-element="inline link"

运动大会迅速而残酷地被摧毁。在几个小时内，五所成员大学出发参加竞争对手的会议，提供由电视体育合同资助的巨额发薪日。正如杰梅勒·希尔（Jemele Hill）在<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/college-football-greed-conference-alignment/674930/">所说的那样</a>，这种转变“使学校和会议的长期利益与他们自己永不满足的贪婪发生了冲突”。<br><br>体育爱好者习惯于看到他们最喜欢的球队把钱放在球迷的愿望之上。这让人很容易忘记，这不是一个关于职业体育特许经营权的故事，或者实际上，任何类型的私人实体的故事。所有五所叛逃学校都是公立大学：华盛顿州、俄勒冈州、犹他州、亚利桑那州和亚利桑那州立大学。大学橄榄球赛的抢钱行为只是美国公立高等教育面临的令人不安的压力的一个症状。事实证明，我们的许多公立大学的行为根本不像公共机构。<br><br>人们很自然地认为公立高等教育机构比私立高等教育机构更加平等。在 K-12 中，公立学校免费，而私立学校则昂贵。但在大学层面，公民目的和私人利润之间的界限并没有那么清晰地映射到公共/私人鸿沟上。 The clearest evidence to date comes from a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">blockbuster study</a> by a trio of economists at Harvard&#39;s Opportunity Insights project. Most media coverage has focused on the study&#39;s analysis of the so-called Ivy Plus schools, where the researchers found that the wealthiest students get an admissions bump relative to other applicants with the same academic profile. Even among people with identical SAT scores, students from the top 0.1 percent of income are more than twice as likely to get into universities like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Public flagships such as UC Berkeley and the University of Virginia showed no such bias.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/public-universities-debt/619546/">Josh Mitchell: A crimson tide of debt</a><br><br> But the researchers didn&#39;t just study the tiny clique of elite universities that dominates the public discourse. Their sample included 139 institutions, including 50 public universities, and the results show a more complicated picture. Not all private schools are biased in favor of the rich—and some of the schools that cater most egregiously to the wealthy turn out to be public.<br><br> Like many aspects of life in our large, divided nation, the character of your local university depends a lot on where you happen to live. Big blue states such as New York and California have extensive, highly regarded university systems with no wealth bias in admissions. If anything, they have the opposite. The ultra-wealthy are almost 50 percent <i>less</i> likely to attend Berkeley than similarly qualified not-rich students. The trend applies throughout the University of California system, as well as campuses in the State University of New York. Although public-university budgets nationwide were devastated by the Great Recession, California and New York eventually <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://shef.sheeo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SHEEO_SHEF_FY22_Report.pdf">restored</a> the lost funding and invested even more. That gives them the resources to keep tuition low and creates fewer incentives to chase wealthy applicants. The sheer size of those systems also means that power and money aren&#39;t concentrated in a single flagship university with aspirations of athletic greatness. SUNY at Stony Brook and UC Santa Barbara are both top-flight research universities, but nobody is paying big money for the broadcast rights to Stony Brook Seawolves or UCSB Gauchos football games; the latter team doesn&#39;t even exist. There&#39;s no deep-seated culture of rich athletic boosters, legacy admissions, and regional aristocracy surrounding these campuses.<br><br> The story is different in other states, especially in the South. Statistically, public universities such as Auburn University, the University of Mississippi, the University of Arkansas, and the University of Alabama look a lot like the Ivy Pluses in their approach to wealth and admissions. These schools are not highly selective—most people who apply are admitted—so the mechanism for exclusion works differently than at Princeton or Yale. To measure it, the Opportunity Insights researchers looked not just at admit rates but at whether applicants were likely to apply and attend, an approach that captures the whole process of marketing, recruitment, admissions, pricing, and enrollment. Their findings suggest that a college need not be ultra-elite to perpetuate class divides. Some public universities in the South serve the same function as private colleges and universities in the Northeast: destinations for the children of political leaders and wealthy businessmen, and a mechanism for transmitting that status to the next generation. Although Alabama has one of the highest poverty rates in America, only 11 percent of Auburn students qualify for a federal Pell grant. More than <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/healthstats/assets/83t2019.pdf">30 percent</a> of college-age Alabama residents are Black, yet Black students make up <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://auburn.edu/administration/ir/factbook/enrollment-demographics/historical-summaries/enrollment-gender-ethnicity.html">less than 5 percent</a> of Auburn&#39;s student body.<br><br> So if you&#39;re wondering how public-university students in the South can afford <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sorority-consultants-rush-colleges-parents-prepare-80b2cfc8">$4,000 sorority-rush consultants</a> , as <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> recently reported, it&#39;s because their parents have money. If you&#39;re curious about why so many rich kids are on campus, it&#39;s because places like the University of Alabama give an effective 45 percent bump to the children of the top 1 percent. And if you want to know why few very low-income Black students attend these universities, it&#39;s because the schools were originally built to sustain a racist power structure that kept Black people in poverty, and those legacies have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/opinion/auburn-university-black-students.html">not yet</a> been overcome.<br><br> Representatives from the universities of Arkansas and Alabama both told me that they work hard to recruit and provide financial aid to low-income students in their respective states, which is true. Both say that income is not one of the official criteria that their admissions officers consider. But it doesn&#39;t have to be, because a very efficient unofficial filter is at play. Most of the students attending schools like the universities of Arkansas and Alabama come from other places, meaning they pay out-of-state tuition. At Alabama, where 58 percent of undergrads come from elsewhere, that amounts to $32,400 a year, plus room and board. Students who can afford such a high sticker price are wealthy almost by definition, and they are vital to public-university finances. The University of Michigan <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://admissions.umich.edu/costs-aid/costs">charges</a> out-of-state students more than $55,000, the same price as Harvard. Administrators are essentially running two institutions in parallel: a reasonably affordable public university for the residents of Michigan (in-state tuition: $16,736), and a very expensive private university for everyone else.<br><br> This dual identity shows up in the Harvard-study results. The richest and poorest students from Michigan get into Michigan at similar rates, controlling for test scores. For out-of-state students, however, there&#39;s a marked lean toward the rich. Again, this works differently than it does at elite private universities. In the Ivy Plus schools, the pro-wealth bias is accomplished with a witches&#39; brew of legacy preferences, admissions bumps for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/college-sports-benefits-white-students/573688/">patrician sports</a> such as squash and sailing, and outright <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-story-behind-jared-kushners-curious-acceptance-into-harvard">pay-to-play arrangements</a> for mega-donors. At public universities, it&#39;s a more straightforward downstream effect of pricing. Most out-of-state students get little or no financial aid, so only the rich can afford to enroll.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Universities defend these policies</span> by arguing that wealthy students subsidize their poorer classmates, who don&#39;t pay full price. But as the sociologists Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton describe in their groundbreaking 2015 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/paying-for-the-party-how-college-maintains-inequality-elizabeth-a-armstrong/9780674088023?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Paying for the Party</i></a> <i>,</i> the two-tier approach works out badly for first-generation and low-income students. Following two groups of undergraduates at Indiana University, they found that the wealthy out-of-staters sailed through four years of fraternity parties and weekend tailgates to graduate, marry, and start careers, while the first-gen students ended up with burdensome student loans, uncertain job prospects, and no degrees.<br><br> For some low-income students, the dream of attending a flagship public university turns sour. At Alabama, there&#39;s an 18-percentage-point <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=university+of+alabama&amp;s=all&amp;id=100751#outcome">gap</a> between the graduation rate of Pell-grant students and their more well-off peers, an unusually large disparity. Despite all of those out-of-state dollars, families earning less than $75,000 still pay <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=university+of+alabama&amp;s=all&amp;id=100751#expenses">about</a> $20,000 a year in total costs to attend. Auburn&#39;s numbers are similarly grim. The more public universities come to resemble private ones, the more they cater to the people who pay the bills. Consider the three mega-conferences that now dominate the college-football landscape, the SEC, Big 10, and Big 12. Michigan State, University of Florida, Purdue, University of Kentucky, Texas A&amp;M: all big-time sports schools, all running the out-of-state full-tuition racket, all skewed toward the rich.<br><br> The gap between public universities that combat wealth inequality and those that seem to perpetuate it maps onto the red/blue divide, but only roughly. Higher education in America is also shaped by idiosyncrasies of history and geography. North Carolina, a purplish state, has a great, well-funded system of affordable public universities. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has no wealth preferences, nor does North Carolina State. (Duke University, right nearby, has that covered.) Pennsylvania, a fairly blue state, has an unusually lousy tradition of inadequate funding for public universities. Penn State charges non-Pennsylvanians $38,000 a year.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Annie Lowrey: Why you have to care about these 12 colleges</a><br><br> One kind of university seems immune to all of these trends: science-and-engineering schools. Based on my analysis of the data, only five private universities in the Harvard study were <i>less</i> likely to admit applicants from the top 0.1 percent than comparably qualified middle-class students. Four of them—California Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Worcester Polytechnic University, and Case Western Reserve University—have top-class engineering programs. Among the Ivy Pluses, MIT was the least corrupted by wealth preferences. Public universities such as the Georgia Institute of Technology, Virginia Tech, and the Colorado School of Mines also had more egalitarian results.<br><br> Even the most elite liberal-arts school can create an easy glide path to graduation for the dull-witted progeny of a deep-pocketed alum. Athletic recruits can famously go from start to finish at a big state school without encountering a single challenging idea along the way. Engineering schools, by contrast, have academic standards that are harder to evade. Martin Schmidt, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic, came to the job after serving as provost at MIT. “There&#39;s a phrase we used there,” he told me, about the rigorous math and science classes all students are required to take. “&#39;There&#39;s nowhere to hide.&#39;”<br><br> Of course, not every university can or should be devoted to math and science. But the existence of these respected engineering institutions—public and private, humble and world-renowned—shows that there&#39;s nothing inevitable about higher-education systems that bend toward the gravity of wealth. If academic standards come first, the power of money recedes. Otherwise, colleges and universities become just one more thing to be bought and sold.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/public-university-wealthy-admissions/675009/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/public-university-wealthy-admissions/675009/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Right Price, Wrong Politics]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> People want to live in states with access to abortion care.

At the same time, the cost of housing in these states has diverged, too. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/19/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-jenny-schuetz.html">Blue states</a> have throttled their housing supply, leading to dramatic price increases and spurring millions of families to relocate to red states in the Sun Belt.<br><br> These trends have intensified in the past few years, as conservative legislatures have passed a raft of laws restricting abortion access and targeting LGBTQ Americans and as housing shortages have spread. Now many Americans find themselves stuck in states that are enacting conservative policies they <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/abortion-gop-electoral-problem-ohio/674999/">do not support</a> , but where real estate is cheap.<br><br> That is one takeaway from a new <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.redfin.com/news/housing-survey-florida-texas-legal-abortion/">Redfin survey</a> of people who rent their home, are thinking about moving, or have recently moved. Respondents were much more likely to say that they wanted to live in a state where abortion and gender-affirming care were legal than not. But compared with those issues, they were twice as likely to cite housing costs as a major determinant of where they would live.<br><br> The report focused on two red states, Texas and Florida. They are among the 20 states that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lwv.org/blog/abortion-rights-and-access-one-year-after-dobbs">have restricted</a> access to the medical termination of a pregnancy or banned abortion outright since the Supreme Court overturned <em>Roe v. Wade</em> last year. And they are among the two <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/transgender-laws-states.html">dozen states</a> that have implemented statutes affecting trans people: banning gender-affirming care, requiring trans youth to be identified by the gender they were assigned at birth, restricting trans kids&#39; participation in sports, or barring teachers from discussing what it means to be gay or trans.<br><br> Yet such states remain a draw for families from blue, coastal areas. “There&#39;s this trade-off between living somewhere that you can afford and where you have access to jobs,” Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin, told me, versus living “where the laws are the way that you want them to be.”<br><br> In the survey, not everyone professed a policy preference, but roughly a third of Texans and Floridians who had recently moved or were likely to move said that they would like to live somewhere with legal gender-affirming care for kids. That is eight to 16 percentage points higher than the share who said they do <em>not</em> want to live somewhere where such gender-affirming care is legal. About 40 percent of respondents in those states said they would like to live somewhere with legal abortion access, twice as many as said they would prefer to live somewhere without it.<br><br> But folks were still much more likely to say that financial considerations played a primary role in where they had settled or would settle down. The cost of living, access to jobs, the size of available homes, and proximity to family were more commonly cited factors.<br><br> Over the past two decades, the country&#39;s growing housing shortage has prevented Americans from moving <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/harvard_jchs_are_americans_stuck_in_place_frost_2020.pdf">as often as they used to</a> , and as often as would make sense given the country&#39;s wage trends. Jobs pay much more in Boston and Oakland than they do in small towns in Alabama or exurbs in Utah, a differential that has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2023/06/geographic-inequality-rise-us">grown over time</a> . But housing costs in those places rose so much <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12355/w12355.pdf">because of supply restrictions</a> that they became unaffordable and inaccessible for many would-be residents.<br><br> People who are moving tend to be moving to cheaper places. Differences in housing affordability have pulled Americans to the Sun Belt and the Mountain West, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.freddiemac.com/research/insight/20220622-pursuit-affordable-housing-migration-homebuyers-within">pushed</a> them from expensive megalopolises to smaller cities, suburbs, and exurbs. Redfin&#39;s data, for instance, show that the average home in Miami is selling for $515,000 versus $705,000 in New York, the most common origin of out-of-state movers. Homes in Dallas are half the price of homes in Los Angeles.<br><br> “Even if people would want, in a perfect world, to move to a different place that didn&#39;t have whatever-it-might-be laws, they&#39;re kept in place by these bigger, more salient forces for them,” Riordan Frost, a senior research analyst at Harvard&#39;s Joint Center for Housing Studies, told me. (Frost did not work on the Redfin project.) “Even though there are abortion restrictions, people move because of affordability.

Blue states, in contrast, have throttled their population growth. “It&#39;s a policy choice on both fronts: California has chosen to protect abortion rights, and they&#39;ve chosen to have policies that restrict housing,” Fairweather told me. “I don&#39;t even know if policy makers understand this yet. But California&#39;s housing policies have made the citizens of the United States have less access to those rights.”<br><br> In interviews, people personally affected by anti-LGBTQ laws described them as a strong motivator to leave the red states they call home. Jay Bates Domenech, a young trans person from suburban Utah, told me that the state&#39;s political climate had pushed them to spend roughly $10,000 more a semester to go to an out-of-state college: Domenech is moving to Colorado this week.<br><br> Domenech told me that they had been harassed and bullied for their gender in high school. “A few months ago, a kid followed me down the hallway calling me a pedophile. He took out his phone to take a picture of me,” they told me. “From the moment I came out, there was an underlying anxiety that something was going to happen to me.” Concerns about their physical safety and ability to access health care pushed them to move, they said, adding that they felt targeted by the state&#39;s anti-LGBTQ politicians. “The increase in suicide rates and mental-health diagnoses—it&#39;s something I am seeing at a personal, individual level,” they told me.<br><br> But many other queer and trans people don&#39;t have the money or flexibility to uproot their lives. Anthony, who asked me to withhold his last name to avoid any threats to his family, moved from Maryland to Florida five years ago, purchasing a fixer-upper for $220,000. “I&#39;m scared about what the Florida legislature is going to do,” he told me. He and his husband would like to move back to the DC area. But high interest rates and the higher cost of living would make it unaffordable to do so.<br><br> Redfin&#39;s finding that people would prefer to live in places with legal access to abortion mirrors that of many <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-poll-roe-dobbs-ban-opinion-fcfdfc5a799ac3be617d99999e92eabe">other polls</a> . States barring or tightening access to abortion have seen an 11 or 12 percentage-point increase in the share of people who say the medical procedure should be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/04/26/nearly-a-year-after-roes-demise-americans-views-of-abortion-access-increasingly-vary-by-where-they-live/">easier to obtain</a> .<br><br> In the long term, the loss of abortion access is expected to intensify the country&#39;s already intense geographic inequality. The hundreds of thousands of people forced to continue unwanted pregnancies will end up sicker and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/abortion-turnaway-study-roe-supreme-court/661246/">poorer for it</a> : Not being able to terminate a pregnancy makes a person more likely to become impoverished, unemployed, in debt, and subject to eviction, and an abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. Many companies are avoiding adding employees or doing business in states with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/08/companies-paying-for-abortion-travel-expenses/671174/">strict bans</a> .<br><br> Yet the Redfin data suggest that relatively few people will move because of changing health-care statutes. Abortion access is already heavily predicated on a person&#39;s physical location and socioeconomic status: Wealthy Texans fly to Illinois for abortions; poor Tennessee residents find themselves stuck. “There are states that were destinations for people seeking abortions where clinics have closed post-Dobbs, forming abortion deserts, particularly in the southeastern and central United States,” Betsy Pleasants, a researcher at UC Berkeley&#39;s Wallace Center for Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, told me. Those deserts are simply too formidable and expensive for many people to cross.<br><br> Sam Dickman is one person who did leave Texas as a result of the state&#39;s changing legal abortion landscape. He is a physician and an abortion provider. He and his partner moved to Montana so that he could continue to do his life&#39;s work.<br><br> “I see patients traveling in from Texas, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota, all these states surrounding Montana, to get abortion care,” he told me. “The median abortion patient is a young, low-income person of color. These are populations who are struggling to afford rent.” He added: “If I asked a patient, <em>Have you ever thought about moving to a place with better abortion access?</em> It would be item No. 15 on their radar. They would look at me like, <em>What are you talking about? I can&#39;t afford to have a kid right now. Obviously, I can&#39;t afford to move.</em> ”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/housing-survey-abortion-access-gender-affirming-care-state-policies/675017/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/housing-survey-abortion-access-gender-affirming-care-state-policies/675017/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Georgia Indictment Offers the Whole Picture]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Fani Willis filed charges against Donald Trump and 18 others, alleging a sweeping scheme to overturn the 2020 election. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ylCMLnbSHgvlha1yQZ43s_A_hbA=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/trump_georgia/original.jpg" alt="刘易斯·P·斯莱顿法院" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Elijah Nouvelage / AFP / Getty</figcaption></figure> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">, Monday through Friday.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small><br><br> If justice is blind, she sometimes heads down unpredictable paths. For example, only in Donald Trump&#39;s fourth felony indictment, unsealed last night in Atlanta, has a local prosecutor managed to deliver a sweeping, nationwide view of the former president&#39;s scheme to steal the 2020 election.<br><br> The indictment, obtained by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, accuses Trump and 18 others of a racketeering scheme, stretching across states and months, that sought to subvert the results of the election Trump lost. Some of the names are household ones, or have become so over the past three years: Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Mark Meadows. Others will be new to all but the most avid followers of the postelection machinations in Georgia.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">Earlier this month</a> , Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith charged Trump in connection with the postelection scheme, but Smith kept his indictment narrow, focusing on Trump himself and just a few of the fronts along which he tried to challenge the vote.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">David A. Graham: A brazen, dead-serious attack on American democracy</a><br><br> Willis takes a very different approach, with 41 counts against the 19 defendants. Crucially, the charges are brought under Georgia&#39;s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. That&#39;s a favorite of the prosecutor—“I&#39;m a fan of RICO,” she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/why-georgias-rico-law-could-be-key-in-the-states-case-against-trump">said in a news conference</a> about a gang-related case last year—and it allows her to charge a large number of people with a concerted effort toward a goal, even if not all members of the group committed all of the crimes involved.<br><br> The indictment charges that Trump, the 18 co-defendants, and 30 other unindicted co-conspirators “constituted a criminal organization whose members and associates engaged in various related criminal activities including, but not limited to, false statements and writings, impersonating a public officer, forgery, filing false documents, influencing witnesses, computer theft, computer trespass, computer invasion of privacy, conspiracy to defraud the state, acts involving theft, and perjury.”<br><br> This indictment is not a gripping read, stretching over 80-some pages and collecting 161 separate alleged overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. But in its comprehensive scope, it gives a fuller picture of Trump&#39;s attack on American democracy than any other indictment so far. In many ways, it echoes the report put together by the House committee on January 6 that completed its work earlier this year, just before Republicans took over the majority.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/criminal-justice-system-and-election-are-not-going-get-along/673971/">David A. Graham: The criminal-justice system and the election are not going to get along</a><br><br> The elements of the conspiracy include crimes specific to Georgia: a breach of voting machines in Coffee County; an attempt to intimidate Ruby Freeman, an election worker in Fulton County; lies told to Georgia officials and attempts to enlist them in the election subversion; the creation of false slates of electors to be submitted to the Electoral College.<br><br> But the indictment also sweeps up crimes committed by the defendants elsewhere, including similar efforts at the state level in Arizona and Pennsylvania, an attempt to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/jeffrey-clark-doj-weaponization-trump-indictment/674898/">leverage the Justice Department</a> to help justify subversion schemes, and a ploy to get then–Vice President Mike Pence to throw a wrench in the January 6, 2021, certification of the election.<br><br> It is remarkable, and a bit troubling, to see a local official like Willis—even one in a huge county like Fulton—bringing charges of this scope. On the one hand, common sense says that the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/trumps-coup-before-january-6/620998/">paperwork coup</a> , whether or not it was criminal, was clearly a connected whole and not a series of isolated actions, and so it makes sense to treat it as such in court. Smith&#39;s August indictment is an odd document, hitting some elements hard while ignoring others.<br><br> On the other hand, an attempt to undermine the presidential election on a national scale is clearly a matter larger than any county prosecutor&#39;s purview. A nation in which local district attorneys feel empowered to charge presidents, current or former, is a potentially chaotic one. (What&#39;s to stop conservative prosecutors in small counties from bringing flimsy charges against Joe Biden?)<br><br> Willis has the freedom to bring a much broader case in part <em>because</em> she is a local prosecutor. Though under Merrick Garland, the Justice Department has emphasized its distance from politics, Smith must know how politically incendiary and possibly unworkable an enormous federal RICO indictment would be. Perhaps even more important, he knows that if Trump or another Republican wins the 2024 election, they will likely try to shut down any federal prosecution as soon as they take office—encouraging him to keep his case tightly focused and fast-moving. Willis, an elected official, doesn&#39;t have the same political constraints, and her case isn&#39;t subject to the whims of the federal executive branch.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/">David A. Graham: Trump is acting like he&#39;s cornered</a><br><br> But proving such a case will be difficult. RICO cases are famously complicated, unwieldy, and sometimes confounding to jurors, even in less politically charged situations. In a statement last night, Trump argued that his actions as charged under the indictment constitute free speech. “They are taking away President Trump&#39;s First Amendment right to free speech, and the right to challenge a rigged and stolen election that the Democrats do all the time,” he said.<br><br> Trump also complained that the charges have taken too long to bring. Without any evidence, he wrote that Willis had “strategically stalled her investigation to try and maximally interfere with the 2024 presidential race,” adding, “They could have brought this two and half years ago.” Though investigations take time, he&#39;s got a point. Still, underscoring that all Americans were aware of his subversion scheme at the time it was happening is not as exculpatory as Trump might like to pretend.<br><br> Whatever the reasons for the timeline, Willis has speed on her mind now. She said at a press conference after the indictments were released that she wanted to bring all 19 defendants to trial together within the next six months. That would put the case right in the heat of the Republican primary.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/criminal-justice-system-and-election-are-not-going-get-along/673971/">As I have written</a> , the criminal-justice and political systems are not just designed to not work well together; they are designed to be separate. This case is about Trump testing the strength of the American system of governance; trying it will be yet another chance for him to test it.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 04:30:11 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-georgia-indictment-election/675018/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-georgia-indictment-election/675018/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[I'm a Black Professor.

I had arrived a few hours before check-in, hoping to drop off my bags before I met a friend for lunch. The employees were clearly frazzled, overwhelmed by the sudden influx of several hundred impatient academics. When I asked where I could put my luggage, the guy at the front desk simply pointed to a nearby hallway. “Wait over there with her; he&#39;s coming back.”<br><br> Who “he” was remained unclear, but I saw the woman he was referring to. She was white and about my age. She had a conference badge and a large suitcase that she was rolling back and forth in obvious exasperation. “Been waiting long?” I asked, taking up a position on the other side of the narrow hallway. “ <i>Very</i> ,” she replied. For a while, we stood in silence, minding our phones. Eventually, we began chatting.<br><br> The conversation was wide-ranging: the papers we were presenting, the bad A/V at the hotel, our favorite things to do in the city. At some point, we began talking about our jobs. She told me that— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/upshot/academic-job-crisis-phd.html">like so many academics</a> —she was juggling a temporary teaching gig while also looking for a tenure-track position.<br><br> “It&#39;s hard,” she said, “too many classes, too many students, too many papers to grade. No time for your own work. Barely any time to apply to <i>real</i> jobs.”<br><br> When I nodded sympathetically, she asked about my job and whether it was tenure-track. I admitted, a little sheepishly, that it was.<br><br> “I&#39;d love to teach at a small college like that,” she said. “I feel like none of my students wants to learn. It&#39;s exhausting.”<br><br> Then, out of nowhere, she said something that caught me completely off guard: “But I shouldn&#39;t be complaining to you about this. I know <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/10/21/scholars-talk-about-being-black-campus-2020">how hard</a> BIPOC faculty have it. You&#39;re the last person I should be whining to.”<br><br> I was taken aback, but I shouldn&#39;t have been. It was the kind of awkward comment I&#39;ve grown used to over the past few years, as “anti-racism” has become the reigning ideology of progressive political culture. Until recently, calling attention to a stranger&#39;s race in such a way would have been considered a social faux pas. That she made the remark without thinking twice—a remark, it should be noted, that assumes being a Black tenure-track professor is <i>worse</i> than being a marginally employed white one—shows how profoundly interracial social etiquette has changed since 2020&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/16/902179773/summer-of-racial-reckoning-the-match-lit">“summer of racial reckoning.”</a> That&#39;s when anti-racism—focused on combating “color-blindness” in both policy and personal conduct—grabbed ahold of the liberal mainstream.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/tyre-nichols-death-memphis-george-floyd-police-reform/672986/">Wesley Lowery: Why there was no racial reckoning</a><br><br> Though this “reckoning” brought increased public attention to the deep embeddedness of racism in supposedly color-blind American institutions, it also made instant celebrities of a number of race experts and “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) consultants who believe that being anti-racist means undergoing a<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gsb-sites.stanford.edu/anti-racism-and-allyship/">“journey”</a> of radical personal transformation. In their righteous crusade against the bad color-blindness of policies such as race-neutral college admissions, these contemporary anti-racists have also jettisoned the kind of <i>good</i> color-blindness that holds that we are more than our race, and that we should conduct our social life according to that idealized principle. Rather than balance a critique of color-blind law and policy with a continuing embrace of interpersonal color-blindness as a social etiquette, contemporary anti-racists throw the baby out with the bathwater. In place of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/actually-color-blindness-isnt-racist">the old color-blind ideal</a> , they have foisted upon well-meaning white liberals a successor social etiquette predicated on the necessity of foregrounding racial difference rather than minimizing it.<br><br> As a Black guy who grew up in a politically purple area—where being a good person meant adhering to the kind of civil-rights-era color-blindness that is now passé—I find this emergent anti-racist culture jarring. Many of my liberal friends and acquaintances now seem to believe that being a good person means constantly reminding Black people that you are aware of their Blackness. Difference, no longer to be politely ignored, is insisted upon at all times under the guise of acknowledging “positionality.” Though I am rarely made to feel excessively aware of my race when hanging out with more conservative friends or visiting my hometown, in the more liberal social circles in which I typically travel, my race is constantly invoked—“acknowledged” and “centered”—by well-intentioned anti-racist “allies.”<br><br> This “acknowledgement” tends to take one of two forms. The first is the song and dance in which white people not-so-subtly let <i>you</i> know that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/opinion/not-a-racist.html"><i>they</i> know that race and racism exist</a> . This includes finding ways to interject discussion of some (bad) news item about race or racism into casual conversation, apologizing for having problems while white (“You&#39;re the last person I should be whining to”), or inversely, offering “support” by attributing any normal human problem <i>you</i> have to racism.<br><br> The second way good white liberals often “center” racial difference in everyday interactions with minorities is by trying, always clumsily, to ensure that their “marginalized” friends and familiars are “culturally” comfortable. My favorite personal experiences of this include an acquaintance who invariably steers dinner or lunch meetups to Black-owned restaurants, and the time that a friend of a friend invited me over to go swimming in their pool before apologizing for assuming that I know how to swim (“I know that&#39;s a culturally specific thing”). It is a peculiar quirk of the 2020s&#39; racial discourse that this kind of “acknowledgement” and “centering” is viewed as progress.<br><br> My point is not that conservatives have better racial politics— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/08/07/opinion/florida-board-education-slavery-nazism/">they do not</a> —but rather that something about current progressive racial discourse has become warped and distorted. The anti-racist culture that is ascendant seems to me to have little to do with combatting structural racism or cultivating better relationships between white and Black Americans. And its rejection of color-blindness as a social ethos is not a new frontier of radical political action.<br><br> No, at the core of today&#39;s anti-racism is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/15/black-lives-matter-george-floyd-protests-policy-change/">little more than a vibe shift</a> —a soft matrix of conciliatory gestures and hip phraseology that give adherents the <i>feeling</i> that there has been a cultural change, when in fact we have merely put carpet over the rotting floorboards. Although this push to center rather than sidestep racial difference in our interpersonal relationships comes from a good place, it tends to rest on a troubling, even racist subtext: that white and Black Americans are so radically different that interracial relationships require careful management, constant eggshell-walking, and even expert guidance from professional anti-racists. Rather than producing racial harmony, this new ethos frequently has the opposite effect, making white-Black interactions stressful, unpleasant, or, perhaps most often, simply weird.<br><br> Since the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, progressive anti-racism has centered on two concepts that helped Americans make sense of his senseless death: “structural racism” and “implicit bias.” The first of these is a sociopolitical concept that highlights how certain institutions— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/12/upshot/child-maternal-mortality-rich-poor.html">maternity wards</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/16/us/minneapolis-police-george-floyd">police barracks</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/08/25/the-secret-bias-hidden-in-mortgage-approval-algorithms">lending companies</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-settlement-race-discrimination-lawsuit-against-public-housing">housing authorities</a> , etc.—produce and replicate racial inequalities, such as the disproportionate killing of Black men by the cops. The second is a psychological<i> </i>concept that describes the way that all individuals—from bleeding-heart liberals to murderers such as Derek Chauvin—harbor varying degrees of subconscious racial prejudice.<br><br> Though “structural racism” and “implicit bias” target different scales of the social order—institutions on the one hand, individuals on the other—underlying both of these ideas is a critique of so-called color-blind ideology, or what the sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva calls “color-blind racism”: the idea that policies, interactions, and rhetoric can be explicitly race-neutral but implicitly racist. As concepts, both “structural racism” and “implicit bias” rest on the presupposition that racism is an enduring feature of institutional and social life, and that so-called race neutrality is a covertly racist myth that perpetuates inequality. Some anti-racist scholars such as Uma Mazyck Jayakumar and Ibram X. Kendi have put this even more bluntly: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/supreme-court-affirmative-action-race-neutral-admissions/674565/">“&#39;Race neutral&#39; is the new “separate but equal.&#39;”</a> Yet, although anti-racist academics and activists are <i>right</i> to argue that race-neutral policies can&#39;t solve racial inequities—that supposedly color-blind laws and policies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/colorblind-constitution/602221/">are often anything but</a> —over the past few years, this line of criticism has also been bizarrely extended to color-blindness as a <i>personal</i> ethos governing behavior at the individual level.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/colorblind-constitution/602221/">Theodore R.

The problem with color-blindness, Joseph counsels, is it allows “white people to continue to be comfortable.” The NFL analyst Emmanuel Acho wrote an entire book, simply called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/uncomfortable-conversations-with-a-black-man-emmanuel-acho/9781250800473?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man</i></a> , that admonishes readers to “stop celebrating color-blindness.” And, of course, there are endless <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/real-friends-talk-about-race-yseult-p-mukantabanahannah-summerhill?variant=40582692667426"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/real-friends-talk-about-race-bridging-the-gaps-through-uncomfortable-conversations-yseult-p-mukantabana/9780778387053?affiliate_id=atl-347">how-to guides</a> for having these “uncomfortable conversations” with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://katiecouric.com/lifestyle/relationships/how-to-talk-about-racism/">your Black friends</a> .<br><br> Once the dominant progressive ideology, professing “I don&#39;t see color” is now viewed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danabrownlee/2022/06/19/dear-white-people-when-you-say-you-dont-see-color-this-is-what-we-really-hear/?sh=b4c50c726d60">as a kind of dog whistle</a> that papers over implicit bias. Instead, current anti-racist wisdom holds that we must acknowledge racial difference in our interactions with others, rather than assume that race needn&#39;t be at the center of every interracial conversation or encounter. Coming to grips with the transition we have undergone over the past decade—color-blind etiquette&#39;s swing from de rigueur to racist—requires a longer view of an American cultural transition. Civil-rights-era color-blindness was replaced with an individualistic, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/how-to-build-an-anti-racist-company">corporatized anti-racism</a> , one focused on the purification of white psyches through racial discomfort, guilt, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/07/protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-wokeness/">“doing the work”</a> as a road to self-improvement.<br><br> Writing in 1959, the social critic Philip Rieff argued that postwar America was transforming from a religious and economic culture—one oriented around common institutions such as the church and the market—to a <i>psychological</i> culture, one oriented around the self and its emotional fulfillment. By the 1960s, Rieff had given this shift a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Therapeutic-Background-Essential-Conservative/dp/1932236805">name</a> : “the triumph of the therapeutic,” which he defined as an emergent worldview according to which the “self, improved, is the ultimate concern of modern culture.” Yet, even as he diagnosed our culture with self-obsession, Rieff also noticed something peculiar and even paradoxical. Therapeutic culture demanded that we reflect our self-actualization <i>outward</i> . Sharing our innermost selves with the world—good, bad, and ugly—became a new social mandate under the guise that authenticity and open self-expression are necessary for social cohesion.<br><br> Recent anti-racist mantras like “White silence is violence” reflect this same sentiment: exhibitionist displays of “racist” guilt are viewed as a necessary precursor to racial healing and community building. In this way, today&#39;s attacks on interpersonal color-blindness—and progressives&#39; growing fixation on implicit bias, public confession, and race-conscious social etiquette—are only the most recent manifestations of the cultural shift Rieff described. Indeed, the seeds of the current backlash against color-blindness began decades ago, with the application of a New Age, therapeutic outlook to race relations: so-called racial-sensitivity training, the forefather of today&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/antiracism-training-white-fragility-robin-diangelo-ibram-kendi.html">equally spurious</a> DEI programming.<br><br> In her 2001 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/race-experts-how-racial-etiquette-sensitivity-training-and-new-age-therapy-hijacked-the-civil-rights-revolution-elisabeth-lasch-quinn/9780742527591?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Race Experts</i></a> , the historian Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn painstakingly details how racial-sensitivity training emerged from the 1960s&#39; human-potential movement and its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/encounter-movement-a-fad-last-decade-finds-new-shape-tried-by.html">infamous “encounter groups.”</a> As she explains, what began as a more or less countercultural phenomenon was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-radical-history-of-corporate-sensitivity-training#:~:text=It%2520was%2520born%2520amid%2520the,fears%252C%2520biases%252C%2520and%2520emotions.">later corporatized</a> in the form of the anemic, pointless workshops <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/comedy-central-caves-cancel-culture-removes-episode-office-line-1623873">controversially lampooned on <i>The Office</i></a> . Not surprisingly, this shift <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ideas.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Anand-Winters-2008.pdf">reflected the ebb and flow of corporate interests</a> : Whereas early workplace training emphasized compliance with the newly minted Civil Rights Act of 1964, later incarnations would focus on improving employee relations and, later still, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hbr.org/2022/06/stop-making-the-business-case-for-diversity">leveraging diversity</a> to secure <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/biancamillercole/2020/09/15/8-reasons-why-diversity-and-inclusion-are-essential-to-business-success/?sh=2c9d53581824">better business outcomes</a> .<br><br> If there is something distinctive about the anti-color-blind racial etiquette that has emerged since George Floyd&#39;s death, it is that these sites of encounter have shifted from official institutional spaces to more intimate ones where white people and minorities interact as friends, neighbors, colleagues, and acquaintances. Racial-awareness raising is a dynamic no longer quarantined to formalized, compulsory settings like the boardroom or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2963111">freshman orientation</a> . Instead, every interracial interaction is a potential scene of (one-way) racial edification and supplication, encounters in which good white liberals are expected to be transparent about their “positionality,” confront their “whiteness,” and—if the situation calls for it—confess their “implicit bias.”<br><br> In a vacuum, many of the prescriptions advocated by the anti-color-blind crowd are reasonable: We <i>should</i> all think more about our privileges and our place in the world. An uncomfortable conversation or an honest look in the mirror <i>can be</i> precursors to personal growth. We <i>all</i> carry around harmful, implicit biases and we <i>do</i> need to examine the subconscious assumptions and prejudices that underlie the actions we take and the things we say. My objection is not to these ideas themselves, which are sensible enough. No, my objection is that anti-racism offers little more than a Marie Kondo–ism for the white soul, promising to declutter racial baggage and clear a way to white fulfillment without doing anything meaningful to combat structural racism. As Lasch-Quinn correctly foresaw, “Casting interracial problems as issues of etiquette [puts] a premium on superficial symbols of good intentions and good motivations as well as on style and appearance rather than on the substance of change.”<br><br> Yet the problem with the therapeutics of contemporary anti-racism is not just that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Antiracism.html">they are politically sterile</a> . When anti-color-blindness and its ideology of insistent “race consciousness” are translated into the sphere of private life—to the domain of friendships, block parties, and backyard barbecues—they assault the very idea of a multiracial society, producing new forms of racism in the process. The fact that our media environment is inundated with an endless stream of books, articles, and social-media tutorials that promise to teach white people how to simply <i>interact</i> with the Black people in their life is not a sign of anti-racist progress, but of profound regression.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/dei-training-initiatives-consultants-companies-skepticism/674237/">Conor Friedersdorf: The DEI industry needs to check its privilege</a><br><br> The subtext that undergirds this new anti-racist discourse—that Black-white relationships are inherently fraught and must be navigated with the help of professionals and technical experts—testifies to the impoverishment of our interracial imagination, not to its enrichment. More gravely, anti-color-blind etiquette treats Black Americans as exotic others, permanent strangers whose racial difference is so chasmic that it must be continually managed, whose mode of humanness is so foreign that it requires white people to adopt a special set of manners and “race conscious” ritualistic practices to even have a simple conversation.<br><br> If we are going to find a way out of the racial discord that has defined American life post-Trump and post-Charlottesville and post-Floyd, we have to begin with a more sophisticated understanding of color-blindness, one that rejects the bad color-blindness on offer from the Republican Party and its partisans, as well as the <i>anti</i> -color-blindness of the anti-racist consultants. Instead, we should embrace the good color-blindness of not too long ago. At the heart of <i>that</i> color-blindness was a radical claim, one imperfectly realized but perfect as an ideal: that despite the weight of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88478467">a racist past that isn&#39;t even past</a> , we can imagine a world, or at least an interaction between two people, where racial difference doesn&#39;t make a difference.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/anti-racist-color-blindness-dei-programs/674996/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/anti-racist-color-blindness-dei-programs/674996/</item></channel></rss>
