Pyne） <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-pyrocene-how-we-created-an-age-of-fire-and-what-happens-next-stephen-j-pyne/9780520383586?affiliate_id=atl-347">称之为</a>“火新世”。人类仍在思考如何在这个新现实中生活，在我们周围的世界在燃烧时迎头赶上。<br><br>尽管火灾是许多景观的自然组成部分——并且已经存在了几个世纪——但火灾和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/wildfire-smoke-brain-health/674336/">烟雾科学</a>的某些领域还处于相对初级阶段。火灾中大规模疏散的最佳实践<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/07/wildfire-evacuation-plans-california-alaska/670969/">仍然不存在</a>；毛伊岛副州长表示， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/wind-fanned-fires-raze-parts-hawaii-forcing-evacuations-2023-08-09/">由于停电，毛伊岛的疏散工作变得更加复杂</a>。夏威夷大学马诺阿分校的消防专家克莱·特劳尼希特 (Clay Trauernicht) 表示，夏威夷与加利福尼亚州等火灾多发州没有相同的野火历史，这意味着准备工作较少。他对该州火灾的两个潜在促成因素表示特别担忧： <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/08/10/us/wildfires-maui-hawaii/hawaii-used-to-be-covered-with-plantations-the-grass-replacing-them-is-a-fire-hazard?smid=url-share">陈旧、维护不善的前</a><a

2017 年索诺玛县塔布斯火灾期间也出现了类似的情况。“一旦你从着火的建筑物转到另一座建筑物，你就无能为力了，”Trauernicht 告诉我。我问他这是否是夏威夷为未来更强烈的野火做好准备的警钟。 “如果不是，说实话，我不知道会发生什么，”他回答道。<br><br>美国国家气象局檀香山预报办公室的气象学家伊恩·莫里森告诉我，每年这个时候在夏威夷看到火灾天气（炎热、干燥、多风的天气）并不罕见。国家气象局已对该地区发出危险信号警告， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/14/1169979511/red-flag-warning-fire-prevention-tips">这向当地居民和官员表明野火的可能性很高</a>。据美国干旱监测机构称，毛伊岛大部分地区也异常干燥或处于干旱状态；西边尤其干燥，随时可能着火。<br><br>您可能认为朵拉可以缓解这些情况：飓风通常意味着水，而潮湿的东西不容易燃烧。但即使是这种动态也在发生变化。夏威夷大学马诺阿分校的研究人员进行的一项调查发现，2018 年的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hawaii.edu/news/2020/07/22/hurricane-lane-fire-rain/">飓风莱恩同时给夏威夷带来了火灾和降雨</a>，使应急响应变得更加复杂——干燥和多风的条件使火势在风暴边缘蔓延，而在其他地方，降雨导致山体滑坡。 2020 年，研究人员指出，莱恩只是有记录的三个飓风加剧野火风险的案例之一。有了朵拉，我们可能会有第四个。<br><br> <a

《<em>我们的最后警告：六度气候紧急情况》</em>一书的作者马克·莱纳斯告诉我：“不同类型的气候灾难都相互加剧。” “这一切都反映了这样一个事实：随着世界变暖，系统中的能量越来越多。水蒸发得更快；风刮得更大了；火势变得更猛烈。”<br><br>莱纳斯则告诉我，他没有考虑过这种特殊的动态：“我从未想到飓风与野火之间存在联系。事实上，它只是表明了气候变暖可能带来的各种意外。”毛伊岛大火可能给夏威夷敲响了警钟。但也许它们也可以为我们其他人敲响警钟，这是近年来的众多警钟之一。火灾时代正在我们周围肆虐。<br><br></div>

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/trump-twitter-account-special-counsel-search-warrant/674969/">永远不要发推文。</a></li><strong>对民主的关注</strong><br><br><b>汤姆·尼科尔斯：</b> <i>《华盛顿周刊》</i>和<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>本身就是机构。将他们联合起来开展这样一个项目的目标是什么？也许我不应该说“像这样的程序”，而应该先问你设想什么样的程序。<br><br><b>杰弗里·戈德堡：</b>我的目标是我认为<i>《华盛顿周》</i>已经做得非常好的事情：我想与实际报道本周事件的记者进行讨论，以便观众不仅了解正在发生的事情，而且了解正在发生的事情。这些故事是如何报道的。我们需要时间与在场的人进行更详细的对话，他们会告诉我们发生了什么。这个程序的一大优点是它允许人们在整个段落中说话，而我是段落的忠实粉丝。<br><br><b>汤姆：</b>这对你来说是一个新的演出，对吧？你从来没有当过主持人。<br><br><b>杰夫：</b>对。我已经参加过数以百万计的电视和会议专题讨论会——唉，我再也回不去了——但这是我第一次担任主持人。所以我的建议是你看一下，看看我是否能够从提词器中读出内容。这个问题尚无定论。<br><br><b>汤姆：</b>既然你要坐在办公桌的<i>另</i>一边，你打算如何主持这个节目呢？格式会是什么样子？<br><br><b>杰夫：</b>我讨厌让事情听起来如此简单，因为，如你所知，我是一个复杂的人。但这里的目标是找到媒体中最优秀的人才，让他们分析正在发生的事情。我希望人们在观看此内容后感觉自己确实学到了一些东西。<br><br><b>汤姆：</b>嗯，我认为这并不简单，但这听起来像是对有线电视时代之前更古老、更具对话性的新闻节目传统的回调。<br><br><b>杰夫：</b>从某种程度上来说，确实如此。一些电视新闻和公共事务节目已经变得过于狂热，不合我的口味。在简短的片段中，观众会受到灯光和蜂鸣器的轰炸，其中有六七个人或更多的人试图尽快阐明观点。其中一些人是党派黑客。现在电视上很少有一群记者进行真正的对话，我们将花时间进行更耐心的对话。<br><br><b>汤姆：</b>但这不就是观众想要的——闪光和运动吗？<br><br><b>杰夫：</b>看，这个国家有很多人。有些人想要 TikTok；有些人想要 TikTok；有些人想要 TikTok。有些人想要<i>《大西洋月刊》</i> 。有些人两者都想要。不一定是你或我——当然，尽管你是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@theatlantic/video/7166692270241090859">TikTok 明星</a>。但我确信存在维恩重叠。在<i>大西洋</i>，<i> </i>我们知道我们的读者有很强的注意力。 <i>《华盛顿周刊》</i>和<i>PBS NewsHour</i>的观众也是如此。看看有多少人会听长播客、阅读长文章。我们将针对该计划提供足够的空间来进行详细讨论。<br><br><b>汤姆：</b>等我把我的猫带上 TikTok 再说吧。但回到电视上，这种狂热的活动在很大程度上是由党派之争驱动的。这些节目邀请党派拥护者在五分钟内就复杂的问题进行决斗，尽管我在这方面并非没有罪恶，但我同意这可能会让人发疯。尽管如此，选举即将到来，人们将关注 2024 年。 <i>《大西洋月刊华盛顿周刊》</i>将如何应对这将是相当奇怪的一年？<br><br><b>杰夫：</b>今年不仅是奇怪的一年，而且也是奇怪的一年。这是美国历史上独一无二的选举。一名受到州和联邦起诉的前总统正在与击败他的人进行竞选，他最终可能会入狱或入主白宫。但<i>《华盛顿周刊》</i>和<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>都是无党派的。<i>大西洋报</i>的<i> </i>我们的座右铭是“不属于任何党派或派系”——但我们确实非常关心美国理念、民主及其生存，我想将对民主的关注从<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>带到<i>《华盛顿周刊》</i> 。<br><br><b>汤姆：</b>你将主要与来自媒体的其他人交谈，而人们非常不信任记者。你认为这对于节目来说是一个问题吗？<br><br><b>杰夫：</b>公众不信任很多机构，尤其是记者，是的。我们生活在一个很多人都往别人最坏的方面想的时代。这种不信任使得人们很难及时了解情况，这对民主不利。这就是为什么不仅报道故事很重要，而且向观众解释这些故事<i>是如何</i>报道的也很重要。<br><br><b>汤姆：</b>你是已故格温·伊菲尔的朋友，他帮助<i>《华盛顿周刊》</i>成为一个机构。通过观察她，你学到了什么？<br><br><b>杰夫：</b>格温相信新闻业，她相信存在可观察到的现实，她不害怕任何事或任何人，她相信美国的承诺。她是有史以来最伟大的人之一。她拥有这样的权威，部分原因是她知道真相，并相信她有重要的工作要做。它还来自于作为一个先驱者，作为一个黑人女性，这个行业并不总是对改变、对其他声音开放感兴趣。她确实是我的英雄之一，作为朋友，我每天都想念她。她在特朗普当选后不久就去世了，在过去的七年里，这个国家真的可以利用她的技能、洞察力和无畏精神。<br><br><strong>今日新闻</strong><br><br><li>厄瓜多尔总统候选人费尔南多·比亚维森西奥（Fernando

<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/04/mohammed-bin-salman-saudi-arabia-palace-interview/622822/">摘自2022年4月号：绝对权力</a><br><br>一项好的协议是使以色列和海湾国家之间本已升温的关系正式化，同时允许美国——在过去三十年里在该地区花费了不可估量的鲜血和财富——减少在中东的时间和金钱。<br><br>因此，以色列和沙特阿拉伯之间的联姻并不是一场胜利。以色列和埃及之间的和平协议提供了一个警示性的例子。当时，该协议受到欢迎，因为两国在三十年里打了四场灾难性的战争，而该协议在美国对埃及的军事援助的支持下，使这个阿拉伯语世界上人口最多的国家脱离了苏联的轨道。但今天的埃及人民很大程度上憎恨以色列。两国之间几乎没有有意义的社会或经济联系，而目前陷入混乱的政治和金融问题的埃及对以色列持怀疑态度，而不是将其视为合作伙伴。<br><br>以色列和约旦之间的和平也类似。这两种关系取决于美元、安曼和开罗的独裁政权以及受影响国家军事和安全部门之间的合作。两项和平协议都在参与者中培养了一种权利意识：埃及、以色列和约旦政府都认为自己每年欠数十亿美元的军事援助，并对任何可能减少此类援助的建议表示愤怒。埃及的问题尤其严重，该国军队是该国最强大的政治角色，但依赖援助来提供就业机会和保护其经济利益。<br><br>继 2020 年《亚伯拉罕协议》之后，以色列和阿拉伯联合酋长国之间迅速发展的关系，在某种程度上感觉与埃及和约旦的关系有所不同。以色列和阿联酋领导人对中东其他地区的看法彼此相似（而且应该说，通常与华盛顿的看法不同）。例如，穆罕默德·本·扎耶德和他的儿子和兄弟对伊朗和逊尼派伊斯兰主义者构成的威胁与任何以色列人一样感到震惊，而阿联酋雄心勃勃的主权财富基金与以色列初创生态系统之间的协同效应也充满希望。以色列人有理由访问阿布扎比和迪拜，阿联酋人有理由访问海法、耶路撒冷和特拉维夫。每个国家都可以为对方做出贡献——阿联酋的资本、以色列的创新。<br><br>以色列和沙特阿拉伯也应该如此。总体而言，海湾地区是目前世界上为数不多的经济亮点之一。海湾地区的主权财富基金拥有来自石油和天然气收入的大量现金，在国内外大手笔支出，而西方私募股权和风险投资公司则寻求在该地区筹集资金。<br><br>沙特阿拉伯拥有所有富裕的海湾国家中最大的消费者基础，这就是为什么零售商和消费品制造商在那里花费的时间比卡塔尔或阿联酋等国家更多的原因。王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼的经济改革使在沙特阿拉伯做生意比过去几年更具吸引力，并且更多的西方公司——当然是在利雅得的压力下——将其区域业务的基础设在沙特阿拉伯，而不是在沙特阿拉伯。阿联酋。<br><br>以色列人可能希望在沙特阿拉伯投资，而沙特人几乎肯定会想在以色列投资。这种对两国关系正常化的激励应该足够了，美国不应该觉得有义务提供更多。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/06/israeli-saudi-relations/395015/">阅读：以色列和沙特阿拉伯——终于在一起了？</a><br><br>尽管如此，有传言称美国计划增加对沙特和以色列安全的承诺，这一前景令我感到担忧。以色列与其邻国之间的和平应该允许美国在该地区部署<em>更少的</em>资源，而不是更多。但美国外交官常常低估他们代表五角大楼做出的承诺。<br><br> 2015 年的伊朗协议就是一个有用的例子。由于一些非常充分的理由，五角大楼被排除在美国和伊朗之间的谈判之外，而较为乐观的政府成员希望这可能会导致美国对该地区政策的新时代。但该协议本身实际上锁定了美国在附近的强大军事态势，以强制伊朗遵守协议：协议签署后，将美军从海湾转移到东亚变得更加困难，而不是更容易。<br><br>我担心，对沙特阿拉伯或以色列做出的任何正式安全承诺都可能会在未来几十年内向中东派遣数万名美军。在冲突中将美军调入海湾比您想象的要困难，因此为了应对突发事件，您需要的大部分物资必须提前部署到该地区。 （在奥巴马政府执政结束时，约有 35,000 名美军半永久驻扎在海湾地区。）美国不应以优先考虑太平洋战区为代价，对中东（昨天的战争现场）做出新的安全承诺。<br><br>不过，我理解耶路撒冷和华盛顿的热情。尽管我担心美国可能会为了完成协议而做出不明智且最终不必要的承诺，但拜登政府——是的，还有之前的特朗普政府——值得高度赞扬。感谢您让我们如此接近对以色列、沙特阿拉伯和美国外交来说将是一项重大成就。<br><br></div>

data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dennisk/texts/introwindgourd.html">传说</a>中，葫芦里蕴含着夏威夷所有的风——只有知道对每个人唱什么歌的人才能召唤出这些风。葫芦本身以夏威夷仁慈的风之女神 La&#39;a Maomao 命名。<br><br>本周早些时候，当我观察到异常猛烈的风吹过考艾岛的棕榈树时，我发现自己想起了葫芦，比我记忆中在夏威夷见过的还要强烈，然后几个小时后，当紧急警报响起时，我又想起了葫芦。出，提醒我注意同样的风在东部约 190 英里的毛伊岛引发的可怕火灾。当疏散令下达时，毛伊岛历史悠久的拉海纳小镇已无希望免遭毁灭。目前官方称至少有 36 人死亡。整个事情发生得快得令人难以理解——快得人们从火焰中跳入大海试图自救。<br><br><a

Tonggs，距离如此之近，我可以听到透过卧室窗户的海浪声，我经常在太平洋海啸预警中心网站打开的情况下入睡在我的手机上，它像枕头下的护身符一样闪闪发光。我喜欢在昏昏欲睡之前看到网站顶部的绿色横幅<span class="smallcaps">——没有海啸警报、咨询、监视或威胁</span>。但我从未想过要担心岛上发生野火。<br><br> “幸运的是，我们住在夏威夷”是这里的一句俗语，这句话看似甜蜜，但实际上是一种深切的感激之情的表达：对夏威夷人民的善良、对丰富的土地、对美好生活的品质的欣赏。光线，以及这个地方的整体柔和感——铁木的画笔针，挂满成熟芒果的树，冬天的夜空看起来更加紫色。<br><br>和其他地方一样，这里也发生了可怕的事情，而不仅仅是本周火灾的恐怖。当人们称其为“天堂”时，当地人有时会感到愤怒，这是有充分理由的。不止一次，来自东海岸的记者同事得知我是檀香山的记者后，会说<i>“哇，你报道什么？”</i>之类的话。<i>草裙舞和迈泰酒？</i>这样的评论让我意识到那些自以为好奇的人是多么无知。他们本可以发现但从未费心去学习的东西，这让我很生气。<br><br>夏威夷是一个极其复杂的地方，任何热爱夏威夷的人都会告诉你。也许这就是为什么拉海纳突然被烧成平地如此令人惊讶，即使它不应该如此。<br><br>通常，夏威夷让人感觉关系密切，就像每个人都认识每个人一样。发生任何大事之后，感觉就更小了。昨天，我花了大部分时间与岛上的朋友以及夏威夷的各种侨民聊天和发短信，而毛伊岛和大岛仍然在燃烧。一位朋友告诉我，他的一位朋友连夜飞往毛伊岛灭火。另一个人的小儿子和他的祖父母在毛伊岛，每个人都很好，但他们已经 24 小时没有电力或可靠的通讯。另一位朋友，她在拉海纳度过了整个童年，后来搬到了毛伊岛内陆地区，她发短信确认她的<i>家人</i>一切都好，一切都已确定。贯穿所有这些信息的明确主题——除了一遍又一遍地在两个方向上<i>说“谢天谢地，你没事</i>”——是一种明显的措手不及的感觉。我和几个在这里出生和长大的朋友交谈过，没有人记得这样的火灾，甚至没有人记得发生过这样的火灾。夏末的灌木丛火灾时有发生，但总是很容易得到控制。像我一样，没有人记得曾经担心过火灾。<br><br>在夏威夷，孩子们被教导要尊重自然——火山的古老愤怒、海洋的巨大力量和无限回报。每年夏天，飓风都会像发条一样在太平洋上翻滚，但由于物理和偶然的宇宙恩典，它们很少袭击。 （1992 年以 4 级风暴摧毁考艾岛的伊尼基飓风和 1982 年以 1 级风暴袭击考艾岛的飓风伊瓦是证明了这一规则的可怕例外。）一周前，当我看到飓风时多拉仍在积蓄力量，正像一场怪物风暴一样穿过群岛以南数百英里，我默默祈祷道谢，然后很快就忘记了这件事。夏威夷是晴朗的。但就像其他地方一样，它一直是透明的，直到突然之间就变得不透明了。这是夏威夷人们不断互相问的问题：飓风从什么时候开始引发野火？<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/07/climate-change-damage-displacement-solastalgia/670614/">阅读：气候变化时代创造了新的情感</a><br><br>加州人讨厌人们被火烧晕。今年夏天早些时候，我是东海岸众多野火新手之一，当时天空变成了橙色，清晨的阳光投下傍晚的阴影，整个城市闻起来像篝火。这只是因为从加拿大飘来的烟雾。尽管如此，这次经历对我来说仍然是一种新的世界末日。 <i>“我们已经这样生活了很多年</i>，”加州人抱怨道。<i>我们告诉过你它也会为你而来。</i>当然，他们是对的。我希望他们没有。<br><br>我们生活在一个充满太多情感、太多表演性反应、太多确定性和太多悲观主义的时代。所有这些互相喊叫的结果是淹没了真正值得关注和关心的事情，更不用说它如何损害了我们团结起来解决生存问题的能力。而且——这是人类韧性和适应性的副产品，这些品质本来对我们很有帮助——有时从理智上理解一种现象是不够的；这与当火焰舔舐自家门时所得到的视角不同。<br><br>群岛上的人们内心深处都知道夏威夷与美国其他地区不同。你可以欺骗自己，认为这会以某种方式保护它免受在该国或世界其他地方遭受苦难的侮辱。 （顺便说一句， <i>La&#39;a Maomao 的</i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wehewehe.org/">字面意思</a>是“神圣的距离” <i>。</i> ）有时这种魔力确实有效。然而，这一次却没有。在不久的将来，某个时候太快了，另一个地方将再次发自内心地感受到我们多年来已经在智力上吸收的知识——我们已经没有时间来保护自己了，当美丽的东西燃烧时，你永远无法真正把它拿回来。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 10 Aug 2023 17:33:46 GMT</pubDate><guid

“我们 48 小时内不会直接隔着穿孔墙进行互动，”洛基告诉我。<br><br> A giant playpen outfitted with toys, air samplers, and video cameras isn&#39;t exactly a <em>natural</em> habitat for a ferret. But the setup does tap into many of the animals&#39; impish instincts. Domesticated by humans over thousands of years, ferrets “are a very playful species, and they love to be social,” says Alice Dancer, an animal-welfare researcher at the University of London&#39;s Royal Veterinary College. That makes them great models for not just flu transmission, but flu transmission among <em>kids</em> , who are thought to be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4469206/">major</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2939723/">drivers</a> of outbreaks <em>.</em> In their day care, the ferrets squabble over toys, clamber up play structures, and canoodle plush snakes; they chase one another around, and nap in big piles when they get tuckered out; they exchange affectionate nuzzles, bonks, and little play bites. Every interaction represents a potential transmission event; so, too, do the surfaces they touch, and the shared pockets of air from which they all breathe.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/04/yamagata-flu-transmission-lineage-extinction/673662/">Read: The flu may never be the same</a><br><br> Already, the researchers have collected some results that, Lakdawala told me, are “changing the way I think about transmission a little bit.” In one early experiment, involving an infected animal cavorting with four uninfected ones, they were surprised to find that the ferret with the <em>least</em> direct contact with the flu “donor” was the only “recipient” in the room who got sick. It seemed counterintuitive, Lakdawala told me, until video footage revealed that the newly sickened recipient had been copying everything that the donor did—chewing the toys it chewed, rolling the balls it rolled, swiping the surfaces it swiped. It was as if the first ferret was leaving a trail of infectious breadcrumbs for the second one to snarf. If that finding holds up in other experiments, which the researchers are analyzing now, it could suggest that contaminated surfaces, or fomites, are playing a larger-than-expected role in passing the virus around, Rockey told me.<br><br> Another of the team&#39;s early findings points to a similar notion. When the researchers cranked up the ventilation in their ferret day cares, hoping to clear virus particles out of the air, they found that the same proportion of uninfected ferrets ended up catching the virus. This was disappointing, but not a total shock given how paws-on ferrets—and kids, for that matter—are with one another and their surroundings. It didn&#39;t matter if the air in the room was being exchanged more than once every three minutes. Whenever the ferrets had their run of the room, the researchers would find virus particles smeared on the toys, the snack station, and the playpen walls.<br><br> Ventilation wasn&#39;t totally useless: More air exchanges, the team found, did seem to reduce the concentration of flu genetic material in the air, and the ferrets who got infected under those conditions were slower to start <em>shedding</em> the virus—a hint, Lakdawala thinks, that they might have taken in a lower infectious dose. Among humans, that might translate into less severe cases of disease, Gordon told me, though that would need to be confirmed.<br><br> Whatever upshots Rockey and Lakdawala&#39;s ferret findings might have for human day cares won&#39;t necessarily apply to other venues. In offices, hospitals, and even schools for older kids, people are generally a lot less tactile with one another, and a lot better versed on hygiene. Plus, adult bodies just aren&#39;t built like kids&#39;, says Cécile Viboud, an epidemiologist at the Fogarty International Center at the National Institutes of Health. Their <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8014227/">airways</a> are bigger, stronger, and more <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8721651/">developed</a> —and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2021830118">some experiments</a> suggest that, for at least some respiratory viruses, the older and larger people are, the more infectious aerosols they might expel. For adults, ventilation may matter all the more.<br><br> Lakdawala and her colleagues are still mulling some other interventions that might work better for ferrets, and eventually kids: humidifiers, air purifiers, targeted cleaning, maybe even keeping individuals from crowding too closely into a portion of the playpen. (They don&#39;t plan to experiment with handwashing or masking; imagine the difficulty of strapping an N95 to a ferret&#39;s face.) Lakdawala is also mulling whether surfaces made of copper—which her team has shown can <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37404191/">render flu viruses inactive within minutes</a> —could play a protective role.<br><br> But everything that happens in the ferrets&#39; playpens will still come with caveats. “It&#39;s still an animal model, at the end of the day,” Viboud told me. For all the similarities between the ferret airway and ours, the way their little noses and snouts are shaped could affect how they cough and sneeze. And the researchers haven&#39;t yet studied spread among ferrets with preexisting immunity to flu, which some day-care attendees will have. Ferrets are also more inclined to bite, wrestle, and defecate wherever they please than the average (potty-trained) kid.<br><br> Still, for the most part, Lakdawala delights in how childlike the ferrets can be. They&#39;re affectionate and mischievous; they seem to bubble with energy and glee. After discovering that the air-sampling robot stationed in the center of their day care was mobile, several of the ferrets began to take it for rides. In watching and sharing the footage at conferences, Lakdawala has received one piece of feedback, over and over again: <em>Oh yeah</em> , parents tell her. <em>My kids do that too.</em><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 10 Aug 2023 17:16:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/day-care-ferret-flu-transmission-research/674972/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/day-care-ferret-flu-transmission-research/674972/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Political Rom-Com That Feels Ripped From a Bygone Era]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Prime Video&#39;s <em>Red, White &amp; Royal Blue</em> is an escapist fantasy that can&#39;t quite escape the real world, no matter how hard it tries. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/EMJnjuYnCfFr4SEYAeqpEtcwCoE=/0x0:3000x1688/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/12676351_212db3f560ee45d19a9afc5cf419cc21_master_3000/original.jpg" alt="A still from Prime Video’s “Red, White &amp; Royal Blue”" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Jonathan Prime / Amazon Studios</figcaption></figure> Of all the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/12/kerry.concert/index.html">politics</a> - <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wired.com/2004/08/rock-the-vote-goes-im/">adjacent</a> pop culture to come out of 2004, one of the uncanniest coincidences was the release of the two separate major-studio films about the rebellious teenage daughter of a fictional president. In January of that year, <em>Chasing Liberty</em> followed Anna Foster (played by Mandy Moore) on a trip to Europe, where she maneuvered out of her father&#39;s clutches and into the arms of an undercover Secret Service agent. And <em>First Daughter</em> , released that September, followed Sam MacKenzie (Katie Holmes) to her first semester of college in California, where she, too, maneuvered out of her father&#39;s clutches and into the arms of an undercover Secret Service agent.<br><br> The late 1990s and early 2000s were a boom period for this type of frothy romantic comedy, set in a real-world political context without much real-world politics. In <em>Chasing Liberty</em> , <em>First Daughter</em> , and the 1998 made-for-TV classic, <em>My Date With the President&#39;s Daughter</em> , the demands of the presidency serve mostly as a justification for the fathers&#39; heightened protectiveness over their teenage girls. And in movies about overseas royalty, like <em>The Princess Diaries</em> and <em>The Prince &amp; Me</em> , the revelation that a character is part of the monarchy mostly focuses on the interpersonal fallout. These movies&#39; sanguine approach to politics is part of their appeal. They feel like interchangeable entrants in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://collider.com/disney-channel-original-movies-golden-era/">a Disney Channel cinematic universe</a> where a political problem, if it ever exists, can be solved by some headstrong teen just opening up to their hardworking single parent—who, it turns out, happens to be the president of the United States.<br><br> <em>Red, White &amp; Royal Blue</em> , a new film streaming on Prime Video, takes inspiration from that bygone era of schmaltzy politics-adjacent rom-coms—with some notable twists. The film&#39;s protagonist is the first son of the United States—a biracial, bisexual college student named Alexander Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez), who falls hard for Prince Henry Fox-Mountchristen-Windsor of Wales (Nicholas Galitzine) after the two are forced to fake a friendship to preserve diplomatic relations between the United States and the United Kingdom. As an odd-couple romantic comedy, it&#39;s earnest and easily watchable meme fodder that riffs on the classic enemies-to-lovers trope. And unlike some of its predecessors, it attempts to meaningfully situate its love story within the high-stakes arena of contemporary politics. But its cheery fantasy—of youthful antics playing out against an adult backdrop of responsible governance—feels progressively more false and, in the current moment of geopolitical turmoil, lands somewhat uncomfortably.<br><br> Directed by Matthew López, who co-wrote the script with Ted Malawer, <em>Red, White &amp; Royal Blue</em> is an adaptation of the author Casey McQuiston&#39;s 2019 novel. When it was published, the book quickly gained fans across social media, and on the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/02/sex-intimacy-love-scenes-tv-movies-humanity-expression/673140/">romance-obsessed</a> , best-seller-fueling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/red-white-royal-blue-book-summer-beach-read-11565285001">virality machine known as BookTok</a> . It&#39;s not hard to see why the book won over readers: McQuiston started writing the novel during the 2016 presidential election, when the idea of a woman leading the nation seemed just within reach. After the shock of Donald Trump&#39;s election, McQuiston&#39;s book—set in an alternate timeline where a woman <em>did</em> win in 2016—became an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/unthinking-pleasure-on-casey-mcquistons-red-white-royal-blue/">escapist thrill for readers</a> , especially those who, like the author, are queer. In the upside-down world of <em>Red, White &amp; Royal Blue</em> , gay sex is plentiful and homophobia is widely condemned. Alex isn&#39;t just a regular kid with a mom who supports him as a young queer person; he is the son of a Texas Democrat whose public embrace of her child helps her clinch reelection by turning her home state blue.<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2022/02/can-rom-coms-make-a-comeback/622868/">Read: America needs a rom-com bailout</a><br><br> Throughout their lustful and heady courtship, Alex and Henry teach each other about life on either side of the pond; it&#39;s sort of what <em>Hamilton</em> might feel like if it were a contemporary queer romance green-lighted by Archewell, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle&#39;s production company. “In America, if you&#39;re an immigrant with a Z in your last name, there&#39;s not a lot of people in positions of power that look like you or sound like you,” Alex tells Henry in bed one morning. “I&#39;ve been given a chance to be someone in the world that my father didn&#39;t see when he was growing up.” In the role of President Ellen Claremont, Uma Thurman acts as a clear stand-in for the lean-in leadership that many Americans voted for in 2016: She&#39;s an accomplished, self-assured career woman who was first elected to political office at 27, and takes cues from her diverse staffers during her reelection campaign. The electoral map is competitive, we&#39;re led to believe, but it&#39;s not unfair. Not only can a white woman from Texas win two presidential elections, but she can do so alongside her Mexican American husband and their biracial children.<br><br> Still, <em>Red, White &amp; Royal Blue</em> can&#39;t help but brush up against the limitations of this type of narrative in a post-Trump, post–January 6 world. The movie enters a political climate in which two-party governance is no longer a steady electoral system, and national politicians openly advocate for violence against rivals.

Because liberal Britons know this is unfair and untrue. Or rather, it is unfair and untrue with one extraordinary exception: the British honors system, the customary practice of awarding medals and titles to citizens.<br><br> This exception of ancient privilege has helped create a summer of misery for the British government and its newish prime minister, Rishi Sunak. It is a saga both funny and slightly shaming.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">lmost all countries</span> have honors systems—public virtue is rarely its own reward. Every year, some 2,000 Britons <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wearebayleaf.com/kings-honours-statistics/">are recipients</a> of one level of honor or another (Italy and France dish out more). Like several of our invented traditions, the British honors system stretches back only as far as the early years of the 20th century. During this tumultuous period—when organized labor was on the march, the Irish wanted Home Rule, and suffragettes were breaking windows—the ruling class was necessarily at its most resourceful in finding ways of cementing the people to the state.<br><br> Accordingly, the Order of the British Empire was established in 1917, as a way of decorating the king&#39;s subjects for noncombat services during the Great War. Imperial associations aside, the award is quite harmless. All of those honored have the excitement of going to a royal palace to receive their medal from the monarch or a member of the Royal Family. They then have the cachet of using the title in their formal address; tables in otherwise booked-out restaurants are suddenly found for lords and knights. Photographs of the awardee meeting royalty appear on study walls—and everyone thus blessed gets to have a story about how the late Queen smiled at them or how Charles laughed at their jokes. Notoriously, rebellious actors become royalists overnight.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1863/08/an-american-in-the-house-of-lords/627956/">From the August 1863 issue: An American in the House of Lords</a><br><br> This part of the honors system is surprisingly democratic—or at least no less benign than belonging to a Rotary Club, say. Anyone can nominate someone, even themselves. The nominations are collected, sifted into categories, and whittled down by civil servants into short lists that are presented to committees of the great and good from relevant areas of public life: science and technology, culture and the arts, the charity sector, and so on. The vetting is no doubt thorough and in good faith, but this being Britain, a degree of possibly envious cynicism is sometimes heard—about an Order of the British Empire, or OBE, being awarded for Other Buggers&#39; Efforts.<br><br> I recently met a woman member of the House of Lords who was emailed out of the blue by someone applying for an honor; they asked if she might provide a reference. “But I&#39;ve never heard of you,” she objected. “Oh, that&#39;s all right,” the emailer replied. “I&#39;ll take you to lunch, and we can get to know each other.”<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he OBEs are not</span> the side of the honors system that&#39;s been causing trouble. Nor even are the more prestigious knighthoods. To be knighted might not strike one as a natural way for a democracy to demonstrate its socially inclusive, multicultural values, but in the past couple of years, two of my friends have been knighted: One is Black, and the other is gay. Both naturally professed a slight embarrassment, but this was offset by the pleasure their elderly relatives supposedly took in the award.<br><br> The problem lies in the peerages. To be “ennobled” and become a member of the House of Lords is simultaneously to be honored and to be appointed to the legislature of the United Kingdom. A lord or lady not only gets the best restaurant reservations, but also sits in the Palace of Westminster and holds a significant degree of political sway, the House of Lords being the deliberative second chamber to the elected House of Commons. Much as the House of Representatives and the Senate form the US Congress, the UK&#39;s two chambers form Parliament—with the important difference that, unlike the Lords, the US Senate is an elected body. Although the initiative in lawmaking belongs to the Commons, the Lords nevertheless wields influence by debating, revising, and ratifying legislative proposals.<br><br> Once elevated to the leather-upholstered benches of the Lords chamber, you can join the 90 or so hereditary peers (dukes, marquesses, earls, viscounts) left over from an uncompleted reform during the Tony Blair years, and the two dozen bishops of the Church of England, including the archbishop of Canterbury. Hereditary peerages are rarely created; nearly 40 years have passed since the previous three. But peers for life (their title nonheritable) are made all the time—and whoever gets to nominate people for the House of Lords thus exercises considerable powers of patronage. Peers, like the members of the US Supreme Court, sit for life.<br><br> Lord-making usually happens twice a year, in a New Year&#39;s honors list and in the monarch&#39;s birthday honors list. In practice, the prime minister of the day comes up with a collection of people he or she wants ennobled, including, by convention, some nominees from the opposition parties and a few others put forward by the civil service. These nominees are then checked for wholesomeness by an independent committee.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/08/britain-lords-canada-senate-scandal/402125/">Read: A tale of two legislative chambers</a><br><br> In addition, however, is another list that follows the calling of a general election: the so-called dissolution list, which features politicians who are retiring from the House of Commons and might have some residual usefulness. Finally, and most poisonously, there is the list granted to an outgoing prime minister. This one is hard to describe as anything other than a way of rewarding old comrades and close cronies.<br><br> E <span class="smallcaps">nter—or rather, exit</span> —Boris Johnson. Even before he quit as prime minister last summer, Johnson created characteristic mayhem by using honors lists to elevate obviously unsuitable people to the Lords. In 2020, against the advice of the MI5 security service, he controversially raised to the peerage Evgeny Lebedev, the newspaper-owning son of a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/13/world/europe/uk-oligarchs-russia-ukraine.html">Russian oligarch and former KGB officer</a> .

Blair didn&#39;t; nor did Gordon Brown. Johnson, however, put forward the names of at least <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2023/jun/11/boris-johnson-peerages-honours-list-row">16 people to become peers</a> . Some were young, underqualified former aides; a number had been implicated in the “Partygate” scandals during the pandemic lockdown, the issue most responsible for the public&#39;s loss of confidence in Johnson; and four of them were sitting Conservative MPs, loyal to Johnson.<br><br> The immediate problem with the last category, aside from the appearance of cronyism, was a straightforwardly political one: To take up their peerages, these parliamentarians would have to resign their Commons seats, triggering special elections that Sunak&#39;s government, dealing with the mess left by Johnson and his successor, Liz Truss, might easily lose.<br><br> One of these MPs was Nadine Dorries. A combative Liverpudlian from a working-class family, Dorries is an unusual Tory. Well to the right of the party mainstream, Dorries was passed over for government office for 14 years after her first election, in 2005. Only in 2019 was she given a brief as a junior health minister—by Johnson, whom she had supported for the party leadership that year. Before, she was best known for her participation in a reality TV show set in an Australian jungle, where she was obliged to eat a camel&#39;s toe and an ostrich&#39;s anus. She succeeded in parlaying that celebrity into a series of potboiler novels set in 1950s Liverpool. By the time of Johnson&#39;s fall, Dorries had gained cabinet rank as culture minister.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2019/07/boris-johnson-profile/594379/">Read: Boris Johnson meets his destiny</a><br><br> When, last July, Johnson&#39;s senior cabinet colleagues—Sunak included—were abandoning their leader by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9702785/#:~:text=In%20July%202022%2C%20an%20unprecedented,the%20second%20minister%20to%20resign.">resigning</a> and making his position untenable, Dorries stood firm. To some, her defense of her boss spoke of an almost romantic devotion, but he alone in his party had recognized her abilities and rewarded them, where his snobbish predecessors had not.<br><br> So Johnson nominated Dorries for a peerage. But when the final list was published, her name was not on it. “I was born into poverty and clawed my way out of it … and then carved out a role in public service,” a deeply disappointed Dorries <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-12187013/NADINE-DORRIES-sinister-forces-stopped-girl-reaching-House-Lords.html">wrote</a> in the <i>Daily Mail</i> . “A seat in the Lords was recognition of that.” Instead, she went on, “sinister forces conspired against me and have left me heartbroken.”<br><br> Dorries did not name her presumed persecutors, but control over an outgoing prime minister&#39;s honors list ultimately lies with the new incumbent. So for now, she has stayed on as an MP, though she may simply be biding her time for a moment when her resignation and another special election will be maximally inconvenient for Sunak.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he Dorries affair</span> has had an entertaining reality-show vibe, but the sorry business of Johnson&#39;s list has brought renewed scrutiny to a peerage system already fallen into disrepute. And this sense of institutional crisis has only intensified with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/truss-pm-honours-list-one-gong-for-every-four-days-in-no-10-902jx9zqz">the news this week</a> of Truss&#39;s leaving list: Of her four reported nominees for the House of Lords, one was her deputy chief of staff for her 49-day tenure as prime minister, and another was a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/think-tanks-institute-economic-affairs-liz-truss-economy-crash/">think-tank ally who supported</a> the disastrous economic plan that sealed her fate.<br><br> Back in 2021, <i>The Sunday Times</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/new-tory-sleaze-row-as-donors-who-pay-3m-get-seats-in-house-of-lords-2575s6jmp">reported</a> that “in the past two decades, all 16 of the party&#39;s main treasurers … have been offered a seat in the Lords.” One anonymous source even told the newspaper about a donor “who had been enticed into giving £1 million to the party” because that would lead to a peerage. According to a 2022 estimate by <i>The Guardian</i> , nearly a tenth of Conservative peers had donated more than £100,000 ($127,000) to the party.<br><br> The use of peerages for patronage, a phlegmatic constitutional historian wrote some years ago, may be a useful <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmselect/cmpubadm/212/21206.htm">“lubricant”</a> to help a prime minister achieve their objectives. But one consequence of the unchecked practice has been the ballooning membership of the second chamber. As it is, we have to be grateful for the absentees: If all 779 members turned up at once, there&#39;d be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2016/feb/06/who-needs-house-of-lords-meet-peers-rattling-the-commons">no room</a> .<br><br> A second, more serious consequence has been growing public support for reform of the Lords—including <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://theconversation.com/labours-plan-to-abolish-the-house-of-lords-what-exactly-has-been-proposed-and-the-chances-keir-starmer-will-adopt-it-195976">calls for its abolition</a> .

Senior members of the House of Lords worry about the institution&#39;s reputation, and have for some time <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmpubadm/662/662.pdf">argued</a> for reductions in its size and susceptibility to political patronage.<br><br> N <span class="smallcaps">ot long ago</span> , I was invited to a party at the House of Lords thrown for an old friend who had been awarded a major honor—to protect this person&#39;s privacy, let&#39;s call it the Order of the Bedchamber (the honors system furnishes <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.royal.uk/the-order-of-the-garter">stranger antiquarian titles</a> than that, in fact). I do admire this person&#39;s achievements, but I was brought up in a communist family, and so, at this function, I felt a bit like Richard Dawkins at a Quaker meeting: love the people but wonder if they&#39;ve secretly been raiding the drinks cabinet.<br><br> The room at the Palace of Westminster was high-ceilinged, its walls lined with large 18th-century paintings of sea battles, its mullioned windows overlooking the Thames. The physical setting was the perfect embodiment of nostalgia for imperial glory combined with an air of unfit-for-purposeness in the modern world. I remarked on this to a hard-working Labour baroness I know. “It&#39;s why so many of them want to be in the Lords,” she said. “Move out of this place, and half of them would give up their peerages.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/10/almost-noble/308211/">Christopher Hitchens: Almost noble</a><br><br> Moving the legislature out of the Palace of Westminster—which is literally <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.eu/article/palace-westminster-falling-down-british-democracy-house-chamber-lords/">crumbling</a> , with major leaks from its roof and pipes and falling masonry—is what any less hidebound polity would do.

They spend a lot of time and resources searching for the secrets of well-being, like old-time miners prospecting for gold. But for some sages throughout history, this is the wrong approach. Happiness isn&#39;t something to be <i>found</i> ; it&#39;s something to <i>attract</i> .<br><br> Perhaps the most famous proponent of the second path was the Greek philosopher Aristotle. He defined happiness as <i>eudaemonia</i> , which means “good spirit.” To us moderns, this might sound vaporous, like the superficial happy feelings that so many people (incorrectly, in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/11/finding-happiness-and-meaning-in-politically-divided-america/672130/">my view</a> ) chase. Instead, the philosopher meant that happiness was a divine state that would visit each of us as it pleased. Our only responsibility was to open the door to it. And we do so by living well.<br><br> To live well, we should practice specific virtues and make them into habits. As Aristotle <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9">wrote</a> in his <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> , “If it is better to be happy as a result of one&#39;s own exertions than by the gift of fortune, it is reasonable to suppose that this is how happiness is won.” Here are 10 of the virtues he recommends—which, as modern research shows, do generally attract the good spirit.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C.

Whether he would recognize the virtue in our modern settings is hard to guess—who knows what he would say about the fear of being canceled on social media? But the question at hand is not the source of fear but whether courage—to act in the face of fear rather than give in to it—invites happiness. And the research suggests that it does: Scholars have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259778922_Biological_contributions_to_well-being_The_relationships_amongst_temperament_character_strengths_and_resilience">shown</a> that courage can lead to resilience after adversity, and resilience <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-07991-007">leads</a> to greater happiness.<br><br> <b>2.</b><b> </b><b>Temperance</b><br> By this, the philosopher means self-control in the face of one&#39;s appetites and base impulses. He would classify the hippie motto “If it feels good, do it!” as a recipe for misery. Modern researchers investigating self-control agree, but with a twist. Scholars writing in the <i>Journal of Personality</i> in 2017 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12322?casa_token=xFX0iDLDuiQAAAAA%3AfPL8aHFxVyoSerYzXI9M4aTRzOK-q_SMOPXPgMgGf9gzupRILN3uZvR-ZMakYB2hPOk1F9PnepszUL0">found</a> that as impulse control among college students increased over the course of a day, positive affect initially <i>fell</i> . As self-control kept rising, however, negative feelings decreased; happiness rose to its highest levels when self-control was at its highest as well. In other words, a little moderation isn&#39;t so good for well-being, but immoderate moderation may be great.<br><br> <b>3.</b><b> </b><b>Liberality</b><br> By this, the philosopher is referring not to politics (liberal <i>ism</i> ) but to money. Specifically, he recommends avoiding stinginess but without being profligate. In fact, evidence suggests that being a cheapskate influences your well-being. For example, three economists in 2014 set up an ultimatum-bargaining game in which participants had to split a certain amount of money: One participant offered a certain split; the other could say yes or no, but <i>no</i> meant that neither side got anything, so the offer of a lousy split could be answered with spite. The authors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108218">found</a> that physical stress levels were higher for both parties when the bargaining involved offered a split lower than 40 percent.<br><br> <b>4.</b><b> </b><b>Magnificence</b><br> Related to liberality is what Aristotle <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-nicomachean_ethics/1926/pb_LCL073.207.xml">calls</a> “magnificence,” according to which a person “will think how he can carry out his project most nobly and splendidly, rather than how much it will cost and how it can be done most cheaply.” He was not asserting here that the path to happiness is to buy an ostentatious yacht; rather, magnificence <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://philarchive.org/archive/ATHADO">means</a> giving to projects that benefit a large number of people. Today, we might call this “munificence”—to be as philanthropic as you reasonably can be. For this, the support is unambiguous: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.journalppw.com/index.php/jpsp/article/view/4535">Giving feels good</a> .<br><br> <b>5.</b><b> </b><b>Greatness of soul</b><br> A great-souled person, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0002.002/--modern-greatness-of-soul-in-hume-and-smith?rgn=main;view=fulltext">according</a> to Aristotle, acts like his close predecessor in ancient Greek philosophy, Socrates, who was a “being indifferent to good and bad fortune.” This requires being high-minded—not that you can&#39;t tell the difference between pleasant and unpleasant things, but that you are occupied by what is deeper and more meaningful in life than transitory pleasures and passing irritations. Indeed, research comparing the pursuit of pleasure versus of meaning among adolescents <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Linting-Zhang/publication/364186853_Pursuing_Pleasure_or_Meaning_A_Cross-Lagged_Analysis_of_Happiness_Motives_and_Well-being_in_Adolescents/links/6353a4656e0d367d91b4a52e/Pursuing-Pleasure-or-Meaning-A-Cross-Lagged-Analysis-of-Happiness-Motives-and-Well-being-in-Adolescents.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&amp;_sg%5B1%5D=started_experiment_milestone&amp;origin=journalDetail&amp;_rtd=e30%3D">shows</a> that the latter leads to greater happiness.

The idea is that to be self-possessed in this way brings happiness. If true, then gentleness&#39;s opposite, aggression, should lower well-being by making it harder to manage one&#39;s own emotions. Researchers have tested this idea by asking people to think of someone they despise, and then either to imagine violent, malicious actions toward the person or to focus on a neutral thought (specifically, what they planned to do the following Wednesday—presumably <i>not</i> beat up the person in question). They <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260518812796?journalCode=jiva">found</a> that the aggressive thinkers began to brood over their fantasy assault and experienced lower well-being than the temperate crew as a result.<br><br> <b>7.</b><b> </b><b>Truthfulness about yourself</b><br> Aristotle put a great premium on honesty. He counseled against “pretense in the form of exaggeration” and boastfulness, but also against self-deprecation. You might say he recommended that we seek something like secure humility, through which we recognize ourselves and can show others who we are without either puffery or self-denigration. This tracks with the general work on humility, which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lisa-Ross-4/publication/357425333_Humility_Personality_and_Psychological_Functioning/links/6238bf09781d2e6df7ab6792/Humility-Personality-and-Psychological-Functioning.pdf">correlates</a> with lower levels of neuroticism and depression, as well as with a greater love of life. But it is also consistent with research <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760801999461">showing</a> that insecurity and excessive self-criticism are associated with anxiety and sadness.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/when-philosophy-becomes-therapy/380531/">Read: When philosophy becomes therapy</a><br><br> <b>8.</b><b> </b><b>公平</b><br>This is a word that gets a lot of attention in our modern debates. It commonly involves efforts to increase fairness and to redress past discrimination. And it is manifestly true that when people believe they are being treated unfairly, it <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797611417262">lowers their happiness</a> . But Aristotle meant something totally different. “The equitable man,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D10">wrote</a> the philosopher, “is one who by choice and habit … does not stand on his rights unduly, but is content to receive a smaller share although he has the law on his side.” He called this “a special kind of Justice.” For this proposition, I can find no specific empirical evidence. However, it is almost certainly related to the next virtue.<br><br> <b>9.</b><b> </b><b>饶恕</b><br>Aristotle. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D11">wrote</a> about the virtue of consideration for others. To the contemporary ear, this sounds like politeness, or sensitivity to others&#39; feelings, but the philosopher was recommending something much trickier: forgiveness and forbearance toward others&#39; faults. The wisdom of this advice has a large modern literature to support it. Virtually every study of forgiveness <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://osf.io/8qzgw/">shows</a> that practicing it purposefully and letting go of grievances lowers depression and anxiety symptoms.<br><br> <b>10.</b><b> </b><b>Modesty</b><br> Modesty is often thought in the modern world to resemble humility. But Aristotle defined it as refraining from shameful (if tempting) behavior—and applied this even to private conduct. This conception of modesty makes it similar to temperance, except that instead of moderation in the face of base appetites, we should abstain completely from vices. He added a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0054:book=4:chapter=9&amp;highlight=modesty">caveat</a> , however: Modesty could be a virtue only if “a good man would be ashamed if he were to do so and so.” In other words, you have to believe a certain action is vicious in order to be virtuous in avoiding it. I personally have no moral qualms about liquor but don&#39;t drink myself, so by the Aristotelian standard, my teetotaling is not a virtue. Bearing this caveat in mind, this kind of modesty is indeed a happiness strategy: When people undertake what they consider <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1251560?casa_token=RE8pgoNigLIAAAAA:TcdOOZGDpCbkQbmv_wZgSuAGB-YrCj_FrXPAg7kR4I0-p9wP-Bn3iBHGcMVa1TMHqJvHiauz-0vU">moral acts</a> , they gain in happiness and even more so in sense of purpose; when they commit immoral acts, they experience the opposite.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">ristotle proposed these</span> happiness virtues more than two millennia ago, but I believe they provide a handy checklist today for living well.

Know your appetites and control them.<br> 3. Be neither a cheapskate nor a spendthrift.<br> 4. Give as generously as you can.<br> 5. Focus more on the transcendent; disregard the trivial.<br> 6. True strength is a controlled temper.<br> 7. Never lie, especially to yourself.<br> 8. Stop struggling for your fair share.<br> 9. Forgive others, and forbear their weaknesses.<br> 10. Define your morality; live up to it, even in private.<br><br> None of these rules is easy to follow. It is harder still to make them into habits.

Instead, we stand side by side in the kitchen while I follow her muscle memory, rolling Russian tea cakes in powdered sugar and pressing the bottoms of forks into the dough balls for chocolate crinkle cookies. But my mom is Type A to a <em>t</em> : She&#39;s scanned the pages of step-by-step instructions and keeps them organized on her Google Drive, just in case. And she&#39;s already made sure that, when she dies—whenever that awful day might come—the folder containing all of these recipes will get sent directly to me.<br><br> Technically, the cookie recipes will be part of a larger posthumous digital delivery, arriving in my inbox courtesy of Google&#39;s Inactive Account Manager. They will reach me three months after my mom&#39;s departure—a time frame she selected after doing a regular review of her privacy settings earlier this year (like I said, Type A). With the cookie recipes will come the rest of her Google Drive, containing information including a list of account passwords, and all of her emails. This means there will be a December day when, instead of standing in the kitchen with my mom, I&#39;ll be standing with her digital ghost. I&#39;ll have mourned her physical passing, but will still be able to summon a part of her via my phone, propped up against the flour with one of many smudged and annotated recipe scans on display.<br><br> On this day, I expect I will grieve again. As the author Marisa Renee Lee <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/us-covid-grief-one-million-deaths/629533/">noted</a> in this magazine last year, “Grief is the repeated experience of learning to live after loss.” Today, with our ever-expanding digital and technological reach, loved ones left behind must encounter more reminders of that loss than ever before. Memory endures through the email accounts still collecting marketing messages, the Facebook arguments frozen in time, the iPad that continues to uselessly ping about an overdue library book. Left unattended, these digital assets float aimlessly in the internet&#39;s ether. To have control over them presents the inheritor with a challenging personal quandary: Do they take advantage of the weird comfort these digital remains can provide, sinking into an in-between world where the person who died still feels alive, in small pixelated ways? Or do they shut it all down and accept a second death?<br><br> Estate lawyers have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-social-media-will-an-expert-guide-to-your-digital-afterlife/257112/">long encouraged</a> clients to account for their digital property, but no one has come up with an emotional road map for the burden of inheriting these things. Some logistical matters will only reveal themselves when it&#39;s too late, forcing widows like Ashley Reese to take their grief to the Apple store.<br><br> “I had a weird breakdown,” Reese told me. Her husband, Robert Stengel, died from peritoneal mesothelioma in December at the age of 34. He left behind a comprehensive list of accounts and passwords, and among the things Reese inherited were his AirPods. It was seven months before she felt ready to resurrect his Apple Watch, which she brought to the Apple store for troubleshooting. An employee told her she was wearing it wrong. “I couldn&#39;t do it,” she recalled. “I&#39;m just like, &#39;I&#39;m sorry, this is not mine; it&#39;s my dead husband&#39;s.&#39;”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/10/five-stages-complicated-grief-wrong/671710/">Read: There are no “five stages” of grief</a><br><br> More so than ever before, it is possible for someone to live on through these digital shadows. In addition to holding on to his AirPods and Apple Watch, Reese still keeps her iMessage conversation with Stengel pinned to the top of the Messages app—she once accidentally sent him a text, and tried to unsend it when she realized. When she wants to watch something on Hulu, she can still select his profile. When she opens up YouTube, the algorithm still recommends <em>Succession</em> recaps or fight-scene compilation videos, the things Stengel would be watching if he were alive. When she&#39;s really missing him, she&#39;ll open up his camera roll, and look at one of the last pictures he took—a photo of Reese in his hospital room, unaware that she was being snapped. “This is just psychic damage every day,” she said.<br><br> Lingering in someone&#39;s posthumous digital presence can be as painful as it is comforting, and comes with unexpected revelations. “You don&#39;t want to read too much,” Marie, a woman whose mother died from ovarian cancer last fall, told me. (Marie asked to withhold her last name in order to speak about her family.) Her mom was proactive about her end-of-life plans, going so far as to order her own headstone before she died. She left Marie with her phone, and a list of passwords for all of her accounts. Looking through the device in the days after her mother&#39;s death, Marie found a text thread where her mom had been venting to a friend about a fight they&#39;d had. Marie discovered a Twitter account that her mom had apparently used to spar with right-wingers online—Marie had always thought her mother was as conservative as these opponents. Her Spotify was also revealing: “She listened to so much Taylor Swift, and I had no idea she liked Taylor Swift.”<br><br> Family and friends, themselves grieving, will send text messages to Marie&#39;s mother&#39;s phone. They say they miss her, hoping the sentiment somehow reaches her in the great beyond. Marie reads them. “It&#39;s a nice reminder that she was important to people,” she told me. To know her mother lives on in the thoughts and memories of others is a comfort, one she can now easily access through a screen. Technology like this, which can document a previously intangible part of a person&#39;s legacy, is a gift. It&#39;s also extremely fragile.<br><br> Websites shut down, accounts get hacked, devices break. It&#39;s not safe to assume that direct-message conversations and other social-media memories will be there forever. “My current plan is to just try to do as many digital copies of things as possible,” Reese told me. She has 10 years&#39; worth of messages with Stengel, and plans to back them up on her computer, in Google Drive, and to her iCloud. “I would be absolutely devastated if I lost that stuff.”<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/how-to-talk-about-grief-support/673232/">Read: What losing two children taught me about grief</a><br><br> At the same time, these digital spaces can help combat another inevitability: that, as the months go by, Reese will start to forget. “I have this compulsion now where if I have any thought about Rob or any memory, I&#39;ll immediately open my Notes app and write it down,” she said, “to remind myself of who I was and who he was, and make sure all those [memories] are intact.”<br><br> It&#39;s tempting not to think about death, choosing instead to be walloped by grief&#39;s right hook one day out of nowhere. Even when my mom let me know about the plans for her Google account, fearing I&#39;d receive an email notification and panic, she didn&#39;t use the word <em>dead</em> . We both knew what she meant, though, and now that I know what awaits me, the records of our digital interactions have more meaning. The Wordle scores texted back and forth, the DMs about our favorite Instagram-famous dog, even the hokey e-cards we still send each other on holidays—these things no longer feel like just more clutter in a digital abyss.

I will not forget one night when I stood on a balcony in suburban Sydney, and every wakeful creature in the surrounding bushland abruptly froze. Even the frogs seemed to want to renounce their noisy bodies. <i>Who goes there?</i> Seconds later, a powerful owl (the name of a species native to Australia) dropped onto the railing, and I, too, nearly leaped out of my skin. The owl was the size of a terrier, but languidly buoyant in the way of a day-old Mylar balloon, and to my ears silent. In the pin-drop quiet, it bounced along the balustrade. I never heard its talons touch the metal. The owl itself, I knew, had such sharp hearing that it could make out a possum&#39;s heart pounding beneath its fur. Unseen, a second owl—mate to the first, I presumed—loosed a deep, woodwind hoot that carried.<br><br> Owl calls often seem ghostlike or inchoate. A twofold sorcery: Owls can lead us to doubt our own faculties while drawing us to wonder at the mysteries of theirs. Of some 260 owl species at large in the night, at dusk, and less commonly during daylight, many are stealthily camouflaged and decked out with decibel-dampening feathers, their shrieks floating without clear origin. The young of some of those species have long been practicing. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/nyregion/lord-of-the-winter.html">Great horned owls</a> find their voice while they are still doubled over in the dark of their moon-shaped egg. Having punctured the small air cell inside the egg&#39;s membrane with their budding beak, the proto-owlets inflate their lungs and start chittering. To each its private void, in a confinement growing tighter the bigger they get. If a spectral sound is supposed to come from beyond the grave, what word might characterize the babble of embryonic life, the noises of beings too tenuous to out themselves from their shell?<br><br> Owls&#39; otherworldly aura—their keening more an atmosphere than an animal sound—has engendered human superstition: What better shorthand for sinister happenings than their ethereal calls? And yet owls have inspired an altogether different response as well. In antiquity, they were sometimes identified as “human-headed birds.” Their domed head, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/how-owls-twist-heads-almost-360-degrees">wide-set eye sockets</a> (enabling binocular vision), and flat facial profile—distinctive within their biological class—are features that map onto a human visage. Whether the mythic depiction of owls as thoughtful, even philosophical, beings stemmed from this semblance alone, who can say?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/what-the-crow-knows/580726/">From the March 2019 issue: A journey into the animal mind</a><br><br> Perhaps the inference arose instead from an understanding of owls as active at the close of the customary workday, after nightfall, hours that offer the chance for repose and contemplation. Or perhaps owls&#39; sensitivity to stimuli beyond human ken suggested unfathomed know-how, a shrewd intelligence needed to navigate the dark. Either way, the sagacity of owls has long stood as a categorical anomaly in a world in which to be called “birdbrained” remains an insult.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Whether feared or revered</span> , owls have lately invited scrutiny by science writers and ornithologists eager to explain the birds&#39; acute perceptiveness, their far-flung environments (Antarctica is the only continent where you won&#39;t find owls), and the relationships between the two. In her 2016 best seller, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-hidden-lives-of-owls-the-science-and-spirit-of-nature-s-most-elusive-birds-leigh-calvez/9781632170255?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Hidden Lives of Owls: The Science and Spirit of Nature&#39;s Most Elusive Birds</i></a> , Leigh Calvez focuses on the owls of the Pacific Northwest, sharing her suspenseful nighttime explorations of the biology and behavior of birds ranging in size from the saw-whet owl, which can fit in a teacup, to the imposing great grey owl (known to some as the “Phantom of the North”). The conservationist Jonathan C. Slaght has devoted decades to learning about Blakiston&#39;s fish owl, “a fire hydrant with a six-foot wingspan,” as he puts it. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/owls-of-the-eastern-ice-a-quest-to-find-and-save-the-world-s-largest-owl-jonathan-c-slaght/9781250798718?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Owls of the Eastern Ice: A Quest to Find and Save the World&#39;s Largest Owl</i></a> (2020), Slaght yokes science to macho adventure in order to track the “floppy goblin” with electric-yellow eyes into the ice-strewn Primorye region of eastern Russia—a shrinking habitat, as are the owl&#39;s hunting grounds in the waters and riverbanks of some of the coldest tributaries in Japan.<br><br> Two new entries in the owl quest find closer kinship between bird and human, yet remain wary of domesticating the dark&#39;s inhabitants too much.

She has in mind the owl of meme culture, featured in viral YouTube, Tumblr, and TikTok posts; remixed as fan art on Reddit forums; and available as an avatar option in multiplayer video games. Online, owls star as twee, humanoid knockoffs, and could hardly be further from their cryptic counterparts heard caterwauling in the starlit woods. A tour of the platforms reveals owls peevishly rain-drenched, owls clowning around, powder-puff nestlings pleading for a dangled snack, owls wincing and head-bobbing, owls as the rambunctious companions of domestic pets. The antithesis of otherworldly, these and similarly whimsical, infantilized animal portrayals are, in Darlington&#39;s view, an invitation to rob nature of its vital wildness.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/what-the-octopus-knows/508745/">From the January/February 2017 issue: What the octopus knows</a><br><br> Yet her project to preserve owl awe doesn&#39;t stop her from recruiting the birds to therapeutic ends. Darlington&#39;s adult son falls ill, and the narrative of his diagnosis and treatment (a “perma-drone of worries”) fastens itself to her journey into the insomniac sphere of owls in a season of family crisis. Midway between divesting owls of adorability and asserting their status as a marvel of nature, Darlington finds they have a role to play as her own personal gargoyles: They serve as forbidding beings that externalize the author&#39;s anxieties, helping her to either wing those fears away or confront them.<br><br> The deftness of owls&#39; senses might be regarded as “its own breed of genius.”<br><br> Jennifer Ackerman, internationally beloved by birders as the author of two popular books about avian intelligence— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-bird-way-a-new-look-at-how-birds-talk-work-play-parent-and-think-jennifer-ackerman/9780735223035?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Bird Way: A New Look at How Birds Talk, Work, Play, Parent, and Think</i></a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-genius-of-birds-jennifer-ackerman/9780399563126?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Genius of Birds</i></a> —supplies a more hardheaded assessment of owls, as well as of owl worship, in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/what-an-owl-knows-the-new-science-of-the-world-s-most-enigmatic-birds-jennifer-ackerman/9780593298886?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>What an Owl Knows: The New Science of the World&#39;s Most Enigmatic Birds</i></a> . She locates her owls in the vacant lots of suburban Maringá, in southern Brazil; aloft in hawthorn and chokecherry forests in western Montana; in rehab for roadside injuries in Minnesota; in a limestone quarry in Maastricht, a municipality of the Netherlands. Her investigations lead her to question: How smart are owls, really, and why have they come to stand for the supernatural solemnity of a world beyond us?<br><br> As Ackerman has previously relayed, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bird-brains-are-far-more-humanlike-than-once-thought/">startling findings have emerged</a> from the study of ornithological cognition over the past two decades. Researchers have discovered that, despite the lack of a layered cerebral cortex, the brains of several avian lineages permit complex feats of memory, logic, recognition, even math. Populations of corvids (crows, rooks, ravens, kindred others) are today famed for tool use, problem-solving, and seemingly ritual responses to their dead. American crows will congregate in cawing mobs around the lifeless bodies of birds of their same species, and later avoid food found in the area. Pinyon jays can remember each of a thousand spots where they once stashed a seed. European magpies pass the mirror test: They can recognize themselves as individuals. Some parrots&#39; language facility far exceeds mimicry. When trained in a lab, pigeons—surely the birds most impugned as automatons—turn out to be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/science/pigeons-can-learn-higher-math-as-well-as-monkeys-study-suggests.html">on par with primates</a> in their counting ability (able to order arrays of objects, from a single object, to a pair, to a trio).<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Ackerman wants to know</span> what the latest science says about how owl species stack up against the cleverest birds. In relation to their body size, owls have large brains, an anatomical characteristic thought to have evolved in tandem with “parental provisioning” of offspring. Indeed, owl nestlings hatch before they can hunt or scavenge, dependent on food supplied by adults to provide the energy their brain tissue needs to grow. Yet for the most part, the brainpower of owls is enchained to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/07/light-noise-pollution-animal-sensory-impact/638446/">the activity of their senses</a> , rather than to the sort of intelligence found in birds that display inventiveness, selfhood, superior powers of recall, or numeracy. Some 75 percent of an owl&#39;s cortexlike forebrain is dedicated to hearing and vision, faculties so astounding in range and exactitude that they might seem, to us, a variety of natural magic.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/07/light-noise-pollution-animal-sensory-impact/638446/">From the July/August 2022 issue: How light and noise pollution confound animals&#39; senses</a><br><br> Owl species deemed “eared” or “horned” don&#39;t actually have external ear pinna the way we do, or bony horns like antelope. The flareable tufts of feathers, called “plumicorns,” they sport atop their head might be used to gesture to other owls, or perhaps to help conceal an owl by breaking up its rounded outline, making it appear more like the stump of a rough or broken branch. Though their true ears are mere apertures hidden under their feathers, owls&#39; reactivity to sound has few equivalents in the animal kingdom. The great grey owl can not only pick up the swish of a vole&#39;s footfall coming from a passage cored into a snowbank, but also figure out the elevation of the sound source, so as to strike through the snow and hit that very point. In some owl species, a portion of the hearing nerve branches into the optical lobe of the brain, which scientists speculate could mean that these owls form a visual signal of something heard but out of sight.<br><br> Owls see well in the dimmest conditions, and some species have retained photoreceptor rods that also make them sensitive to ultraviolet light—they are able to see colors that we cannot. Eurasian eagle owls exploit this part of their visual spectrum by having patches of neck plumage that are brightened by reflecting UV light, markings germane to displays of rivalry. Their young also have UV-reflective blotches inside their throat, prominent cues when the eagle owlets gape for food.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">For Ackerman,</span> the deftness of owls&#39; senses might be regarded as “its own breed of genius”—a supremely adaptive gift—though she recognizes that scientists rarely conceive of animal intelligence this way, finding evidence instead in exceptional behavior that conveys some kind of mental nimbleness or surplus. And owls do engage in some types of activity coded as “smart”: Ackerman reports on this repertoire too. Owls are curious about novelty in their environment—one reason they are prone to getting trapped in pipes, hay blowers, and ventilation shafts, which they gamely explore. Little owls can tell groups of people apart, tolerating farmers but fleeing at a glimpse of ornithologists, who catch and band them.<br><br> Though owl faces may seem static, some species flex and refashion the feathered discs around their eyes to reflect states of alertness or relaxation. Owls, especially juvenile ones, play. They also learn: Great horned owls spend about six months with their parents developing dexterities that will aid their survival, including how to fly through tightly set tree canopies, and how to pounce and kill. Compared with adults, young barn owls <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/stuff-dreams-owlets-sleep-human-babies-6c10945743">experience long spells of REM sleep</a> , the part of the sleep cycle associated with vivid and emotion-laden dreams in humans. If barn owlets dream, researchers suspect that those dreams help cement skills they acquire in the twilight, just as, when mice fall into REM sleep, the rodents enter a period of mental processing associated with learning to take cover from birds of prey (among them, owls).<br><br> Indeed, if we get beyond the emblematic wisdom of owls, we might come to recognize their most anthropomorphic quality—their versatility. Owls have unintentionally migrated as stowaways on ships and flourished in new territory. Corridors of agricultural land have facilitated their dispersal too. A few species have acclimatized remarkably well to our architecture and infrastructure, thriving in stables and belfries, occupying dugouts by causeways, roosting by the hundreds in city squares or in cemeteries (where grave sites, laid with edible votives, attract rodents).<br><br> Male burrowing owls have been documented festooning their earthen tunnels with decorative bits of potato, nubs of concrete, corncobs, old gloves, and stolen fabric (red, white, blue, green, in order of preference)—small treasuries underground. Camera traps have also revealed owl food sources to be more diverse than was once thought. They don&#39;t just eat mice, fish, amphibians, and insects, but will also scavenge for carrion, picking meat from dead dolphins and decomposing crocodiles on the shoreline, and stripping quills from the carcasses of crested porcupines to get at the flesh. The largest owl species will hunt other birds (including owls), and go after skunks, fawns, even cats.<br><br> Ultimately, Ackerman concludes that owls do not warrant their storied eminence as recondite knowledge keepers. Nor are they crow-witted by the standards of modern science. Owls are opportunists. When <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/02/flaco-owl-new-york-instinct-learning-hunting/673217/">Flaco, an eagle owl</a> , first escaped from the Central Park Zoo in New York, his flight muscles were not yet strong enough to support flying farther than four blocks, and he bumbled his landings. For a decade he&#39;d lived off hand-cut meat and slaughtered mice.<br><br> Today Flaco hunts his own vermin, and ranges artfully in the north end of Central Park. Bird-watchers praise the preservation of the wildness within him, despite his long captivity. What proves most bewitching about Flaco, described in his zoo days as “pudgy” and “grumpy,” is how swiftly he has freed himself not only from his enclosure but from performative charm. Owls might yet be our alter egos in more than their ability to prosper in a diversity of habitats. What animal more readily accommodates our deep need to swivel between symbolisms, now hooting their summons to our dark and powerful instincts, now strutting and fluffing their appeal to our sense of whimsy?
