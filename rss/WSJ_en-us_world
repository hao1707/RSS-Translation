The strategy paper said that “Russia&#39;s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine has rendered government-to-government cooperation with Russia in the Arctic virtually impossible.”</p><p> The Russian-Chinese partnership heightens the challenges faced by America&#39;s military as it enters a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-china-taiwan-russia-great-power-conflict-481f7756?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">new era of great-power competition</a> . For decades, the US has been focused on fighting insurgencies in the Middle East and Afghanistan, and has lately been working to reorient its forces to face a different type of potential conflict.</p><p> “Both Putin and Xi have made clear that the High North is key to their strategic interests, and it is imperative that the United States and our allies keep them from dominating this region,” said Sen.

Peter Gautier, the US Coast Guard&#39;s head of operations.</p><p> The American public became aware of China&#39;s intelligence-gathering activities near the Arctic earlier this year after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-spy-balloon-over-the-u-s-what-to-know-11675385792?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">a Chinese balloon</a> was first detected near Alaska&#39;s uninhabited St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea. The balloon floated across the US and Canada before it was shot down off the coast of South Carolina.</p><p> China&#39;s foreign ministry denied the balloon was for surveillance and criticized the US for shooting it down.</p><p> Last year, Canadian officials seized Chinese buoys believed to have been involved in surveillance of US submarines, Canadian officials said this year. US officials are also investigating visits by Chinese nationals in and around US bases, including in Alaska.</p><p> “If we&#39;re not there and we allow them to test our waters, it starts to look more like the South China Sea,” said Capt. Stephen Adler, who was then the commander of the Coast Guard Cutter Stratton, on a stop in Dutch Harbor last fall.</p><h3> Expanding trade route</h3><p> The Russia-China security partnership is in part driven by commerce on the energy-rich trade route.</p><p> Warmer temperatures are opening new shipping lanes between Asia and Europe and may eventually introduce brand-new shipping routes near the North Pole. As early as the 2030s, the Arctic may be practically ice-free in September, the month with the lowest amount of ice in the year, according to a June study in Nature Communications.</p><p> Shipping companies are studying Russia&#39;s northern coast as the shortest link between seaports of East Asia and Europe, bypassing southern oceans and the Suez Canal. A cargo ship&#39;s trip from Japan to a port in the Netherlands could be cut by more than half, to less than 6,000 miles from more than 12,000 miles, by traveling through the Arctic Ocean.</p><p> The Northern Sea Route, which Russia asserts the right to regulate under an Arctic agreement, allows ships carrying liquefied natural gas to transport the cargo through the Bering Strait. The route runs along the maritime border between Russian and US waters just west of Alaska.</p><p> More ice-crushing vessels in the area are ferrying Russian gas to the Chinese market. Last year, Russia and China used a trio of massive ice-breaking ships flying Hong Kong flags to carry Russian LNG to Chinese and other markets, according to the AAC SpaceQuest shipping data. The two countries are looking to double shipments of Russian gas to China. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

That move would have violated Russian restrictions on those waters. The documents said Norway supported the US plan, which hasn&#39;t been carried out.</p><p> Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh didn&#39;t comment on the leaked document but said: “The United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as we do around the world.”</p><p> A spokeswoman for the Norwegian Ministry of Defense declined to comment.

Ports such as Dutch Harbor also need improvements.</p><p> A greater US presence in the region is hobbled by a lack of ships hardened to withstand ice. In comparison, Moscow has invested continuously in ice-hardened ships that can steam through water dotted with “growlers”—small frozen chunks.</p><p> The US is lagging behind Russia in true polar icebreakers, which can break through solid ice several feet thick. The massive ships can bring heavy equipment, fuel and supplies through thick sea ice, anywhere from research stations in Antarctica to the North Pole, while also monitoring radio transmissions and shipping and carrying military tools such as helicopters and equipment to cope with accidents or environmental disasters.</p><p> Moscow is looking to increase its large fleet by 2024 with three new “Project 23550” class icebreakers, which are meant to be outfitted with Kalibr cruise missiles. Those icebreakers could travel among a string of new military bases Russia has opened above the Arctic Circle. The bases have also received a fleet of Russia&#39;s Su-34 jet fighters to fly over Arctic waterways.</p><p> Today, the US doesn&#39;t have an icebreaker assigned to the Arctic year round. The Healy, a 16,000-ton diesel behemoth, is the Coast Guard&#39;s longest and biggest ship, but it goes for refitting every winter in Washington state or California. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

In 2020, a fire destroyed one of its two massive electric propulsion motors. The maintenance restricts the US from patrolling the surface of the Arctic for nearly half the year.</p><p> Launched and commissioned in the 1990s, before Putin came to power, the Healy is hardly prepared for military confrontation. The ship is packed with heavy-duty scientific equipment and laboratories, but it has no deck guns to defend itself. The Healy has high-tech communications and a helicopter hangar that have military uses, but its focus is earth science, especially geochemistry and climate studies. A recent set of experiments may help the Navy utilize submersibles under the ice, Capt. Boda said.</p><p> The other US polar icebreaker, the Polar Star, is more powerful than the Healy but is at the end of its useful life and is assigned each year to resupplying scientists in Antarctica. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

That ship operates in the Arctic along with the original Xue Long, meaning “Snow Dragon,” built in Ukraine.</p><p> A year before the Kimball&#39;s encounter with the joint Russian-Chinese squadron, the US Coast Guard&#39;s Stratton spotted one of the ice-breaking Chinese research vessels in the Chukchi Sea, near the US maritime border. The US cutter, which has powerful deck guns and carries a drone, shadowed the Chinese vessel. The reason for tailing the ship, said Adm. Gautier, the Coast Guard&#39;s head of operations, was to “just peacefully exert the fact that there&#39;s US sovereign interests there.”</p><p> China now has the world&#39;s largest navy by size, with the cruiser-destroyers like the Nanchang at the heavily armed vanguard. While the US has a qualitative edge with more-advanced warships, including a larger aircraft-carrier fleet, China is building them more quickly, Vice Adm. Karl Thomas, commander of the US Navy&#39;s Seventh Fleet, said in an interview last year with The Wall Street Journal. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Instead, Beijing&#39;s strategy is to play a supporting role for Russia in the region.</p><h3> Heightened tensions</h3><p> Not since the Cold War have Arctic tensions between the US and Russia been so high.</p><p> In those decades, Russia and members of NATO began monitoring the Arctic, since it was the shortest path for intercontinental missiles and bombers to reach their targets.</p><p> Both sides invested heavily in Arctic facilities, ranging from radar to ice-capable submarines. In the twilight of the Cold War, Soviet and American nuclear submarines collided twice in Arctic waters north of the main Soviet submarine base on Fennoscandia, near the border with Norway, causing damage to the submarines and headaches for diplomats but avoiding a military conflict.</p><p> In 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev signaled a willingness to dial back tensions. He warned in a speech in the Arctic city of Murmansk, Russia, near the submarine base, that the “militarization of this part of the world is assuming threatening dimensions.”</p><p> Three decades later, the seizure of Crimea and the broader invasion of Ukraine have rekindled old tensions, and the US led Western nations to impose a raft of sanctions on Russia&#39;s economy. Western oil and gas giants halted their investment and technology cooperation with Russian firms, especially in technically challenging areas such as the Arctic. On a visit to Nordic countries in June, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the reopening of a Cold War-era diplomatic outpost north of the Arctic Circle in Tromsoe, Norway.</p><p> Moscow has been marginalized in the Tromsoe-based Arctic Council, the regional governing group that includes the US, Canada and other nations with Arctic territory. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sweden-races-to-secure-turkish-support-for-nato-bid-2452c14f?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Sweden and Finland, which long aspired to neutrality, signed up for NATO</a> , and with the expectation that Sweden will complete its membership soon, Russia will be the only Arctic Council voting nation outside the Western military alliance.

The Russian and Chinese ships, which were on a joint exercise, sailed north and east into US waters, sending an unmistakable message about the region&#39;s strategic value to Moscow and Beijing, according to US military officials and national security experts.</p><p> Russian warships and Chinese research vessels aren&#39;t uncommon in a region that includes the Aleutians, a strategic chain of volcanic islands that divides the Pacific Ocean from the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean. They were the location of bitter fighting during World War II. One small island city, Unalaska, which brings in more fish than any other US port, hosts the Coast Guard base at Dutch Harbor.</p><p> “But to see these combatants form up in a surface action group together and steam together, that&#39;s what&#39;s rare,” said Rear Adm.

The strategy paper said that “Russia&#39;s unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine has rendered government-to-government cooperation with Russia in the Arctic virtually impossible.”</p><p> The Russian-Chinese partnership heightens the challenges faced by America&#39;s military as it enters a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-military-china-taiwan-russia-great-power-conflict-481f7756?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">new era of great-power competition</a> . For decades, the US has been focused on fighting insurgencies in the Middle East and Afghanistan, and has lately been working to reorient its forces to face a different type of potential conflict.</p><p> “Both Putin and Xi have made clear that the High North is key to their strategic interests, and it is imperative that the United States and our allies keep them from dominating this region,” said Sen. Roger Wicker (R., Miss.), the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, referring to Russian President <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping.</p><p> Russian-flagged commercial and government vessels active in Arctic waters rose to a monthly average of 709 last year, up 22% since 2018, according to satellite-tracking data compiled by AAC SpaceQuest for The Wall Street Journal. Among the vessels: the 50 Let Pobedy, a 524-foot nuclear icebreaker named for the anniversary of Russia&#39;s World War II victory. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Peter Gautier, the US Coast Guard&#39;s head of operations.</p><p> The American public became aware of China&#39;s intelligence-gathering activities near the Arctic earlier this year after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinese-spy-balloon-over-the-u-s-what-to-know-11675385792?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">a Chinese balloon</a> was first detected near Alaska&#39;s uninhabited St. Matthew Island in the Bering Sea. The balloon floated across the US and Canada before it was shot down off the coast of South Carolina.</p><p> China&#39;s foreign ministry denied the balloon was for surveillance and criticized the US for shooting it down.</p><p> Last year, Canadian officials seized Chinese buoys believed to have been involved in surveillance of US submarines, Canadian officials said this year. US officials are also investigating visits by Chinese nationals in and around US bases, including in Alaska.</p><p> “If we&#39;re not there and we allow them to test our waters, it starts to look more like the South China Sea,” said Capt. Stephen Adler, who was then the commander of the Coast Guard Cutter Stratton, on a stop in Dutch Harbor last fall.</p><h3> Expanding trade route</h3><p> The Russia-China security partnership is in part driven by commerce on the energy-rich trade route.</p><p> Warmer temperatures are opening new shipping lanes between Asia and Europe and may eventually introduce brand-new shipping routes near the North Pole. As early as the 2030s, the Arctic may be practically ice-free in September, the month with the lowest amount of ice in the year, according to a June study in Nature Communications.</p><p> Shipping companies are studying Russia&#39;s northern coast as the shortest link between seaports of East Asia and Europe, bypassing southern oceans and the Suez Canal. A cargo ship&#39;s trip from Japan to a port in the Netherlands could be cut by more than half, to less than 6,000 miles from more than 12,000 miles, by traveling through the Arctic Ocean.</p><p> The Northern Sea Route, which Russia asserts the right to regulate under an Arctic agreement, allows ships carrying liquefied natural gas to transport the cargo through the Bering Strait. The route runs along the maritime border between Russian and US waters just west of Alaska.</p><p> More ice-crushing vessels in the area are ferrying Russian gas to the Chinese market. Last year, Russia and China used a trio of massive ice-breaking ships flying Hong Kong flags to carry Russian LNG to Chinese and other markets, according to the AAC SpaceQuest shipping data. The two countries are looking to double shipments of Russian gas to China. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Such exercises, known as Fonops, involve sailing through waters to contest what the US sees as excessive claims of another nation, including China&#39;s claims in the South China Sea and other areas.</p><p> The US looked at an operation that would have navigated the waters of the Northern Sea Route between Pacific and Atlantic ports via the Arctic waters north of Russia. The document&#39;s authenticity couldn&#39;t be independently verified. The US hasn&#39;t carried out a passage through the route.</p><p> According to another leaked document, the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chill-settles-in-at-a-europe-russia-border-crossing-f5896405?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">US considered conducting an expedition in the Kara Sea</a> , which sits north of Russia, with a NATO warship detachment that was to include as many as four guided-missile destroyers and supply vessels. That move would have violated Russian restrictions on those waters. The documents said Norway supported the US plan, which hasn&#39;t been carried out.</p><p> Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh didn&#39;t comment on the leaked document but said: “The United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows, as we do around the world.”</p><p> A spokeswoman for the Norwegian Ministry of Defense declined to comment. A spokesman for the Russian Embassy in Washington didn&#39;t respond to a request for comment.</p><h3> Combat capabilities</h3><p> While Russia&#39;s vast territory dominates the Arctic coastline, with well-developed ports, airfields and vessels under its control, NATO assets in Canada, Scandinavia and elsewhere in Europe would come into play in any potential conflict.</p><p> The US itself has combat capabilities in the Arctic ranging from air bases in Alaska with more than 100 advanced F-35 and F-22 jets, to nuclear-powered submarines roaming the seas that can punch up through the ice, to missile-tracking radar in Greenland.</p><p> A new Pentagon planner for the region monitors stepped-up exercises in cold conditions, often with allies in the region. In <a href="https://www.europeafrica.army.mil/ArticleViewPressRelease/Article/3296260/news-release-us-forces-in-europe-to-take-part-in-exercise-arctic-forge/" target="_blank" class="icon none">a February exercise</a> , US Army soldiers from the “Arctic Angels” airborne division flew over the North Pole from Alaska to Finland, where they practiced maneuvers with Norwegian troops.</p><p> The frigid deployments are inspiring efforts to deploy unmanned vessels and to innovate for northern fighting forces. Materials scientists are working with the military to improve tools used in icy conditions, for example to prevent frozen spray from accumulating on ships and weapons, a problem previously addressed by a serviceman with a baseball bat. </p><div class="media-object scope-

        </span></p></div></div><p>The biggest gap between Western nations and the Russia-China partnership is in “domain awareness,” or the knowledge of what adversaries are doing in and around a region with few people and little infrastructure.</p><p> Military officers say fixing that involves adding more satellites to provide better communication on the ground, unmanned aircraft and seagoing vessels, and long-range radar. Ports such as Dutch Harbor also need improvements.</p><p> A greater US presence in the region is hobbled by a lack of ships hardened to withstand ice. In comparison, Moscow has invested continuously in ice-hardened ships that can steam through water dotted with “growlers”—small frozen chunks.</p><p> The US is lagging behind Russia in true polar icebreakers, which can break through solid ice several feet thick. The massive ships can bring heavy equipment, fuel and supplies through thick sea ice, anywhere from research stations in Antarctica to the North Pole, while also monitoring radio transmissions and shipping and carrying military tools such as helicopters and equipment to cope with accidents or environmental disasters.</p><p> Moscow is looking to increase its large fleet by 2024 with three new “Project 23550” class icebreakers, which are meant to be outfitted with Kalibr cruise missiles. Those icebreakers could travel among a string of new military bases Russia has opened above the Arctic Circle. The bases have also received a fleet of Russia&#39;s Su-34 jet fighters to fly over Arctic waterways.</p><p> Today, the US doesn&#39;t have an icebreaker assigned to the Arctic year round. The Healy, a 16,000-ton diesel behemoth, is the Coast Guard&#39;s longest and biggest ship, but it goes for refitting every winter in Washington state or California. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

In 2020, a fire destroyed one of its two massive electric propulsion motors. The maintenance restricts the US from patrolling the surface of the Arctic for nearly half the year.</p><p> Launched and commissioned in the 1990s, before Putin came to power, the Healy is hardly prepared for military confrontation. The ship is packed with heavy-duty scientific equipment and laboratories, but it has no deck guns to defend itself. The Healy has high-tech communications and a helicopter hangar that have military uses, but its focus is earth science, especially geochemistry and climate studies. A recent set of experiments may help the Navy utilize submersibles under the ice, Capt. Boda said.</p><p> The other US polar icebreaker, the Polar Star, is more powerful than the Healy but is at the end of its useful life and is assigned each year to resupplying scientists in Antarctica. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

That ship operates in the Arctic along with the original Xue Long, meaning “Snow Dragon,” built in Ukraine.</p><p> A year before the Kimball&#39;s encounter with the joint Russian-Chinese squadron, the US Coast Guard&#39;s Stratton spotted one of the ice-breaking Chinese research vessels in the Chukchi Sea, near the US maritime border. The US cutter, which has powerful deck guns and carries a drone, shadowed the Chinese vessel. The reason for tailing the ship, said Adm. Gautier, the Coast Guard&#39;s head of operations, was to “just peacefully exert the fact that there&#39;s US sovereign interests there.”</p><p> China now has the world&#39;s largest navy by size, with the cruiser-destroyers like the Nanchang at the heavily armed vanguard. While the US has a qualitative edge with more-advanced warships, including a larger aircraft-carrier fleet, China is building them more quickly, Vice Adm. Karl Thomas, commander of the US Navy&#39;s Seventh Fleet, said in an interview last year with The Wall Street Journal. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Instead, Beijing&#39;s strategy is to play a supporting role for Russia in the region.</p><h3> Heightened tensions</h3><p> Not since the Cold War have Arctic tensions between the US and Russia been so high.</p><p> In those decades, Russia and members of NATO began monitoring the Arctic, since it was the shortest path for intercontinental missiles and bombers to reach their targets.</p><p> Both sides invested heavily in Arctic facilities, ranging from radar to ice-capable submarines. In the twilight of the Cold War, Soviet and American nuclear submarines collided twice in Arctic waters north of the main Soviet submarine base on Fennoscandia, near the border with Norway, causing damage to the submarines and headaches for diplomats but avoiding a military conflict.</p><p> In 1987, two years before the fall of the Berlin Wall, Soviet Union leader Mikhail Gorbachev signaled a willingness to dial back tensions. He warned in a speech in the Arctic city of Murmansk, Russia, near the submarine base, that the “militarization of this part of the world is assuming threatening dimensions.”</p><p> Three decades later, the seizure of Crimea and the broader invasion of Ukraine have rekindled old tensions, and the US led Western nations to impose a raft of sanctions on Russia&#39;s economy. Western oil and gas giants halted their investment and technology cooperation with Russian firms, especially in technically challenging areas such as the Arctic. On a visit to Nordic countries in June, Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced the reopening of a Cold War-era diplomatic outpost north of the Arctic Circle in Tromsoe, Norway.</p><p> Moscow has been marginalized in the Tromsoe-based Arctic Council, the regional governing group that includes the US, Canada and other nations with Arctic territory. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sweden-races-to-secure-turkish-support-for-nato-bid-2452c14f?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Sweden and Finland, which long aspired to neutrality, signed up for NATO</a> , and with the expectation that Sweden will complete its membership soon, Russia will be the only Arctic Council voting nation outside the Western military alliance.

Inflation fell to 3% in the US in June, according to the Fed&#39;s preferred gauge, the personal-consumption expenditures price index, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/us-inflation-june-2022-consumer-price-index-11657664129?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">down from 7% one year earlier</a> .

The ripple effects gave the illusion of broader, more persistent price increases.</p><p> Take the auto market. Sellers weren&#39;t able to meet pent-up demand two years ago, leading to huge price increases, which in turn spawned higher prices later on for car repairs and auto insurance.</p><p> Similarly, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/housing-slump-set-to-give-fed-an-inflation-fighting-assist-11671915427?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">a surge in household formation</a> during the pandemic <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rising-rents-pose-risks-to-the-feds-inflation-outlook-11628424000?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">sent up housing prices and rents</a> .</p><p> The first camp attributes most of the recent decline in inflation to the ebbing of these one-time supply disruptions, not rate increases, which are supposed to work through the labor market. “It&#39;s calling into question a lot of the old assumptions,” said Lindsay Owens, executive director at the Groundwork Collaborative, a liberal think tank.</p><p> A second camp, which includes most economists, disagrees.

The prospect that central bankers would risk a recession to bring down inflation may have influenced expectations of price- and wage-setters, including corporate executives who plan annual budgets for investment and hiring.</p><p> Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, warned one year ago of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jamie-dimon-says-u-s-consumers-still-have-six-to-nine-months-of-spending-power-11654102800?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">an economic “hurricane”</a> as central banks accelerated rate increases. “You&#39;d better brace yourself,” he said in June 2022, and pledged the bank would be “very conservative” with its balance sheet.</p><p> “Inflation is coming down precisely because the Fed avoided more excess demand growth, and they anchored inflation expectations,” said Angel Ubide, head of economic research for global fixed income at Citadel, a hedge-fund firm.</p><p> Inflation would be higher now if not for Fed rate increases, “and maybe still rising,” said Karen Dynan, an economist at Harvard University.</p><p> In 2021, supply-chain constraints meant even marginal increases in demand led to unusually large price increases.

Those large retailers primarily ship full truckloads to stores and warehouses, but Yellow and other less-than-truckload, or LTL, carriers give customers an opportunity to fill inventory gaps with smaller quantities.<p></p><p> In 2003, Yellow <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB105766973940541900?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">bought Roadway</a> , another LTL trucking firm for around $1 billion in cash and stock. Both companies were unionized, while many other LTL competitors weren&#39;t.</p><p> The two companies had “been trying to kill each other for 100 years,” said Bill Zollars,</p> who was Yellow&#39;s chief executive from 1999 to 2011. Executives believed a merger would give each a chance to be more competitive with nonunion rivals.<p></p><h3> Merger Mistakes</h3><p> The two companies combined back-office functions but not networks, limiting cost savings. In <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB110956132986765654?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">2005 Yellow bought another large competitor</a> , USF, for $1.37 billion, again combining back-office functions but not the broader company.</p><p> At the time, the companies were operating near full capacity, so it didn&#39;t make sense to combine larger operations, Zollars said. Then the 2008 recession hit, trucking demand evaporated and executives wished they had integrated faster, he said. Business with Walmart, then the largest customer, dropped around 50% between 2008 and 2010, he said.</p><p> “If we had known about the length and depth of the recession, we would have integrated faster,” he said. “Hindsight is 20/20.” The company integrated some parts of the Yellow and Roadway networks, but not USF, which was a network of regional carriers.</p><p> Executives negotiated with the Teamsters and creditors to avoid bankruptcy and fend off investors. In 2010, they <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704350304574638750418217422?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">reached a deal</a> that largely wiped out shareholders and that required the union to agree to cuts in benefits and pay.</p><p> Debt from the mergers and <strong>&nbsp;</strong> the operational complexity of running disparate brands continued to haunt the company. The company said bankruptcy loomed again in 2014 and 2020.</p><p> Zollars said the company&#39;s finances improved immediately after the mergers and the acquisitions offered the company significant savings, but the damage from the recession proved too deep. “I don&#39;t think it&#39;s fair to say that the debt load was the reason,” he said. Roughly half of the company&#39;s debt today is from more recent government loans, he said.</p><h3> Stuck in Neutral</h3><p> Since 2009, Yellow&#39;s annual revenues have hovered close to $5 billion, but the company has posted losses most years and never a profit above $25 million. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"><img width="600" height="800" src="https://images.wsj.net/im-826216?width=600" alt="不明确的" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><p> James Welch, who was CEO from 2011 to 2018, said he aimed to run the company as separate businesses to avoid inflaming workers and the union, as well as to please customers who used each service differently. “It was suggested several times during my tenure to integrate and I said, &#39;Don&#39;t do that,&#39;” he said.</p><p> Welch said the company&#39;s deal-making debt was its undoing. “We were just taking on too much debt and overpaid,” said Welch, whom lenders had brought back in 2011 after an earlier stint at the company. Digesting the debt “has been a slog for 20 years,” the former CEO said.</p><p> In retrospect he wishes he would have shrunk the Yellow and Roadway parts of the business further, favoring the USF regional carriers that had become a more productive side of the company, he said.</p><p> Satish Jindel, president of SJ Consulting, which advises shippers, said Yellow&#39;s on-time performance lagged behind rivals and its average revenue per shipment in 2022 was $319, while many of the competitors get more than $400 per shipment. “They have not operated and managed well,” Jindel said. “You have to have proper service to get good rates.”</p><p> The debt load, past failures to integrate operations and prior union concessions “were the results of actions taken long before the current Board or management was in place,” the Yellow spokeswoman said. The company&#39;s current integration plan would fix those mistakes and make the company competitive, she said.</p><h3> Covid Rescue</h3><p> When the Covid-19 pandemic shut down factories and stores in 2020, the company, then known as YRC Worldwide, said it would struggle to make its debt payments.</p><p> The federal government <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yrc-lenders-agree-to-extend-truckers-debt-terms-11594238914?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=3&amp;mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">threw it a lifeline</a> with a $700 million loan as part of a Covid rescue package, which prompted lenders to give it a three-year reprieve on payments. The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-treasury-to-loan-700-million-to-trucking-firm-yrc-worldwide-11593602409?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Treasury Department said</a> that Yellow&#39;s services to the Defense Department were important to national security.</p><p> “It&#39;s a new day. We&#39;ve just got to not blow it up,” then YRC Chief Financial Officer Jamie Pierson said in an interview in 2020. In 2021, under current CEO Darren Hawkins, the company said it would use the loan to push ahead with a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trucker-yellow-seeks-to-steady-finances-by-streamlining-operations-11622466000" target="_blank" class="icon none">sweeping integration.</a></p><p> A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/treasury-shouldnt-have-given-pandemic-aid-to-trucking-company-report-finds-889cd7ad" target="_blank" class="icon none">congressional report</a> in June 2023 concluded that the Treasury Department had skirted its own rules in giving out the loan and that the Trump administration erred in lending the money to the troubled company. The loan was supported by the Teamsters at the time as a job-saving measure.</p><h3> Teamsters Tensions</h3><p> Yellow&#39;s financial woes have mounted this year as declining shipping demand across the freight sector has cut into volumes and sent rates falling. Its cash holdings <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trucker-yellow-is-losing-customers-as-teamsters-strike-looms-2c47bcdc" target="_blank" class="icon none">fell to around $100 million in June</a> from $235 million in December.</p><p> The company made progress on its integration in its western region, then worked to push ahead across the country. Those actions triggered sharp and escalating exchanges between the Teamsters and the company.</p><p> The Teamsters said the company needed to renegotiate its multiyear contract, which expires after March 2024, to carry out its operating changes. Yellow <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trucker-yellow-is-suing-teamsters-union-over-changes-to-operations-d25b4640?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">filed suit</a> on June 27, accusing the Teamsters of blocking the changes and costing the trucker business. The company said inaction could push Yellow into liquidation.</p><p> In June, the company sought to defer two pension-fund payments, putting it $50 million behind in its contributions. The Teamsters threatened to strike mid-July if the company didn&#39;t make the payment, spooking customers.</p><p> Mike Regan, an executive at TranzAct Technologies, which helps retailers and manufacturers manage their freight, said the clash triggered the latest financial tailspin. “The Teamsters clearly overplayed their hand,” he said.</p><p> Teamsters President Sean O&#39;Brien said mismanagement is the root of Yellow&#39;s troubles, not union demands.</p><p> “We do not want to see any company suffer and go out of business, but at some point in time, we cannot keep sacrificing wages, conditions that our forefathers and foresisters had fought long and hard for in our freight division,” he said at a rally in Atlanta July 22.</p><p> Yellow <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/trucker-yellow-wins-reprieve-from-lenders-including-u-s-government-8f8553b8?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">got a 30-day reprieve</a> to catch up on the pension and benefits fund payment. But few customers are waiting around.</p><p> “In times like this, when a business is under stress, you just stay away,” said Jeff Tucker, chief executive of New Jersey-based freight broker Tucker Company Worldwide. “You keep your freight away from their network.”</p><p> Write to Sarah Nassauer at <a href="mailto:Sarah.Nassauer@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">Sarah.Nassauer@wsj.com</a> and Paul Page at <a href="mailto:paul.page@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">paul.page@wsj.com</a></p><p id="correction" class="correction"> <strong>Corrections &amp; Amplifications</strong><br> Yellow has around 22,000 Teamsters employees.
