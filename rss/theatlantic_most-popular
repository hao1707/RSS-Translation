Robert Oppenheimer) 在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1949/02/the-open-mind/305431/">这本杂志</a>上写下了一场可怕的失败。自从曼哈顿计划在新墨西哥州引爆第一颗原子弹以来，已经过去了近四年。爆炸向周围的山脉发出了紫色的光芒，并从沙漠地面升起一道 40,000 英尺高的火柱、烟雾和碎片。但对奥本海默来说，余辉很快就暗淡了，取而代之的是存在主义的头号宿醉。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1949/02/the-open-mind/305431/">1949 年 2 月起：J. 罗伯特·奥本海默 (J. Robert Oppenheimer) 的《开放思想》</a><br><br>克里斯托弗·诺兰的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/">新奥本海默传记片中</a>最令人心碎的部分发生在希里安·墨菲饰演的这位伟大科学家开始经历困扰他余生的幻灭感时。当他看着两枚炸弹从他的沙漠实验室开往日本的卡车上隆隆作响时，任何认为它们的可怕威力在他控制之下的幻想都被戳破了。三位一体测试三周后，广岛遭到轰炸。在影片中，生病的奥本海默将目光从受害者毁容的照片上移开。就像诺兰的镜头一样，让人不忍直视。<br><br>奥本海默后来说，通过原子弹，物理学家开始了解罪恶。从知识之树上摘下危险的果实后，他们把自己——以及全人类——托付给了一个堕落的世界，不断遭受自我灭绝的可能性的折磨。战争刚结束时，奥本海默安慰自己，或者也许是欺骗自己，他的发明的世界末日潜力可以而且将会得到遏制，部分通过他的努力。<br><br>奥本海默有理由相信他的影响力。公众接受了他的个人传奇：出于对拥有核武器的希特勒的恐惧，他冒险进入了看不见的原子领域，并带着巨大的力量回来了，能够阻止战争感冒，让儿子回到母亲身边。他身上堆满了荣誉。在诺兰的电影中，我们看到奥本海默被争取担任一个豪华角色：普林斯顿大学高级研究所所长，阿尔伯特·爱因斯坦的学术故乡。奥本海默还担任负责向美国原子能委员会提供建议的委员会主席。 20 世纪 40 年代后半叶，他关于科学问题的言论具有非凡的严肃性。 “当然，他对原子能潜力的了解与任何活着的美国人一样多，”他在<em>《大西洋月刊》</em>上发表的文章顶部的编辑注释中写道。<br><br>他用这个巨大的声音做了什么？他反对开发威力更强大的第二代原子武器——被爱德华·泰勒称为“超级”的氢弹——部分原因是他担心这会加速与苏联的军备竞赛。他还利用自己的声望和信誉来持续努力避免军备竞赛。他帮助起草了后来演变为“巴鲁克计划”的提案，这是美国向联合国提交的一项军备控制制度。在后者的指导下，所有国家都将放弃其原子武器计划，原子能将成为全球集体财产，由联合国的中央监管机构管理，任何国家都没有否决权。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/07/us-nuclear-strategy-cold-war-russia/638441/">阅读：我们没有核战略</a><br><br>1948 年，这些提议在联合国最终失败后，奥本海默转向了<em>《大西洋月刊》</em> 。他的文章是一件令人着迷的历史文物，也是公众悲痛的表现。它的标题是“开放的思想”，阐述了奥本海默对军备控制提案反复讨论的描述。苏联领导人投了反对票，但他们的反应并非完全否定。他们一致认为，所有国​​家都应废除其原子武器计划，原子能应接受国际监督。但他们反对美国坚持在新系统投入运行之前继续其武器计划，这也许是可以理解的。他们希望哈里·杜鲁门总统首先解除武装，但他无法遵守这个条件。<br><br>在曼哈顿计划期间，奥本海默的远见能力让他失望了。无论他对原子内部结构的计算多么准确，他都错误地判断了在他和他的同事将原子内部结构分解后会发生的地缘政治后果。出于天真，或者野心的权宜盲目性，或者两者的某种结合，他可能相信在纳粹被击败后他可以停止进一步使用原子弹，或者原子弹的可怕景象最终会导致放弃更大规模的武器和战争。<br><br> 1949 年，他明白这样的放弃是不可能的。他写道，“我们看不到任何明确的路线可以说服世界各国政府与我们一起”进行原子裁军。这一次，影响是显而易见的，而且牵涉到美国，正如奥本海默哀叹的那样，美国“采取了一些我们原本希望可能会被普遍放弃的措施作为回应”。原子弹的大规模制造正在进行，美国科学家接到明确的命令，将新物理学用于更具破坏性的武器。<br><br>奥本海默看到一场惨淡的军备竞赛正在形成，这一次他的预见被证明是准确的。几个月之内，苏联成功测试了第一颗原子弹，仅仅三年后，即 1952 年，美国引爆了一枚氢弹，其威力大约是摧毁长崎的那颗氢弹的 500 倍。几年后，苏联也效仿了这一做法，到 1967 年奥本海默去世时，两国已拥有近 4 万枚核武器，其中许多都是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">一触即发的</a>。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">阅读：永远不要给人工智能核密码</a><br><br>奥本海默知道他帮助创造了这个世界。他试图让我们的读者为它的恐怖做好准备。总的来说，他的建议是不要失去希望，并记住我们对未来的想象力是有限的。奥本海默也许对充满不确定性的量子世界感到振奋，这在他年轻时就让他着迷。他似乎从这样一种信念中汲取了力量，即人类事务的宏观世界同样是偶然的，因此我们的命运没有任何事情是注定的。<br><br>奥本海默引用了亚伯拉罕·林肯在内战三年后在巴尔的摩发表的演讲。林肯说，在那场冲突开始时，很少有人预料到“家庭奴隶制会受到很大影响”，但事实确实如此。现实是不可预测的；它会让你大吃一惊。林肯提醒奥本海默，惊喜是双向的。一个看似堕落的世界有时可能会走向道德进步。<br><br>我们以前见过这样的转变，甚至在核领域也是如此。到了 20 世纪 80 年代，巨大的核武器库似乎已成为地球上的一个事实。 1986年，苏联的弹头库存达到历史最高水平，约为4万枚，美国则超过2万枚。很少有人想到冷战即将结束。许多人也没有想到，乔治·H·W·布什和米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫将在 1991 年签署《削减战略武器条约》，这是一系列非同寻常的协议中的第一项，这些协议将两国的武库规模削减到了之前规模的四分之一以下。<br><br>布什和戈尔巴乔夫明智地抓住了这一天，因为那个时代的和平及其干净的两党战略对称性被证明是短暂的。此后，核毁灭的幽灵强势回归全球集体心理。弗拉基米尔·普京在有关<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://Read:%20What%20if%20Russia%20uses%20nuclear%20weapons%20in%20Ukraine?">入侵乌克兰的</a>演讲中援引了这一点。中国已经建立了一个足以摧毁美国所有主要城市的武库。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/russia-ukraine-nuclear-weapon-us-response/661315/">阅读：如果俄罗斯在乌克兰使用核武器怎么办？</a><br><br>正如奥本海默深知的那样，从<em>技术</em>上讲，威胁世界的核武器库存不会在我们身边存在数十万年。在任何小型交易所都很容易成为大型交易所的战略环境中，要让大量交易所长期存在，就是在玩傻瓜游戏。没有人应该感到安全，因为七十年过去了，没有再发生核战争事件；样本量太小。<br><br>除了提出希望之外，奥本海默并没有就如何拆除他帮助悬挂在人类文明之上的达摩克利斯之剑提供太多指导。作为一个臭名昭著的花花公子和雄辩的即兴演说家，他总是被风格所吸引。在他的<em>《大西洋月刊》</em>文章中，他以更高的形式引用了这一点。他写道：“在外交政策领域，风格使我们能够在追求对我们至关重要的目标与尊重那些可能从另一个角度看待问题的人的观点、情感和愿望之间找到和谐。”<br><br>奥本海默想到的问题是军备控制。他要求那些代表美国进行谈判的人本着开放的精神开展工作。他要求它们能够吸引坐在桌子对面的人的理性思维。他似乎相信——或者想要相信——这种风格的广泛采用可能足以启动地缘政治新的进化步骤，通过这一步骤，世界主要大国可能会达成共识，即和平是最高智慧。为此，他建议保持耐心。他指出，必须让时间和自然发挥作用。七十年过去了，这看起来确实是一项缓慢的工作。<br><br></div>

看似荒谬的 X 品牌重塑的三种理论<br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/JZeYzwBTVyFMw8BhsJxJAECy7ms=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/twitter_X_horz/original.jpg" alt="Twitter 的小鸟标志位于 X 上方" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>本·科特/大西洋月刊</figcaption></figure>五月份，埃隆·马斯克主持对 Twitter 主页进行了一次不同寻常的微妙调整。多年来，页面顶部文本框中的提示都是“发生了什么？”，这是友好地邀请用户分享他们的想法。这位亿万富翁接管八个月后，Twitter 稍微<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/05/12/heres-how-twitters-appearance-has-changed-under-elon-musk/?sh=76231c985f68">改变了</a>提示，以适应新政权下该平台令人费解、混乱的本质：“发生了什么事？”变成了“发生了什么事？！”<br><br>这个问题的紧迫性与过去 48 小时相比，与 Twitter 的关系最为密切，当时马斯克决定废除 17 年的品牌知名度并重新命名。这位以前被称为 Twitter 的艺术家现在是 X。<em>发生了什么事？！</em>的确。<br><br>除了简单的“没什么”之外，我对这个问题有三个答案。 （即使有了新名称，该网站也几乎和以前一样；网站左上角的蓝鸟标志现在是一个黑色的<em>X</em> ，而且……就是这样。）这个 X 可能只是一个不想拥有自己的社交网络并通过诉讼迫使其购买它的人的胡言乱语，但马斯克和 Twitter（X？）首席执行官琳达·亚卡里诺（Linda Yaccarino）希望你相信更大的事情即将到来。<br><br> <strong>1.马斯克想要建立“埃隆互联网”。</strong><br><br>第一个理论要求认真对待马斯克的野心。在去年 10 月的一条推文中，他 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633">宣称</a>“购买 Twitter 是创建 X 这个一切应用程序的加速剂。”这些“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/18/23687125/elon-musk-twitter-x-super-app-wechat">超级应用程序</a>”的版本已经存在，并且在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲很受欢迎，所以我们知道这意味着什么：X 将作为一个整体平台发挥作用，包括支付处理和银行、拼车、新闻、与朋友的交流以及大量的商务。把它想象成互联网，但不要离开马斯克的围墙花园。在 2022 年 6 月 Twitter 市政厅<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23171541/leaked-transcript-elon-musk-first-meeting-twitter-employees">泄露的</a>录音中，马斯克暗示中国的微信是 X 的某种模型。“中国以外没有微信运动，”他说。 “我认为这是一个真正的机会来创造这一点。在中国，你基本上都生活在微信上，因为它对你的日常生活非常有用，非常有帮助。我认为，如果我们能够实现这一目标，甚至通过 Twitter 接近这一目标，那将是巨大的成功。”<br><br>如果你眯起眼睛，你就能看出其中的逻辑。 Twitter 上的很多人——影响者、自由职业者、小企业主——都使用这个平台来销售东西。其中许多人使用各种“个人简介中的链接”页面来引导人们进行工作并接收付款。 X，理论上的一切应用程序，可以简化和整合这些交流，并且像微信一样，从中 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/">产生收入</a>。马斯克已经启动了一项计划，与 Twitter 的一些较大的“创建者”帐户分享广告收入，该计划的早期受益者<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/twitter-creators-payments-right-wing/">包括</a>许多著名的右翼冲击运动员。如果他能够设法让数亿人在他的应用程序上生活、购物和银行，而不是发表垃圾言论并与白人民族主义者争论政治，那将是一个巨大的成功。<br><br>为此，X 需要构建一个先进、安全的支付平台；申请适当的监管许可来合法处理付款和储存资金；当然，还要招募企业和金融机构使用该平台。据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/9d84d534-b2dd-4cff-85d1-aee137b26a45"><em>英国《金融时报》报道</em></a>，该公司于今年年初开始提交这些许可证的申请，并一直在建设部分支付基础设施。坏消息是，马斯克负责牵头该项目的人被解雇了，Twitter 约<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html">80%</a>的员工也被解雇了。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/elon-musk-twitter-ethics-algorithm-biases/673110/">阅读：我亲眼目睹埃隆·马斯克从内部扼杀了 Twitter 的文化</a><br><br>马斯克在支付业务方面确实有经验。他于 1999 年创立了一家在线银行（也称为 X.com），不久后与 Confinity 合并，成为 PayPal。如果不是马斯克在过去 15 个月里在众目睽睽之下在他最新的商业冒险中犯了错误，也许这会给他的超级应用想法带来一些可信度。他以其反动和阴谋性的政治观点疏远了广告商，使公司深陷债务，有时还通过限制用户可以看到的推文数量而<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-outage-elon-musk-user-restrictions/674609/">导致该平台无法使用</a>。根据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-traffic-falls-under-elon-musk-threads-mastodon-bluesky-competition/">第三方</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1678065025750294532?s=20">流量数据</a>，该平台在马斯克的领导下似乎正在萎缩。垃圾邮件<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/09/technology/elon-musk-twitter-spam-bots.html">猖獗</a>，最满意的用户似乎是以前被禁止的种族主义者和反犹太主义者，他们重新获得了扩音器的使用权。<br><br>对于马斯克来说，要让人们相信他的溅射平台是发布<em>巴本</em>海默模因的最佳场所已经很困难了，更不用说是……一切事物的正确归宿，包括我们的钱。但当你考虑解释 X 的第二种方式时，马斯克的声誉失血和他的宏伟野心之间的认知失调就更容易弥合了，即这是一次在黑暗中孤注一掷的尝试。<br><br> <strong>2. X 是<em>伪软件</em>——只是流行语和徽标。</strong><br><br>与 Facebook <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg/620538/">转向 Meta</a>的方向不同，Meta 是围绕一个真实的（尽管有缺陷且没有吸引力的）虚拟现实产品，X 是一个品牌重塑，只不过是一些模糊的流行语集合，拼凑在一起形成一个完整的句子。周日，亚卡里诺将即将推出的应用程序<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213895463215104?s=20">描述</a>为“无限互动的未来状态”，“以音频、视频、消息、支付/银行业务为中心——为创意、商品、服务和机会创建一个全球市场。”她还指出，“在人工智能的支持下，X 将以我们刚刚开始想象的方式连接我们所有人。” （亚卡里诺没有回应置评请求。）<br><br>她的推文是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/630ec150bcbd490021b17eab/business-dudes-need-to-stop-talking-like-this/">商业人士<em>lorem ipsum</em></a>的近乎完美的例子——公司的胡言乱语，表面上听起来很聪明，但实际上却令人困惑。什么是“无限互动”？ X将如何“由AI驱动”？她指的是像 ChatGPT 这样的生成式人工智能，还是多年来为 Twitter 的“For you”提要提供支持的标准算法？细节无关紧要：这些词串在一起时听起来像<em>什么</em>就可以了。<br><br>马斯克也犯过这样的胡言乱语。他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1683324036950966273?s=20">认为</a>，他的假设项目如果构建正确，可能“成为全球金融体系的一半”。这是业余爱好者的空洞语言，相当于我告诉你这篇文章如果写得正确，有望赢得普利策解释性新闻奖，或者我是<em>《大西洋月刊</em>》关于计算机的文字部分的执行文字大师。<br><br>马斯克和亚卡里诺对 X 的描述不仅仅意味着<em>“汽件”（vaporware）</em> ，这是一个行业术语，指的是一种从未实现的大肆宣传的产品。它们也感觉像是别的东西：我称之为<em>伪软件</em>。与<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/6258e039dc551a00208cc5e1/elon-musk-meme-stocks-and-retail-investing-for-the-superrich/">伪事件</a>一样，伪软件伪装成具有新闻价值的事物，尽管事实并非如此。亚卡里诺的 Mad Libs-ian 推文风暴是这个伪事件的新闻稿：迄今为止已在装饰性变化中体现出来的支点的大讨论。马斯克的首要任务是采用新标志并将其<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1683541303680987136?s=20">投影</a>在总部的会议室中。当 Yaccarino 发推文说“X 将以我们刚刚开始想象的方式将我们所有人联系起来”时，我相信她的话：似乎没有人花太多时间思考这一切。<br><br>人们很自然地想知道为什么世界上最富有的人会花时间拆除世界上最知名的社交媒体品牌之一，转而支持一个无人问津的神秘超级应用程序。他可以随时飞往私人岛屿，一边喝着无限量的冰镇果汁朗姆酒，一边咯咯地谈论狗狗币！这里有对X的第三个也是最重要的解释，那就是它是马斯克的声誉信用额度。<br><br> <strong>3.马斯克需要挽回面子。</strong><br><br>马斯克的声誉取决于人们相信他能够开辟新的工业类别，并能看到周围的角落，创造出未来的东西。他斥资 440 亿美元收购 Twitter 时提出了一个富有远见的框架：马斯克将实现 Twitter 成为真正的全球城镇广场的梦想，并大规模解决言论自由的棘手问题。在这方面失败后，马斯克本质上是在 X 回归基础——这是一个按照他自己的形象重塑互联网的机会。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-outage-elon-musk-user-restrictions/674609/">阅读：埃隆·马斯克这次真的打破了推特</a><br><br>正如<em>彭博社</em>的 Max Chafkin <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/chafkin/status/1683475959981264900/photo/2">指出的</a>那样，马斯克最初的 X.com 品牌彻底失败了。他对这个名字和网址很着迷，但消费者将这个品牌与成人娱乐网站联系起来，这并非不合逻辑。 2000 年合并后，马斯克被 X.com 董事会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-elon-musk-fired-from-paypal/">驱逐</a>，一年后该服务更名为 PayPal，但这家支付公司仍然是他遗产的重要组成部分。那么，X 是对年轻版企业家的回想——他与成功、有效的产品和丰厚的投资者回报联系在一起。这也代表着未完成的事业以及重写他职业生涯早期阶段的机会。<br><br>从这个意义上说，X与其说是一个辉煌的愿景，不如说是一种绝望的行为。马斯克的行为很像一家烧钱速度不可持续的初创公司——他需要现金注入。为了筹集一些声誉资本，他需要一个好主意，一个看起来合理且可扩展的主意。 X 勾选了这个想法的所有方框。它的野心如此模糊以至于无边无际，这标志着永恒的增长和赚钱——毫不夸张地说，它是<em>一切</em>应用程序。这样，X对于任何仍然想相信马斯克的人来说都是一个墨迹测试：以正确的方式眯起眼睛，X就会呈现出该人对互联网未来的任何希望和梦想的形式。这就是伪软件的转瞬即逝的天才：营销一款应用程序的最大特点是，你几乎什么都不说就可以逃脱惩罚。<br><br>但到底有多少人仍然对马斯克抱有坚定的信心，这是一个悬而未决的问题。有多少人愿意对不能按时支付<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/twitter-evicted-boulder-office-colorado-unpaid-rent-elon-musk-16949921.htm#:~:text=The%20company%20failed%20to%20pay,to%20non%2Dpayment%20of%20rent.">租金</a>和服务器<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.platformer.news/p/twitter-stiffs-google">费用</a>的人进行无罪推定？谁将帮助这位解雇了公司大部分股权​​并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/12/twitter-severance-payments-lawsuit">据称</a>欠下 5 亿美元遣散费的人打造这家科技巨头？也许最重要的是，谁对马斯克将时间、精力和金钱集中在什么事情上感到兴奋？<br><br>尽管 X 想要做大，但与马斯克将自己推销为专家的项目相比，微信克隆在概念上还是很小的：太空探索、重新连接人类大脑、彻底改变交通以拯救地球。对X最愤世嫉俗的观点是，那些仍然尊重马斯克的人都是反动派，他们只有在敌人被兴高采烈地嘲笑时才感到高兴。那么，马斯克对社交网络的拆除也许是成功的，只要它让正确的人痛苦即可。由于别无选择，马斯克决定抵押 Twitter 品牌来拯救自己的品牌。即使按照他的标准，这也是一个冒险的赌注。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 16:56:12 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

英尺，腰部同步弯曲，然后像压碎的汽水罐一样塌陷。十秒钟之内，他们就倒塌成滚滚尘土。<br><br>对于任何观看过拆除过程或在网上观看过视频的人来说，这个信息很明确：TVA，一家规模庞大的联邦公用事业公司，成立于 90 年前，是富兰克林·D·罗斯福总统新政的一部分，正在摆脱煤炭。<br><br>尽管该地区的一些人对此举感到遗憾，但这对当地环境和全球气候来说是一场胜利。在过去的几年里，随着减缓气候变化的紧迫性日益增强，人们就如何做到这一点达成了共识：绿色电网，同时尽可能地重组经济体——汽车、建筑、工厂——以使用零碳电力运行。乔·拜登总统去年 8 月签署的《抑制通货膨胀法案》以 3700 亿美元的补贴支持该计划。在 2021 年的行政命令中，拜登指示联邦政府“以身作则，到 2035 年实现无碳污染的电力部门”，并到 2050 年实现净零经济。<br><br>鉴于这一战略，电力公司对我们的未来至关重要，尤其是美国最大的公共电力提供商 TVA。其领土几乎涵盖整个田纳西州；阿拉巴马州、密西西比州和肯塔基州的大片地区；以及其他三个州的一些情况。在美国最保守的地区之一，1000 万人从联邦机构获得电力，而该机构无需向股东负责，也无利润可赚。<br><br> “TVA 是一只疯狂的独角兽，它与众不同，”南方清洁能源联盟执行董事斯蒂芬·史密斯 (Stephen Smith) 告诉我。作为一个联邦机构，TVA 不仅负责促进清洁能源转型，还负责建设清洁能源转型，它的定位是提供一个国家模式，TVA 表示它正在这样做。<br><br>但这并不是史密斯和其他环保倡导者对 TVA 行为的描述。他们看到一家公用事业公司正在用燃气发电厂取代天堂和其他地方的燃煤发电厂，这将污染气候数十年。他们看到一家公用事业公司在尚不存在的小型核反应堆上投入了大量资金。他们表示，最重要的是，TVA 未能采用成熟的清洁能源技术，例如太阳能和风能以及能源效率措施。<br><br> “TVA 是一个活生生的实验室，可以成为推动清洁能源转型的巨大推动力的一部分，”史密斯说。他认为这不再是一个“为实现零碳而战备的机构”，而是成为“行政部门的一个障碍”。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link"

已将碳排放量减少了一半以上</a>，远远高于全国电力行业的平均水平，同时收费低于平均水平。它通过用天然气替代煤炭并启动大型新核反应堆来实现这一目标。但与大多数美国公用事业公司一样，TVA 没有计划在 2035 年实现拜登提出的净零电网目标；它的目标是到那时只减少 80% 的碳排放。 “我们渴望到 2050 年实现净零排放，如果可以的话，我们渴望走得更远、更快，”自 2019 年起担任 TVA 总裁兼首席执行官的 Jeff Lyash 在 11 月的该机构董事会会议上表示。但就现有技术而言，他认为这是不可能的。<br><br>实现净零排放的正确道路是什么？田纳西河流域是一场全国性辩论的一个富有启发性的缩影，其中解决气候变化的必要性与不仅要维持可靠的电力供应，还要大幅扩大电力供应以满足脱碳经济的需求的巨大实际挑战之间的矛盾。 “TVA 在引领清洁能源未来方面处于独特的地位，”Lyash 在 11 月表示。他和他的批评者在这一点上达成了一致。但至于那个未来何时到来、是什么样子，他们确实相差甚远。<br><br>时间<br><br><span class="smallcaps">VA 诞生</span>于另一场全球危机。 1933 年，当罗斯福和内布拉斯加州共和党参议员乔治·诺里斯说服国会建立田纳西州管理局时，美国正处于大萧条的最低谷，田纳西河谷是美国最贫困的地区之一，那里只有极少数的家庭通电。 TVA 改变了它。从阿拉巴马州马斯尔肖尔斯的威尔逊大坝开始，一系列水坝控制了田纳西河及其支流的洪水，并使整个山谷通电。水力发电厂仍以无碳方式生产该地区约 10% 的电力。<br><br>私人公用事业公司讨厌TVA，并强烈抱怨他们认为不公平的竞争。他们两次向最高法院质疑该机构的存在，但都失败了。直到 20 世纪 50 年代，德怀特·艾森豪威尔 (Dwight Eisenhower) 总统还想出售该机构，他认为该机构是“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/18/archives/eisenhower-points-to-the-t-v-a-as-creeping-socialism-example.html">社会主义蠕动</a>”的一个例子。该机构通过半独立于联邦政府而得以生存。 TVA 的董事会由总统任命，国会确认，但自 1959 年以来，TVA 的大部分运作都没有联邦拨款。它通过出售电力来支付自己的费用——不是直接向消费​​者（除了几十个工业和联邦财产），而是向 153 家市政或合作拥有的地方电力公司 (LPC) 出售电力，这些公司负责向人民分配电力。<br><br>从一开始，TVA 的战略就是让电力变得便宜且容易获得，以便人们可以用它来做一切事情。该机构取得了如此巨大的成功，以至于需求很快就超过了即使是完全筑坝的河流也无法满足的需求。 20世纪50年代，TVA开始依赖煤炭作为主要能源，最终建造了12座大型发电厂。在过去的十年里，它已经关闭了六家，但仍然留下了大量的有毒火山灰。 2008 年，田纳西州金斯顿燃煤电厂的堤坝破裂， <a data-event-element="inline link"

年代，当新成立的环境保护局开始监管空气污染时，TVA 进行了抵制。习惯于自己做出工程决策的它认为，为其煤堆投资洗涤器是没有意义的——毕竟，它即将用核反应堆取代其中的大部分。但该机构只完成了计划中的 17 座反应堆中的 7 座——电力需求的增长速度低于预期——如今，未完工的反应堆残骸散布在山谷各处。此次惨败使 TVA 陷入债务困境，债务总额仍接近 200 亿美元。<br><br><a

和阿巴拉契亚山脉的破坏</a><br><br>尽管如此，TVA仍对其核舰队感到自豪。尽管佐治亚电力公司预计很快就会将一座新反应堆投入运行，但 TVA 是过去三十年来唯一一家做到这一点的美国公用事业公司。 1973 年，该公司开始在田纳西州瓦茨巴工厂建造两座反应堆；将它们封存多年；然后分别于 1996 年和 2016 年完成。2023 年上半年，它们和该机构的其他反应堆帮助该机构发电了近 60% 的千瓦时而不排放碳，明显高于全国平均水平。但史蒂芬·史密斯告诉我，它“摸索、失败、失败”，陷入了令人羡慕的境地。史密斯说，气候危机需要变革，而 TVA 已经放弃了提供这种变革的历史使命。<br><br>在<span class="smallcaps">查塔努加市中心</span>，直接负责向该山谷 1000 万居民供电的人员坐在 TVA 的系统运营中心。这是一间宽敞、安静、灯光昏暗的房间，一排排弯曲的工作站面向墙壁，墙上贴满了 TVA 庞大的传输网格的照明示意图。第一排操作员跟踪输电线路的物理状况和电压。它们背后的运营商根据需要从电网周围的数百台发电机“调度”电力，每分钟都匹配供应与需求。这项复杂的工作通过拥有大量“可调度”电力而得到简化，这些电力是煤炭、天然气、核能和水力发电厂提供的，至少在原则上是这样：电力可以在一天或一年中的任何时间提供。<br><br>在俯瞰控制室的会议室里，我见到了 TVA 副总裁兼负责传输和供电的高级副总裁 Greg Henrich 和 Aaron Melda。梅尔达帮助制定了该机构的脱碳战略，他抓起一支记号笔在挂图上勾勒出数字。该战略的核心内容是到 2035 年关闭 TVA 的最后五座燃煤电厂，这些电厂的运行时间均超过 50 年。“同期，我们将增加 10,000 兆瓦的太阳能发电量，”梅尔达说。为了在没有阳光的时候储存能量，TVA 还将增加 1,000 兆瓦的电池容量。<br><br>不过，在接下来的十年里，该机构的主要碳减排战略是建造更多的天然气发电厂——价值 7,000 兆瓦，大致相当于当前燃煤电厂的容量。当我去年秋天参观系统运营中心时，TVA 正在敲定最新扩建项目的计划：位于田纳西州坎伯兰市的一座 1,450 兆瓦天然气发电厂，位于田纳西州坎伯兰市最大的燃煤发电厂所在地，该发电厂的两台发电机组计划于 2026 年和 2028 年退役。环保人士强烈反对这座天然气发电厂，甚至连 EPA 也对此提出质疑，认为这将使 TVA 在 2035 年甚至 2050 年之后很久才排放碳。不过，在短期内，改用煤炭将大幅减少碳和其他污染物的排放。 “用天然气代替煤炭，现在每一兆瓦的碳强度都降低了 50%，”梅尔达说。<br><br> Why not just build more batteries and more solar, and take the intensity down to zero? It would cost a lot more, Melda said, and batteries discharge within several hours. A few rainy days could leave you unable to meet demand. Nor is solar a big help on dark winter mornings, which are the moments that TVA worries about most. The majority of homes in the Valley have electric heat. A spokesperson for TVA, Scott Fiedler, later said that gas is “the only mature technology that allows us to quickly add renewable energy and maintain the low cost and reliability” needed.<br><br> I visited the system-ops center on a chilly November day a week before Thanksgiving. Early that morning, as people cranked up their thermostat, TVA had seen a fairly typical winter peak in the load on its grid. Warmer weather was coming that would drive down demand, Henrich said, but it would rise again on Thanksgiving morning, as people roasted turkeys. That afternoon, the load would plummet. “Everybody&#39;s asleep on the couch,” Henrich said. “It&#39;s awesome to watch—it&#39;s truly societal behavior driving your load.”<br><br> He opened the blinds on the conference-room windows so we could see into the control room itself. It looked pretty quiet, with a lot of the workstations empty. “When does it ever get exciting?” I asked. A month later, my question was answered.<br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">n December 23</span> , people in the Tennessee Valley awoke to temperatures that had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/tennessee/2023/01/19/tva-blackouts-winter-storm-cold-aging-power-plants/69777671007/">plunged 40 degrees or more overnight</a> . Worse, both units of the Cumberland coal plant had shut down, because thick ice from a big storm had encased instruments on the exposed boilers. In the morning, the Bull Run coal plant wouldn&#39;t start, and some natural-gas plants failed too. As demand soared to an all-time winter record of 33,427 megawatts, the operators in Chattanooga found themselves about 8,000 megawatts short. Neighboring utilities couldn&#39;t help; the storm had affected half the country.<br><br> For two hours that morning, TVA had to instruct its 153 local power companies to cut demand by 5 percent. On Christmas Eve, it asked for a 10 percent cut for more than five hours. To comply, the LPCs shut off power neighborhood by neighborhood for 15 minutes or more at a time. The rolling blackouts were the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2023/jan/31/tva-looking-into-ways-to-avoid-future-outages-tfp/">first in TVA&#39;s 90-year history</a> . At Christmas dinner, Fiedler told me, his mother required him to explain why his storied organization had cut her power on the holiday. “She wore me out,” he said.<br><br> TVA likes to boast of its reliability, and environmental advocates seized on the Christmas failure. “The emperor has no clothes,” Amanda Garcia, the director of the Southern Environmental Law Center&#39;s Tennessee office, told me. “The winter storm to me provided a perfect example of why TVA needs to change”—by showing that fossil fuels are no guarantee of reliability and that it should be transitioning to renewables faster. The Sierra Club ranks TVA among the very worst American utilities for its energy transition. The Center for Biological Diversity calls it a “climate laggard.” Both want the agency to replace all its coal plants as soon as possible with renewable energy, not gas.<br><br> A modeling study released in March by the Center for Biological Diversity and by GridLab, a nonprofit consulting group, concluded that TVA could indeed stop burning both coal and gas by 2035. To do that, it would need to build the equivalent of about 145 large solar farms, with a total capacity of 35 gigawatts, in its territory, along with the transmission lines needed to import about 12 gigawatts of wind power from the Midwest. (The Valley isn&#39;t windy enough to produce cost-effective wind power.) Then, by 2050, it would have to nearly triple that expansion again in order to electrify and decarbonize the Valley&#39;s economy. The goals are ambitious, given the delays that now plague many renewable and transmission projects—but the benefits to society would dwarf the costs, the study found. Consumers would save more than $250 billion, mostly from switching to cars that run on TVA&#39;s electricity rather than gasoline. Carbon emissions would drop by hundreds of millions of tons.<br><br> The first step toward a clean-energy future, advocates agree, would be to reduce energy waste in the Valley. About a quarter of homes there rely on resistance heating—the method employed in electric furnaces and space heaters. Many heat pumps also fall back on it at freezing temperatures, Huntsville Utilities&#39; president and CEO, Wes Kelley, told me. “That is basically the equivalent of turning on a bunch of big hair dryers to heat your house,” Kelley said.<br><br> According to National Renewable Energy Laboratory <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://resstock.nrel.gov/factsheets/TN">estimates</a> , efficiency measures, including more and better heat pumps, could save roughly as much electricity as the Cumberland gas plant will generate. “If you reduce that resistance heating, you&#39;re helping the system as a whole”—by reducing the peak load—“as well as the customer,” Maggie Shober, the research director at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE), told me. Because people in the Valley use so much electricity, monthly bills are high even though rates are low, creating an especially heavy burden on the poor.<br><br> Utilities generally have little incentive to invest in energy-saving measures, which only reduce their revenue. But TVA should be different: It doesn&#39;t need to make a profit. Since 2018, it has run an admirable program, called Home Uplift, that provides heat pumps, weatherization, and other measures to low-income homeowners, all for free—but so far, only to 5,000 of the hundreds of thousands of Valley residents who might be eligible. TVA could do much more, SACE and other critics say, especially now that the Inflation Reduction Act is subsidizing energy-efficiency programs. For its part, TVA says it&#39;s planning more of these types of investments, including rebates to replace older and less efficient heat pumps. Fiedler, the TVA spokesperson, said the agency will lower energy costs in underserved communities by $200 million over the next five years through Home Uplift and other programs.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he environmental advocates</span> I talked with were all suspicious of TVA&#39;s clean-energy intentions. SACE&#39;s Stephen Smith, a close observer of the agency for more than three decades, thinks TVA is building gas plants now and planning nuclear for the future because large power plants are what it is comfortable building, and it has a monopoly on building them in the Valley. The future of the industry should lie in “shifting from central stations to a more distributed model that opens up a whole new powerful toolbox for fixing the climate crisis,” Smith said. “But TVA is not going there.”<br><br> He and other advocates see a “rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future,” to quote the most recent United Nations climate report, and in that stark light, TVA&#39;s current fleet of renewables looks inadequate, especially if you set aside the hydroelectric dams and focus on what it has achieved lately. It buys about 1,200 megawatts of wind from the Midwest; it has installed about 1,000 megawatts of solar capacity in the Valley. That&#39;s far less solar power, Amanda Garcia pointed out, than deployed by utilities in the Carolinas or Georgia. Though she acknowledged TVA&#39;s plans to expand solar over the coming decade, “actions speak louder than words,” she said.<br><br> But TVA is actually making a big effort these days, Gil Hough, the executive director of TenneSEIA, the state solar-industry association, told me. Hough worked for SACE from 2000 to 2010, promoting solar with Smith. Now he helps deliver it to TVA.<br><br> In the mid-2010s, he told me, the agency did indeed walk away from solar because it was focused on paying down its nuclear debt. Under Lyash, though, TVA has changed, Hough said. It may have only 1,000 megawatts of solar online—but it has more than 2,200 under construction or contracted. “TVA wants every megawatt we can provide them right now,” Hough said. “It&#39;s <i>us</i> who&#39;s holding <i>them</i> back.” Supply-chain disruptions have slowed solar projects and raised prices. But Lyash announced in May that TVA would award contracts this year for 6,000 megawatts of solar power, to be brought online between 2026 and 2029. “We are building as much solar as we can get panels for,” he said.<br><br> What got TVA&#39;s attention was the demand from large corporations, says Reagan Farr, the CEO of the Nashville-based Silicon Ranch, which owns and operates solar farms for TVA and other utilities. Farr told me that companies like Google and Meta, by insisting on renewable energy, convinced TVA that it could no longer fulfill its mission of economic development without expanding its solar capacity. “The power of these large companies—their procurement decisions drive actions,” Farr said.<br><br> Local resistance to solar farms is a growing problem, both TVA and the industry say. At the November TVA board meeting, Chief Operating Officer Don Moul <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/environment/2022/11/10/tva-memphis-coal-ash-to-build-solar-farm/69637542007/">announced a $216 million plan to build a 100-megawatt solar plant on top of the coal-ash pile at the Shawnee power plant</a> , in Kentucky. If it works, Moul said, as much as 1,000 megawatts of solar might one day rise from ash piles around the region—poetic justice, and a way to “alleviate some of the land challenges that we&#39;ve heard about from so many of our stakeholders,” Moul said.<br><br> One of TVA&#39;s key constituencies are the local power companies that distribute its electricity. Their perspective is often very different from that of environmental advocates. At a listening session before a February 2023 board meeting in Muscle Shoals, a dozen of their representatives got up to speak—not about renewables or climate change, but about the blackouts. They were a “black eye for all of us in the Valley,” said Brian Solsbee, the executive director of the Tennessee Municipal Electric Power Association and a former TVA employee. “How does TVA ensure it never happens again?” It needs new generation capacity, Huntsville Utilities&#39; Wes Kelley told me.<br><br> When it was Lyash&#39;s turn to speak, he said what he has said repeatedly: that TVA plans to use all available technologies to decarbonize. He promised a renewed focus on energy efficiency and an aggressive expansion of solar—but also of gas and, in the long run, nuclear. “Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket,” he said. Renewables, in his view, are one basket.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he Tennessee Valley</span> is going through a period of economic expansion that would make Roosevelt proud, and TVA, with its reputation for cheap and reliable power, is partly responsible. The Valley&#39;s new growth includes electric-vehicle, battery, and solar-panel manufacturers—the industries that will drive the electrification of America. When I first met Lyash in Chattanooga, where he had just presented TVA&#39;s Engineer of the Year award, he rattled off some of the names. “Ford, GM, Toyota, Mazda, Volkswagen, LG, SK—those industries are going to decarbonize transportation,” he said. “So we have to provide them the energy <i>now</i> .” Demand is growing already, and Lyash expects it potentially to double by 2050. A study last year by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which mapped how the grid might be decarbonized by 2035, in line with Biden&#39;s goal, assumed that demand might even double by then.<br><br> The decision to build a new gas plant at Cumberland comes in that context as well as that of climate urgency. In TVA&#39;s view, even if it could build enough additional renewables and transmission lines to replace the Cumberland coal unit it plans to retire by 2026, which it says it can&#39;t, solar and wind wouldn&#39;t offer “firm, dispatchable power”—power that&#39;s available regardless of weather or time of day. The basic problem, as the NREL report explains, is “seasonal mismatch”: There&#39;s not enough sunlight to meet peak demand on cold winter mornings and not enough wind on hot summer afternoons; both can be minimal for days.<br><br> Given this reality, is it reasonable to build a new gas plant today, even though it will emit some carbon for years to come? I put the question to Paul Denholm, a senior research fellow at NREL and the lead author of the recent study. “That is a fantastic question, and it&#39;s something everybody is trying to figure out,” he said.<br><br> All visions of a decarbonized grid and of an electrified, net-zero society require huge expansions of wind and solar power. But the NREL study foresees that a net-zero grid will also need some kind of gas to meet peak demand. In three of its four net-zero scenarios, turbines are still burning substantial amounts of natural gas in 2035, and the carbon is being captured rather than released into the atmosphere. In all scenarios, many gas turbines are retrofitted to burn zero-carbon hydrogen.<br><br> TVA&#39;s vision of the future, as Lyash and Aaron Melda explained it to me, aligns broadly with the NREL study. Any gas plants that TVA builds now, they said, will one day either burn “green hydrogen” or involve carbon capture—neither is in wide use yet, and TVA is investing in both. The reason TVA won&#39;t promise a net-zero grid by 2035, Lyash said, is because “it&#39;s going to take deploying technologies that are not currently available at a price people can afford and a scale that can be implemented.” The NREL study assumes that those technologies will be developed in time to reach net zero by 2035; TVA doesn&#39;t want to count on that.<br><br> It&#39;s no surprise, Denholm said, that utilities are struggling to figure out how to cut the last 10 to 20 percent of their carbon emissions. NREL researchers haven&#39;t figured it out either. “The fact that you have conservative utilities saying they know how to [cut] 80 percent—that is a really remarkable shift,” he told me. “I think we need to recognize that and applaud it.”<br><br> Another influential report, Princeton&#39;s 2021 “Net-Zero America” study, included a scenario in which <i>only</i> renewable energy was allowed: By 2050, wind turbines were visible from about one-eighth of the area of the Lower 48 states, solar farms covered an area the size of West Virginia, and long-distance transmission lines mushroomed to five times their existing capacity. Even when such facilities share land with other uses—Silicon Ranch, for instance, allows sheep to graze or pollinator gardens to bloom among the solar panels—they are a significant industrial intrusion on the landscape.<br><br> In some regions, people may prefer less of those—and more of the compact central power stations that TVA knows how to build. The NREL and Princeton studies both include net-zero scenarios in which the expansion of renewable facilities and transmission lines is constrained, perhaps by “challenges with siting and land use,” as NREL puts it. Both scenarios rely, as does TVA, on nuclear plants. “I can&#39;t make the numbers work without new nuclear,” Lyash told me.<br><br> Like many nuclear engineers these days, he thinks the future lies in small modular reactors, or SMRs. At a site on the Clinch River, TVA is planning the first of what it hopes will be a fleet of 20 or so identical SMRs, using a relatively conventional design. “Our goal is not just to build a plant, but to build a plant that sets the model for the US industry,” Greg Boerschig, one of the engineers running the TVA effort, told me.<br><br> The way environmentalists focus on TVA&#39;s renewable capacity or lack thereof frustrates Lyash. “The point is,” he said, “what are your carbon emissions, and what&#39;s your price, and what&#39;s your reliability?” Different regions with different starting points—Arizona has a lot of sunshine, Oklahoma has wind, TVA has a legacy of nuclear and hydro—might reach their clean-energy goals in different ways.<br><br> Toward the end of our last conversation, Lyash opened an app on his phone that shows real-time carbon emissions from electricity generation. “One of the countries that gets held up as having deployed huge amounts of solar, and it&#39;s a big percentage of their capacity, is Germany,” he said. “Germany&#39;s carbon emissions right now are 426 grams per unit of electricity. And today, right now, TVA&#39;s is 247 … And our price is less than a third of theirs.”<br><br> That happened to be a bad day for Germany&#39;s numbers and a good one for TVA&#39;s—but long-term data confirm Lyash&#39;s point: Germany gets a far higher percentage of its electricity from renewables than TVA, but emits substantially more carbon per kilowatt-hour. Germany has made different choices. It closed its last nuclear reactor in April.<br><br> E <span class="smallcaps">nvironmentalists are right</span> to be wary of TVA. In the past it has performed badly on a variety of environmental issues. It built an unnecessary dam, the Tellico, that drowned important Cherokee cultural sites and hundreds of farms and notoriously threatened to extinguish a little fish, the snail darter. (The darter has since recovered.) It stepped back from solar and energy-efficiency efforts when it could have led the way. It was slow to reduce air pollution from its coal plants—which are still lethal polluters—and allowed the major coal-ash disaster in Kingston to happen. This May, even as Lyash was promising 6,000 megawatts of new renewable energy, TVA doubled down on its Cumberland decision: It released a draft environmental-impact statement saying that it also wanted to replace the Kingston plant with gas power by the end of 2027. That will lock in higher emissions for longer, environmentalists say.<br><br> Garcia and Smith think TVA lacks public accountability. They point out that it has no independent public-service commission to regulate it, only a board that, like corporate boards, has no staff of its own and thus depends on management. They would like to loosen TVA&#39;s monopoly and free local power companies to buy power elsewhere, bridling the “unicorn” with market discipline.<br><br> But that would risk undermining the very thing that makes the agency such a precious unicorn: the public-power model. TVA has retained political support, at least in its sphere, for an active government role in improving people&#39;s lives. And in a region where environmental causes are hardly unifying, TVA has said, publicly and repeatedly, that it wants to stop emitting carbon as fast as it can. How it does that should be debated—but in many conversations with TVA and its critics, I never heard a solid reason to doubt its good faith.<br><br> As I traveled the Tennessee Valley, I visited monuments from TVA&#39;s golden age, including Wilson Dam, in northwestern Alabama, with its lofty, sunlit turbine hall and arches like a Roman aqueduct&#39;s, and Norris Dam, in northeastern Tennessee, which closes off the narrow Clinch River with a tall, sculptural curve. TVA engineers and the people of this region built these marvels “for generations yet unborn,” as Senator George Norris liked to say,  with no notion of how valuable they would become in an age of climate change.<br><br> Now it&#39;s time to build more.<br><br> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article is part of the</i> Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">Planet series supported by the HHMI Department of Science Education.</i></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 16:44:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tennessee-valley-authority-energy-transition-nuclear/674729/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tennessee-valley-authority-energy-transition-nuclear/674729/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Two Players Who Tell the Story of U.S. Women’s Soccer]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Megan Rapinoe represents the national team&#39;s legacy; Alyssa Thompson, its future. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/89pjUd2MTqnOxtJ8tu8OcqdGuUE=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/womens_soccer/original.jpg" alt="Alyssa Thompson substituting in with Megan Rapinoe in a soccer match" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Brad Smith / Getty</figcaption></figure> I <span class="smallcaps">n 2019, I stood in a bar in Atlanta, Georgia,</span> surrounded by hundreds of other people adorned in red, blue, and white. It was the semifinals of the Women&#39;s World Cup, and the United States was playing against England. The US women were looking to go on to the final, but this would be no easy feat.<br><br> The game moved back and forth: The US scored in the first 10 minutes of the match, and the English scored about 10 minutes later. Then, 31 minutes in, the US captain, Alex Morgan, cut across an English defender and headed in the game-winning goal. She celebrated by pretending to sip a cup of tea. The Atlanta bar went wild, perhaps just as much for the trolling celebration as for the goal. A friend of mine, who spends far more of his time watching the NFL and NBA than women&#39;s soccer, turned to me and said, “This is the most fun I&#39;ve ever had watching sports in my life!”<br><br> The US would go on to defeat the Netherlands in the final to win its fourth World Cup. But the 2019 tournament was also a special turning point for women&#39;s soccer in America. It&#39;s clear, looking back, that the emotional investment of so many American fans was tied not only to the team&#39;s accomplishments on the field, but also to the national and sporting politics of the moment. For many, Megan Rapinoe, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/megan-rapinoe-new-muhammad-ali/592867/">the star of that World Cup</a> who continuously spoke out against homophobia, racism, and sexism, became a symbolic counterweight to the Trump administration. Watching the top women&#39;s soccer player in the world (Rapinoe would officially win the Best FIFA Women&#39;s Player award a few months later) adorned in the colors and crest of the United States provided many fans with a sense of pride in their country after years of political tumult. The success of the women&#39;s team also coincided with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/womens-world-cup-final-boon-equal-pay/593419/">their legal fight to be paid equally</a> to the men&#39;s team. Throughout the tournament, many people got the sense that cheering for the national team also meant rooting for the effort to close the gap between men and women in other areas of American life.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-soccer/674802/">Read: The Women&#39;s World Cup is about more than soccer</a><br><br> If the 2019 women&#39;s team represented a soccer culture in flux, this year&#39;s squad speaks to something else: how the women&#39;s game in the United States has never been more stable than it is today.<br><br> Rapinoe, now 38 and playing in her fourth World Cup, has announced that this will be her last tournament and that she will retire from professional soccer at the end of her domestic season. Rapinoe is the squad&#39;s oldest player, and her journey has been long. After she left the University of Portland, she decided to go professional in 2009. She became the second overall pick of the inaugural Women&#39;s Professional Soccer league at a time when the average salary of a professional women&#39;s player in the US was roughly $25,000. Just a year later, her team folded, and only two years after <em>that</em> , the entire league suspended operations. Rapinoe then played in Australia and France, and even in an amateur league, before joining the newly formed National Women&#39;s Soccer League in the US in 2013. She has played for OL Reign (formerly the Seattle Reign FC) ever since.<br><br> Now consider Rapinoe&#39;s teammate, Alyssa Thompson. She is 18 years old, currently in her first season in the NWSL, and, as of Friday&#39;s 3–0 win against Vietnam, the second-youngest player ever to represent the country in a World Cup.<br><br> The gap between the experience of the youngest and oldest members of the team tells the story of women&#39;s soccer in the United States. The NWSL is now in its 11th season. The league and the players have their <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/nwsl-players-make-history-with-first-ever-collective-bargaining-agreement-ahead-of-2022-preseason/">first-ever collective-bargaining agreement</a> , which includes an increase in player salaries, free housing, health insurance, 401(k)s, and formal parental leave. (The new agreement also put in place new protocols for player safety, something that took on an additional, urgent importance following a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/03/1126587851/womens-soccer-abuse-nwsl-report">2022 report</a> that found that emotional abuse and sexual misconduct were a systemic issue in the league.) More than 1 million fans attended NWSL matches last season. And this season, the average attendance on the opening night beat the league&#39;s previous attendance record <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://frontofficesports.com/nwsl-crushes-attendance-record-with-media-deal-looming/">by nearly 50 percent</a> .<br><br> Thompson&#39;s team, Angel City FC, based in Los Angeles, represents an unprecedented level of success and optimism for women&#39;s professional soccer. The team is owned by a conglomerate of high-profile celebrities including Natalie Portman, America Ferrera, Eva Longoria, and Serena Williams, as well as former soccer greats such as Mia Hamm, Abby Wambach, Julie Foudy, and Shannon Boxx. Their games have been attended by Hollywood stars and have an average home attendance of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://soccerstadiumdigest.com/2023-nwsl-attendance/">nearly 20,000 people</a> a game this season, which is higher than the average of more than a dozen Major League Soccer men&#39;s teams. HBO produced a three-part documentary about the team this past May. As of last year, the team reportedly has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nwsl-valuations-soar-angel-city-040100393.html?amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALTYTIYrACmWnVGMYi1mMRxgVkwRudQ7WFCdBV_3zOI_dEIFbys4os-LiD98ojy1fQ9DyG0NRMsPkCfkSRqkWS4bJI0nWiEhES1x_BWWGA4bFGYtpN3iuN7SW4pgip8kvJ7FcBqYi-1naZqiJ2wePhRDApj2b5goC6bOHzfzWQVG&amp;guccounter=2">a valuation of $100 million</a> , twice as much as any other team in the league.<br><br> Though she is just in her first professional season, Thompson is quickly becoming the face of the franchise. Michael Holzer has been the private coach of Thompson and her sister Gisele (a year younger and a member of the US Women&#39;s Youth National Team) for the past two and a half years. He told me that Thompson was born with a natural gift for soccer but has also competed against boys and older women since she was about 13 years old. Of both sisters, he said, “I would often put them with adult college players or adult pro players to really test and challenge them.” Holzer also said that many of his sessions with the sisters would begin at 5:30 am, before school started, and that the two have pushed each other to a higher level. “They&#39;re so disciplined. That&#39;s what separates them, beyond their talent,” he said. He added something else that differentiates Thompson: “She is also incredibly fast.” (Even that might be an understatement. Thompson ran the 100-meter dash her junior year of high school in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a44292226/alyssa-thompson-us-womens-national-team/">11.69 seconds</a> , one of the fastest times in the state, despite making track practice only periodically because of soccer.)<br><br> Thompson hadn&#39;t originally intended to go pro this early. She had committed to Stanford, a longtime powerhouse in women&#39;s soccer that has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.soccerwire.com/soccer-blog/stanford-world-cup-legacy/">served as an incubator</a> for future national-team players. But Holzer said that plans changed for Thompson following her national-team debut last year. In October 2022, when she was still in her senior year of high school, she made her first appearance for the US Women&#39;s National Team (USWNT), subbing in for the player she had long admired, Rapinoe. “I think that experience showed her and her family that she&#39;s ready,” Holzer told me. Angel City thought she was ready too, and spent nearly half a million dollars to ensure their selection of Thompson as the first overall pick in the 2023 NWSL draft this January.<br><br> Thompson has already shown why Angel City made such a big bet on her. Eleven minutes into her NWSL debut this past March, she received a pass from her teammate on the left side of the field, dropped her shoulder, let the ball run across the front of her body, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UULuwgn6mw4">fired a shot from about 20 yards out</a> into the top right-hand corner of the net. She became the second-youngest player in the league to score in a debut, and the fourth youngest to score any NWSL goal. She was still two months away from her high-school graduation. A couple of months later, she became the first teenager to make a USWNT roster since 1995.<br><br> Still, it is difficult to overstate the amount of groundwork that has been laid for players like Thompson by the athletes who came before them. When Thompson was growing up, many women who played professional soccer had to take on other jobs, most teams struggled to have even a few thousand people show up to games, and little protected the players from exploitation and abuse. The NWSL is still growing, and more can be done to support its athletes, but the landscape of US women&#39;s soccer today is radically different from Rapinoe&#39;s early days. Thompson is acutely aware of this. “I feel like I was born at the right time, because the women&#39;s game is growing so much right now,” she said in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBy_oCaKQKg"><em>Players&#39; Tribune</em> interview</a> alongside her Angel City teammate Christen Press, a veteran of the USWNT and winner of two World Cups. Referring to Press, she said, “All the players like you and past national-team players made it to where it is now, and it&#39;s honestly amazing, because this would not be an option” before. In particular, she talked about her amazement at substituting for Rapinoe in her debut: “I could not stop thinking about going in, like, <em>I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m here</em> .”<br><br> Thompson isn&#39;t the only one here—a whole new generation of young women are at this year&#39;s World Cup. There&#39;s 21-year-old Trinity Rodman, who has reportedly signed the most lucrative contract in NWSL history, and there&#39;s 22-year-old Sophia Smith, the reigning US Women&#39;s Player of the Year, who scored twice in the opening game against Vietnam. These women, and others, represent the present and future of the US national team. It is a legacy they intend to protect.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 16:29:24 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-2023-nwsl-megan-rapinoe-alyssa-thompson/674816/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-2023-nwsl-megan-rapinoe-alyssa-thompson/674816/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[A New Kind of Fascism]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> I&#39;ve resisted using the word until now, but something menacing and novel is taking shape with the possibility of a second Trump term. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/YUXcFiauXpQZv1KuRzhYZNE0DR4=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/trump/original.jpg" alt="特朗普在连任竞选中" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Damon Winter / The New York Times / Redux</figcaption></figure> For some years, a variety of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.salon.com/tv/video/vuli6z">news commentators</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/1/29/22250294/trump-american-fascism-jason-stanley">academics</a> have called Donald Trump a fascist. I was one of those who resisted using that term. I thought it had long been abused by casual, imprecise applications, and as a historian of Nazi Germany, I did not think Trumpism was anywhere close to crossing the threshold of that comparison. I still deny that Trump&#39;s presidency was <i>fascist</i> ; but I&#39;m concerned that if he wins another trip to the White House, he could earn the label.<br><br> Fascism was most fully exemplified by the regimes of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. These regimes combined totalitarian dictatorship, wars of imperial conquest, and outright genocide in the case of Hitler (of Jews, Slavs, Roma) or ethnic mass murder in Mussolini&#39;s case (of Libyans, Ethiopians, Slovenes). Placing Trumpism in the same category seemed to me trivializing and misleading.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/10/25/suffocation-of-democracy/">I argued instead that</a> Trump was more like Hungary&#39;s Viktor Orbán or Turkey&#39;s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan than Hitler or Mussolini, and should be categorized as an “illiberal populist” rather than a fascist. And in one very important respect, Trump differed sharply from the European fascists of the interwar period.<br><br> They were ardent militarists and imperialists. War was the crucible in which the new fascist man was to be forged; territorial expansion was both the means and the end of fascist power and triumph. Trump has shown little ambition to pursue such aims. In his first term, he shamelessly abased himself before Russian President Vladimir Putin, exchanged <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/19/how-trumps-love-letters-with-kim-jong-un-could-cost-him/">“love letters”</a> with North Korea&#39;s Kim Jong Un, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/20/trump-peace-deal-taliban/">signed the Doha Agreement</a> with the Taliban committing the US to withdrawal from Afghanistan, and petulantly sought to downgrade US treaty obligations to NATO and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-shakedowns-are-threatening-two-key-u-s-alliances-in-asia/">South Korean</a> allies that he deemed to be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-hits-germany-and-other-delinquent-nato-countries-for-lack-of-defense-spending">“delinquent”</a> and getting a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/30/trumps-claim-that-the-u-s-pays-the-lions-share-for-nato/">“free ride.”</a><br><br> Trump has continued in the same isolationist vein in recent interviews and speeches. He has railed against “globalists.” He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2023/05/11/trump-tells-cnn-town-hall-i-want-everyone-to-stop-dying-in-ukraine/">has promised</a> to settle the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in 24 hours by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-claims-could-zelensky-putin-225254398.html">cutting off aid</a> to Kyiv if President Volodymyr Zelensky does not reach an immediate settlement with Moscow—that is, capitulate to Putin. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4947134">has disparaged</a> Taiwan as a predator nation that stole microchip manufacturing from the US (That Chinese President Xi Jinping would construe the simultaneous abandonment of Ukraine and dismissal of Taiwan as anything other than a green light to invade the latter seems improbable.)<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/nazi-germany-hitler-democracy-weimar/671605/">Christopher R. Browning: How Hitler&#39;s enablers undid democracy in Germany</a><br><br> No question, Trump inflicted grave damage on our country&#39;s political culture, stoking toxic polarization and reveling in dishonesty. And Trumpism did exhibit distinct elements of the fascist style of politics: the inflammatory rallies; the incessant mongering of fear, grievance, and victimization; the casual endorsement of violence; the pervasive embrace of conspiracy theories; the performative cruelty; the feral instinct for targeting marginalized and vulnerable minorities; and the cult of personality. But the Trump presidency lacked any warlike, expansionist interest, and that made it decisively unlike 20th-century fascism.<br><br> Thankfully, also, Trump himself was too lazy, inexperienced, and unprepared to set about systematically constructing a true dictatorship. The main focus of the Trump presidency was less plans and programs and more the theatrics of satisfying his constant, insatiable need for attention and adulation. Everything—whether <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/07/president-trumps-repeated-claim-greatest-economy-history-our-country/">the state of the economy</a> or the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/donald-trump-shares-chocolate-cake-great-chemistry-china-s-xi-n745931">chocolate cake served</a> to China&#39;s Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago—had to be extolled as “the greatest ever.”<br><br> Until the final weeks of Trump&#39;s term, the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/the-seven-broken-guardrails-of-democracy/484829/">guardrails</a> of American democracy seemed to hold firm. The institutions of the federal government remained relatively intact, and civil servants largely secure and uncorrupted. The United States <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-us-democracy-has-declined-significantly-past-decade-reforms-urgently-needed">experienced</a> democratic backsliding but not democratic collapse.<br><br> In a second term, however, a newly emboldened Trump could well attack democracy itself. The MAGA Republican Party of his making has openly explored ways to transform states where they control all branches of government. States that were once pluralistic democracies with at least some chance of a transfer of power are coming to resemble one-party regimes directed by a minority of the population. ( <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/tennessee-republican-partisanship-one-party-state/674732/">Anne Applebaum&#39;s report</a> from Tennessee is a case history in point.)<br><br> In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis, Trump&#39;s putative rival for the 2024 Republican nomination, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/ron-desantis-2024-florida-authoritarian/673483/">has turned his state</a> into a laboratory for testing how a determined, calculating, uninhibited authoritarian can maximize executive power. In many respects, he has already accomplished at the state level what Trump did not have the discipline and focus to do at the federal level. And DeSantis has created a blueprint for other Republican state leaders to follow.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/americans-have-lost-sight-what-fascism-means/616846/">Shadi Hamid: Americans are losing sight of what <em>fascism</em> means</a><br><br> Just as state Republicans have become more ruthlessly autocratic in their methods, a new Trump presidency would be much more efficiently goal-oriented  at the federal level. A huge transformation of the administrative state <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/us/politics/trump-plans-2025.html">is being deliberately planned</a> . The government agencies and civil service he has decried as the “deep state” would be purged or politicized, and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/donald-trump-rally-waco-2024-campaign/673526/">“retribution”</a> he has promised against his enemies would also be carried out. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/10/nathan-simington-christopher-waller-fcc-federal-reserve-appointments-unitary-executive-authority-444136">“unitary executive”</a> theory long promoted by some Republicans would become the reality of an unabashed authoritarianism.<br><br> The very last months of the Trump presidency foreshadowed what a second term would entail. When formerly loyal vassals such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/politics/william-barr-out-as-attorney-general/index.html">Attorney General William Barr</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/09/mark-esper-fired-defence-pentagon-donald-trump">Defense Secretary Mark Esper</a> demonstrated that they would not cross the line into unconstitutional insurgency, Trump sought sycophants for whom no such line existed. In a new Trump administration, total devotion to the leader would be the sole qualification for appointment.<br><br> Unlike previous fascist leaders with their cult of war, Trump still offers appeasement to dictators abroad, but he now promises something much closer to dictatorship at home. For me, what Trump is offering for his second presidency will meet the threshold, and the label I&#39;d choose to describe it would be “isolationist fascism.” Until now, such a concept would have been an oxymoron, a historical phenomenon without precedent. Trump continues to break every mold.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-second-term-isolationist-fascism/674791/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-second-term-isolationist-fascism/674791/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Can Nature Lie?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The lying that we humans do requires a more sophisticated kind of cognition than a bird, flower, or fungus can muster. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ztGHXuqlSdyMBqYFY1KSgFWVRDA=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/humans_lie_2_1/original.jpg" alt="A picture of a human crossing their fingers next to a picture of a lizard" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic.

Armstrong Roberts / Getty; Soumyabrata Roy / Getty.</figcaption></figure> Analyzing animals to better understand <i>Homo sapiens</i> has become a sub-genre in the field of science writing. Sometimes this works well, as when Sabrina Imbler uses a purple octopus, starving to death while incubating her eggs, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/12/pacific-octopus-vigil-motherhood-eating-disorders/672340/">as a metaphor for disordered eating</a> in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/how-far-the-light-reaches-a-life-in-ten-sea-creatures-sabrina-imbler/9780316540537?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>How Far the Light Reaches</em></a> . But other times, the enterprise feels downright Procrustean: An author amasses a wide swath of animal activities, even down to the level of the cell, and describes them in ways that might give the impression that some human quality has an analogue out there in the biosphere.<br><br> The compression is most strained when the activity being explained is complex and quintessentially human, such afs deception. This makes the enterprise of writing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-liars-of-nature-and-the-nature-of-liars-cheating-and-deception-in-the-living-world-lixing-sun/9780691198606?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Liars of Nature and the Nature of Liars</em></a> , a recent book by Lixing Sun, especially difficult. Sun, a professor of animal behavior, ecology, and evolution at Central Washington University, presents a string of entertaining facts about the many ways plants and animals use trickery to survive. But the language is too casually anthropomorphic, undermining the points he&#39;s trying to make about cheating in the natural world. At the outset, Sun acknowledges that ascribing intentionality to animal behavior is “neither easy nor necessary,” and admits that deceptive adaptations arise from the unplanned march of evolution. “Cheating flourishes in nature as a direct result of natural selection,” he writes. It also “serves as a potent selective force that drives evolution on its own.” But his word choices and awkward phrasing often leave the reader with only a partial understanding of how flora and fauna actually &quot;lie&quot; and &quot;deceive.&quot;<br><br> The behavior we think of as lying requires a more sophisticated kind of cognition than telling the truth does—and certainly a more sophisticated kind of cognition than a bird, flower, or fungus can muster. Years ago, when I was reporting an article about the science of deception, the psychologist <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.paulekman.com/">Paul Ekman</a> told me that a liar needs three qualities to succeed: the ability to think strategically, like a good chess player; the ability to read the needs of others, like a talented therapist; and the ability to manage emotions, like a grown-up. In other words, a good liar needs a high level of both cognitive and emotional intelligence.<br><br> And though lying—at least in humans—might be an ingenious skill, the evolution through which cheating arises in the natural world is not smart in the least. The way Sun describes each example makes it seem that plants and animals develop particular traits of fakery or mimicry out of some sort of mischievous, cunning impulse. But there&#39;s nothing deliberate about evolutionary adaptation, which is the perpetuation of traits, arising randomly, that improve an organism&#39;s chance of staying alive, reproducing, and passing along the same advantageous traits to the next generation. It&#39;s a stupid process, lacking not only intentionality but also any kind of end goal beyond helping a particular organism survive and reproduce.<br><br> Sun knows this; he&#39;s a biology professor, after all. But the diction he deploys suggest otherwise. Sun, like others, falls into the science-writing trap of stretching biological phenomena to fit the contours of human understanding. As a result, the reader can be forgiven for coming away with the impression that cheating fauna and flora—right down to the level of bacteria—are clever enough to always have, as he puts it in one of his many awkward attempts to be engaging, a few new “ruses up their sleeves.”<br><br> According to Sun, nature&#39;s cheats come in two varieties: liars and deceivers. Lying adheres to what he calls the First Law of Cheating: “falsifying messages in signaling.” Deceiving falls under his Second Law: “exploitation of biases, weaknesses, or deficits in the cognitive systems of another animal.”<br><br> But to illustrate these laws—indeed, even to define them—Sun uses terms that suggest intentionality; how else would you expect a lay audience to interpret active verbs like <i>falsifying</i> and <i>exploiting</i> ? But such an interpretation would be misleading. As Sun himself notes, evolution is a mindless process, with no plan, no direction, nothing except the fluke of a selective advantage generated by a completely arbitrary genetic blip.<br><br> His colorful word choices—no doubt employed to make his writing more accessible and fun—seem to elide this randomness altogether. He uses terms such as <em>imposters</em> , <em>hustlers</em> , and <em>con artists</em> to describe the book&#39;s animals, including Pacific tree frogs, and talks of the “tricks” that were “invented” by the duplicitous cuckoo. He uses words like these to characterize cheats that don&#39;t even have nervous systems, such as the South American passion flower. It has evolved spots on its leaves that resemble the eggs of the <em>Heliconius</em> butterfly, which cause the butterfly to avoid laying its clutch there and instead move on to a plant that looks unoccupied—a handy deflection, what Sun calls a “most peculiar form of plant mimicry,” because newly hatched <em>Heliconius</em> caterpillars can be quite destructive to the passion flower. As Sun chooses to describe it, those yellow spots arose because “these plants can &#39;read the mind&#39; of <em>Heliconius</em> butterflies.” But in truth, no plant ESP is involved; those fake-out butterfly eggs are the result of a random mutation in leaf coloration that turned out to have a benefit for the mutant plant. And using scare quotes around “read the mind” doesn&#39;t get the author off the hook. (Nor do scare quotes help when he describes the offspring of the normally monogamous dark-eyed junco as “birds born out of &#39;wedlock.&#39;”)<br><br> If you&#39;re looking for a compilation of weird facts about the splendors of the natural world—something that&#39;s been called the “gee-whiz” approach to science writing—this book delivers. It is an often-enlightening collection of some stunning acts of animal trickery that have evolved in the brutal Darwinian struggle for survival. Dropping some of the tidbits you picked up here would make you the hit of the cocktail party. Did you know, for instance, that the stripes of a zebra create a confusing effect called “razzle dazzle,” and that their advantage may be in keeping away tsetse flies? Then there&#39;s the cuckoo, one of the most notorious fakes on the planet, which deposits its own egg in the nest of one of as many as a dozen other bird species, tossing out one of the eggs that belong there and forcing the deceived mother to hatch and nurture its own newborn instead. And the sphinx caterpillar emits a whistle that mimics the alarm call of one of its predators, the chickadee, causing the chickadee to abandon its would-be meal and dive for cover.<br><br> In the last chapters of the book, Sun tries to draw a straight line from these many organisms to humans. We can, he writes, “use our newly acquired evolutionary understanding of how cheaters operate to design novel strategies to combat cheating in our society.” But that seems a fool&#39;s errand, missing much of the sophistication that deception in our own species entails. Yes, Sun acknowledges that cheating in humans is much richer in “scale, variety, intricacy, [and] novelty” than it is in other animals. And yes, he attributes this richness to our unique language ability, greater intelligence, and complex social structure. But as he attempts to cover a wide range of human deception—including Ponzi schemes, lies on social media, and infidelity—he doesn&#39;t actually have anything fresh or illuminating to offer.<br><br> Sun&#39;s desire to draw lessons from the natural world about human lies has a subtler danger: Other living things are not just furry or feathery little proto-people, and comparing their behavior to ours risks underappreciating them as the amazing organisms they are. The astounding variety of the biosphere, evolved through random mutations over the course of eons, is reason enough to marvel at all the ways that certain surprising conduct has helped plants and animals thrive. So my recommendation is to read <em>The Liars of Nature and the Nature of Liars</em> for its great cocktail-party fodder, and to leave lessons about human deception to the psychologists, neuroscientists, and philosophers.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 12:19:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/evolution-liars-of-nature-lixing-sun-review/674808/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/evolution-liars-of-nature-lixing-sun-review/674808/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The American Evangelical Church Is in Crisis.

These young people are committed to their Christian faith, but they feel despair and cynicism about the Church&#39;s future. Almost none of them even call themselves “evangelical” anymore, now that the label is confused with political categories. “Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m crazy,” one pastor said to me just days ago. “Does no one see that the Church is in crisis?”<br><br> Indeed it is. I am a conservative evangelical—previously the head of the public-policy wing of the Southern Baptist Convention. For years I dealt with evangelical backlash, including from some of my closest allies and friends, over my opposition to Donald Trump and my views on issues such as racial justice and Church sexual abuse. I hardly thought of myself as a “dissident.” Instead, I believed I was just what I&#39;d always been: a loyal Southern Baptist evangelical trying to apply what I&#39;d learned from children&#39;s Sunday school onward about basic Christian morality and justice. Still, I felt like an outcast and a heretic. I felt homeless. And two years ago, I left the Southern Baptist world I loved.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/06/evangelical-church-pastors-political-radicalization/629631/">Tim Alberta: How politics poisoned the evangelical church</a><br><br> I know that other evangelicals struggle with similar feelings. I am hard-pressed to think of one congregation that is not divided—or in an adrenal stance of tension about the imminence of division—over the turmoil of the political moment. This should be a time for revival in our churches. Revival is a concept with a long history in American evangelicalism, rooted in the Bible, that says a people who have grown cold and lifeless can be renewed in their faith. It is a kind of resurrection from the dead.<br><br> Yet the language of revival is now riddled with cynicism, and is associated with some of the worst aspects of American evangelicalism. Entrepreneurial American evangelicalism built a programmatic structure for “revival”—whether in the spring- and fall-meeting schedules of little Bible Belt churches like the one in which I grew up or in massive stadium events traveling across the country like rock concerts. As <i>The Guardian</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/15/the-guardian-view-on-american-christianity-change-and-decay">noted</a> in an editorial after the 2016 presidential election, “In the end, a market-driven religion gives rise to a market-driven approach to truth, and this development ultimately eviscerated conservative Christianity in the US and left it the possession of hypocrites and hucksters.”<br><br> Some evangelical Christians have confused “revival” with a return to a mythical golden age. A generation ago, one evangelical leader said that the goal of the religious right should be 1950s America, just without the sexism and racism. Today, even those qualifications are evaporating. Surveys show that, when compared with other religious groups and the general population, white evangelicals are the most susceptible to white-nationalist tropes such as the “Great Replacement” theory, and their institutions caricature the most basic commitments to racial justice as “critical race theory.” Denominations that are glacially slow to recognize documented sexual-abuse cover-ups are lightning quick to expel congregations they find to be too affirming of women&#39;s leadership.<br><br> However, the confusion of nostalgia with revival is not simply the terrain of MAGA-right evangelicalism. Many mainstream evangelicals assumed that we were all just waiting out a moment of disorder: <i>If we can just get through the 2016 presidential election, the pandemic, the racial-reckoning protests and backlashes, the 2020 presidential election, and the seemingly constant evangelical-leadership sex-and-abuse scandals, we&#39;ll end up safely back in 2015.</i> That&#39;s clearly not happening.<br><br> Crisis shakes up an old order—ripping apart, as the apostle Paul put it, what&#39;s made of “wood, hay, stubble” (1 Corinthians 3:12). Now every moment is a possible apocalypse—in which what&#39;s been around us all the while is revealed—and thus every moment is an hour of decision.<br><br> The idea of revival as a return to some real or imagined moment of greatness is not just illusory but dangerous. In the supposedly idyllic Christian America of the post–World War II era, the evangelical preacher AW Tozer wrote: “It is my considered opinion that under the present circumstances we do not want revival at all. A widespread revival of the kind of Christianity we know today in America might prove to be a moral tragedy from which we would not recover in a hundred years.” Tozer knew that the confusion of revival with nostalgia could amount to exactly what <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2022/august-web-only/body-christ-keeps-score-spiritual-trauma-sbc-church-abuse.html">contemporary psychologists tell us about trauma</a> : <i>What is not repaired is repeated.</i><br><br> That&#39;s why the crisis before evangelical America is not necessarily bad news. Many people, myself included, lament what we see as the fragmentation of the evangelical movement. People who once led ministries together no longer speak to one another. People who prayed together for decades now say to one another, “I don&#39;t even know who you are anymore!” All of this is in the context of an American culture that also seems to be fragmenting—a process accelerated by the collapse of mediating institutions and the growth of a social-media ecosystem—in ways that the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">compared in this magazine</a> to the destruction of the biblical Tower of Babel.<br><br> And yet, the problem with the Tower of Babel was not fragmentation. The problem was unity. The builders were united by their own hubris in building something that would ultimately destroy them. The confusion of the languages and the scattering of people were the work of God. The answer was not to reassemble the old architectural plans and start again. The answer instead was in the next chapter—with a lone figure, Abram of Ur, who heard a promise and trekked out into the desert, not knowing where he was going.<br><br> The answer to the crisis of credibility facing evangelical America is not fighting a battle for the “soul of evangelicalism,” with one group winning and exiling the losers. John and Charles Wesley did not replace the 18th-century Church of England to create Methodism, but their renewal movement still resonated throughout the world and with other Protestant denominations. Billy Graham was cast out from many of the fundamentalist sectors in which he had learned to preach the Gospel, but he carried the Gospel where his mentors never could.<br><br> The answer is instead what it has always been: Those who wish to hold on to the Old Time Religion must recognize that God is doing something new. The old alliances and coalitions are shaking apart. And the sense of disorientation, disillusionment, and political and religious “homelessness” that many Christians feel is not a problem to be overcome but a key part of the process. The insight of evangelical Christianity, at its best, is that any pilgrimage cannot start with a road map of certainty but must begin with the cry of faith that says, like the noble disciple Thomas wrongly labeled as a doubter, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How can we know the way?” (John 14:5).<br><br> Nostalgia—especially of the sort wielded by demagogues and authoritarians—cannot protect religious faith, because it uses religion as a tool for worldly ends, leaving a spiritual void. The Christian Church still needs an organic movement of people reminding the rest of us that there&#39;s hope for personal transformation, for the kind of crisis that leads to grace.<br><br> CS Lewis noted that the one prayer that God almost never grants is “encore.” Lewis wrote that our nostalgia for the “golden moments in the past” can be nourishing and sustaining, as long as we see them for what they are—memories, not blueprints. “Properly bedded down in a past which we do not miserably try to conjure back, they will send up exquisite growths,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cslewisinstitute.org/resources/reflections-september-2016/">Lewis argued</a> . “Leave the bulbs alone, and the new flowers will come up. Grub them up and hope, by fondling and sniffing, to get last year&#39;s blooms, and you will get nothing.”<br><br> If evangelicals deny the depths of the crisis in front of us, and simply opt for the sort of public relations that can preserve the coalitions and power structures of yesteryear, we will lose a generation longing to see whether the Gospel is real or just another means to mobilize voters or market to customers. We will find ourselves in one more contest to see what kind of power we can leverage to make that happen—which, as always, will put us on the side of the crucifiers rather than on the side of the Crucified.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/evangelical-trump-christians-politics/620469/">Peter Wehner: The evangelical church is breaking apart</a><br><br> Churches must stop the frantic rhetoric and desperate lack of confidence that seek to hold on to the Bible Belt of the past. Instead, those worthy of the word <i>evangelical</i> should nurture the joyous and tranquil fullness of faith that prays for something new, rooted in something very old—namely a commitment to personal faith and to the authority of the Bible.<br><br> That starts not with manifestos and strategic road maps, but with small-scale decisions to reawaken the awe of the God evangelicals proclaim. We must refocus our attention on conversion rather than culture wars and actually read the Bible rather than mine it for passages to win arguments. No individual can change the “evangelical movement” alone. Change comes, first, person by person, then congregation by congregation. If enough of us would embrace this sense of homelessness as our new normal—as where we should have been all along—then we can rekindle a longing for a different Kingdom to call home.<br><br> In a country exhausted by the quest to make America great again, perhaps what we need is to make evangelicalism born again.<br><br> And, in the end, that&#39;s not a strategy. It&#39;s a prayer.<br><br> <small><i>This article has been adapted from Russell Moore&#39;s forthcoming book,</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/losing-our-religion-an-altar-call-for-evangelical-america-russell-moore/9780593541784?affiliate_id=atl-347">Losing Our Religion: An Altar Call for Evangelical America</a> <i>.</i></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-evangelical-church-division-politics/674810/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-evangelical-church-division-politics/674810/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Seven Books for the Lifelong Learner]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> These books may tempt you to take up a new pursuit and enlarge your sense of your own capabilities. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/rKaC0goYzwabGHwRybphGxsgMns=/0x0:8000x4500/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/MakeBook_A_noNumbers/original.jpg" alt="制作一本小书的步骤图" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Ben Denzer for The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> For the past six months, I have been obsessed with housekeeping—something that, all of my former roommates can attest, I have previously shown neither interest in nor aptitude for. I have drawn up cleaning schedules, spent far too much time thinking about the relative merits of different fabrics, and become chipper when loading the dishwasher. I even recently found myself describing it as “fun.”<br><br> I credit and blame one book for all of this: Cheryl Mendelson&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/home-comforts-the-art-and-science-of-keeping-house-cheryl-mendelson/9780743272865?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Home Comforts</em></a> . First published in 1999, this unlikely best seller contains nearly 900 pages of practical advice—the proper way to wash dishes, the use of furniture paste wax. What drew me in was its wonderful opening essay, in which Mendelson, a novelist, professor, and lawyer, argues for the importance and dignity of keeping house—an act “that makes your home alive, that turns it into a small society in its own right, a vital place with its own ways and rhythms.” Although I remain a haphazard housekeeper, I&#39;ve become convinced that housekeeping is both an art and a science, an enterprise whose meaning extends far beyond keeping one&#39;s home clean.<br><br> The seven books below also describe the experience of becoming absorbed by a skill or craft, and deliver insights into what mundane activities—say, playing sports or learning a foreign language—can tell us about how we live today. Look closely enough at any human endeavor, these books suggest, and you&#39;ll find lessons on our relationship to the natural world, to history, to other cultures, and to our own body. And they so vividly capture the satisfactions of the pursuits they describe that you might be tempted to take up gardening or long-distance running or bookbinding and enlarge your sense of your own capabilities.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/in-other-words-jhumpa-lahiri/9781101911464?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>In Other Words</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Jhumpa Lahiri</strong><br><br> In 2012, Lahiri moved to Rome and stopped reading and writing in English in order to immerse herself in Italian. This bilingual series of reflections—the original Italian on the left, an English translation by Ann Goldstein on the right—charts her love affair with the Romance language, from her “indiscreet, absurd longing” upon first hearing it on a trip to Florence to the 20 years of language classes, tutoring, and diligent self-teaching that followed. The march toward fluency, she admits, is “a continuous trial.” She mixes up similar words such as <em>schiacciare</em> (“crush”) and <em>scacciare</em> (“expel”), uses the wrong prepositions, and can&#39;t quite get the hang of when to use simple or imperfect past tense. When she begins composing stories in Italian, she&#39;s aware that she will never attain the facility she has in English. But Italian reintroduces mystery, delight, and intensity to her reading: “Every page seems to have a light covering of mist,” she writes. “The obstacles stimulate me. Every new construction seems a marvel. Every unknown word a jewel.” Beneath her sense of wonder is a deeper argument—that plunging into new skills for the love of them is fundamentally hopeful, even transcendent. “The more I feel imperfect,” she writes, “the more I feel alive.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/the-terrible-downside-of-ai-language-translation/674687/">Read: Learn a foreign language before it&#39;s too late</a><br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/beyond-a-boundary-c-l-r-james/9780822355632?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Beyond a Boundary</em></strong></a> <strong>, by CLR James</strong><br><br> James, the Trinidadian scholar, might best be known for his Marxist writings and his advocacy for Caribbean independence. Less known is his obsession with cricket. James spent a lifetime steeped in the sport: He disappointed his family by focusing on the game rather than schoolwork, played for a first-class club on Trinidad, and eventually covered cricket as a journalist in England. He even credits the sport for his activism. “Cricket,” he writes, “had plunged me into politics long before I was aware of it”—in part because class and race tensions on the island played out among its socially stratified clubs. <em>Beyond a Boundary</em> makes the case that cricket is impossible to understand without considering its historical, social, and cultural context; in the book&#39;s most ambitious moments, it argues for cricket&#39;s foundational place in modern British history and for its status as a dramatic and visual art. Even if you know nothing about the sport, James conveys its richness—how a batter&#39;s style can reflect both individual personality and a society&#39;s priorities, and how the game effortlessly connects its followers with the wider world.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/onward-and-upward-in-the-garden-katherine-s-white/9781590178508?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Onward and Upward in the Garden</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Katharine S. White</strong><br><br> White describes her gardening habits as “careless,” “lazy,” and “amateur,” but the critical eye and exacting taste that come through in her collected gardening columns for <em>The New Yorker</em> are a delight. White was that magazine&#39;s first fiction editor—she was an early publisher of many famous writers, including EB White, her future husband—and in these columns she delivers crisp assessments of gardening books and seed catalogs from 1958 to 1970, considering not only their prose but ease of use, typography, paper quality, and color reproduction. Scattered throughout are glimpses of a life suffused with flowers. In winter, she moves through a house crowded with plants, worrying about the location of the cyclamens and the temperature of the African violets. Once, she informs us, she tried to grow lilies in her frozen Maine garden, which resulted in “the comic spectacle of me and my eager family attacking a flower border with a crowbar.” Her opinions about bearded irises and gourds, dahlias and gladioli are all expressed with such humor and charisma that I couldn&#39;t help dreaming of what a garden of my own might look like.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2020/09/teaching-healing-power-garden-class/616198/">Read: The healing power of garden class</a><br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-shepherd-s-life-modern-dispatches-from-an-ancient-landscape-james-rebanks/9781250060266?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>The Shepherd&#39;s Life</em></strong></a> <strong>, by James Rebanks</strong><br><br> Cast your mind&#39;s eye over the verdant mountains of England&#39;s Lake District, and you might think of Wordsworth and the Romantic poets writing paeans to wildernesses untouched by man. Rebanks, a shepherd whose family has lived on that land for centuries, rebuts these poetic images of his home. “Every acre of it,” he writes in his thought-provoking memoir, “has been defined by the actions of men and women over the past ten thousand years.” The author makes the care and maintenance of sheep utterly absorbing, conjuring the coordinated pincer movement the shepherds perform every summer to gather their sheep from the mountaintops and the nerve-racking work of birthing lambs in the spring, which sometimes requires reaching in with one&#39;s bare hands. By the end, selecting which rams to mate with your ewes begins to seem like a high-stakes artistic decision. Rebanks positions his portrait of traditional farming as a counterpoint to modern life (he finds a stint at Oxford largely “pointless and empty”). His compelling critique invites readers to seek out more rooted, time-honored ways to live.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/what-i-talk-about-when-i-talk-about-running-a-memoir-haruki-murakami/9780307389831?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>What I Talk About When I Talk About Running</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Haruki Murakami</strong><br><br> This classic avocational memoir follows Murakami as he trains for the 2005 New York City Marathon and reflects on a life of serious running. The book verges on self-help—chapter titles include “Suffering Is Optional” and “Most of What I Know About Writing Fiction I Learned by Running Every Day”—but the aura of upbeat resignation that colors the proceedings alters its tone. “Life is basically unfair,” Murakami writes. “But even in a situation that&#39;s unfair, I think it&#39;s possible to seek out a kind of fairness.” You simply can&#39;t control what happens on race day, just as Murakami can&#39;t control his aging body and slower finishing times, much less the stubborn, avoidant personality he&#39;s carried around “like an old suitcase.” This book is refreshingly free of exhortations for everyone to take up running. (The author in fact believes forcing people to do it is “pointless torture,” which, yes.) But the scenes of him jogging through Kauai or Cambridge, Massachusetts, thinking of nothing but crisp morning air and “the sounds of my footsteps, my breathing and heartbeats, all blended together in a unique polyrhythm,” are their own kind of persuasion.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-2189-mile-marathon/559112/">Read:</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/the-2189-mile-marathon/559112/">The wisdom of running a 2,189-mile marathon</a><br><br> <strong><em>A Degree of Mastery</em></strong> <strong>, by Annie Tremmel Wilcox</strong><br><br> The first section of <em>A Degree of Mastery</em> flings the reader straight into the deep end of book conservation, and it is utterly engrossing. Wilcox slices the spine off of a deteriorating book printed in 1817, disassembles the binding, and then literally washes the pages in a bath of deionized water. She meticulously mends rips with a Japanese wheat-starch paste, prepared in a device called a Cook &#39;n&#39; Stir. I learned names for parts of books I didn&#39;t know had names: That striped cord attached to the spine of hardcover books, for instance, is an endband. In 1987, Wilcox became the first female apprentice of the renowned book conservator William Anthony, before his death from liver cancer. Her memoir details life at a workbench in the University of Iowa Libraries&#39; conservation department, where she picks up bookbinding by doctoring 15th-century incunabula and editions of <em>Leaves of Grass</em> under Anthony&#39;s patient eye. It&#39;s also a moving meditation on the nature of apprenticeship, on the mutual learning that occurs among a craft&#39;s practitioners, and on the teachers who live on through students who espouse their knowledge and ideals.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-curse-of-the-boyfriend-sweater-essays-on-crafting-alanna-okun/9781250095633?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>The Curse of the Boyfriend Sweater</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Alanna Okun</strong><br><br> Most people, Okun asserts, become engrossed in hobbies because they&#39;re seeking a specific kind of satisfaction: “that small but constant motion that helps them metabolize the universe and comprises a corner of their identity.” Some play musical instruments; some fish. Okun&#39;s preferred activity is knitting, a lifelong pursuit, as well as crochet and embroidery, all of which create <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/04/crafts-coronavirus-quarantine-stress-relief/609187/">safe havens for her from an often-overwhelming world</a> . In these strikingly vulnerable essays, knitting baby cardigans and crocheting gargantuan blankets aren&#39;t just pleasant diversions but emotional lifelines while Okun contends with her grief over the death of two friends and her grandparents, as well as the agonies of romance and her struggles with anxiety. “A craft project,” Okun writes, “allows you to hold something concrete in your hands even while everything around you is swirling and illegible.” Crafting is also, she makes clear, extremely fun. Okun brings her knitting on the subway and to the beach, and makes witty lists of the skills she&#39;s gained from her fiber-art endeavors. Through her eyes, we see the infinite potential of “a large pile of marled green wool, three balls of unbleached cotton, a tiny skein of silk.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/lifelong-learning-new-skill-book-recommendations/674807/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/lifelong-learning-new-skill-book-recommendations/674807/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Perfect Service to Make Everyone at the Airport Hate You]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The identification company Clear allows travelers to pay to cut in line.

Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> With sincere apologies, I need to ask you to imagine yourself arriving at the airport. Freshly expelled from whatever mode of transport brought you there, you are probably at least a little bit harried. Maybe you&#39;re running late or you&#39;re wrangling small children. Maybe you are weighed down by an overstuffed tote bag and a roll-aboard that could burst at any moment because you are opposed in principle to paying $50 to check a bag. The stink of anxiety sweat has begun to emanate from your person.<br><br> Waiting for you once you enter is the center of much airport melodrama: the TSA line. What you will encounter there is anyone&#39;s guess. You might hand over your ID to an agent and swing your bag onto the luggage scanner&#39;s belt near instantly, or hundreds of people might be in line in front of you. Can your laptop go in the same bin as your purse? Is your cardigan a shirt that you can continue wearing, or is it a jacket that needs to be removed? You&#39;ll find out when you find out, usually when someone with a badge yells at you.<br><br> Travel can be one of life&#39;s great joys, but the airport is, at its absolute best, a necessary obstacle to the eventual reward of visiting loved ones or experiencing a new place. At worst, it&#39;s a “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/laguardia-airport-redevelopment-american-infrastructure-lesson/673015/">ghastly purgatory</a> ,” in the words of my colleague Ian Bogost, riven with long waits, bad food, surprise fees, cramped quarters, spontaneous schedule changes, and lots of people acting like absolute unsocialized freaks. All of this chaos is subject to strict surveillance and regulation, and almost everything that happens once you enter an airport is out of your control.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/05/psychological-reason-people-are-late-airport/590500/">Read: There are two types of airport people</a><br><br> But what if you could wrest some of that control back? That&#39;s the promise behind Clear, whose employees you&#39;ve likely encountered in the past few years while flying: They&#39;re the smiling faces in neat checked shirts standing in front of a bank of sleek white consoles. They&#39;re friendlier than most TSA agents, and they&#39;ve got a deal to offer you: Fork over your ID, let them scan your eyeballs, pay nothing today, and they&#39;ll whisk you to the front of the line. Even if you&#39;ve never taken the bait yourself, you&#39;ve probably seen Clear employees pick off a few late-arriving travelers from the back of the line you&#39;re already waiting in. Maybe you&#39;ve even had the service&#39;s subscribers inserted in front of you just as it was your turn to pass through the checkpoint, violating a rule of civil society so basic that the average preschooler knows it: Cutting in line is wrong, and the people who have waited the longest should go next.<br><br> Clear is a strange phenomenon. It is in some ways similar to—and operates alongside—TSA PreCheck, the federal government&#39;s own paid-clearance service that ferries travelers more efficiently through airport screening. But unlike PreCheck, it&#39;s an independent, private company, woven into airports&#39; disorienting economy along with Hudson News and Dunkin&#39;. At its core, Clear is a biometric-data company, and the dismal experience of getting on an airplane has helped it do what few biometrics start-ups have managed to do: persuade millions of eager consumers to hand over their personal information and an annual fee. Lots of those start-ups aspire to turn your index finger or eyeball into an ID or a credit card, among other things, but Clear may be the one that&#39;s gotten closest to making that tech-industry dream a reality.<br><br> Clear is something else too. The service exists because American air travel is a needlessly punishing process, and navigating security is one of its worst bottlenecks. The enormous, intractable hassle of the airport has proved to be fertile ground for private-sector services designed to make the process of getting on a plane marginally more bearable. As travel rates surge, the airport, already heavily mediated by private-sector perks for high-spenders, has only become more stuffed with premium services and elite conveniences. When everything is a perk, what&#39;s left of the public good?<br><br> Like many things about contemporary American air travel, Clear&#39;s presence in airports is an indirect result of 9/11. Its predecessor, Verified Identity Pass, or VIP, was founded in the aftermath of the attacks, when the federal government was looking for companies that could expedite security procedures for people who flew a lot and were regarded as a low security risk, such as business travelers. VIP&#39;s signature product—confusingly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.epic.org/privacy/airtravel/clear/">also called Clear</a> —gathered about 200,000 clients before the company filed for bankruptcy, in 2009. At that point, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onezero.medium.com/clear-conquered-u-s-airports-now-it-wants-to-own-your-entire-digital-identity-15d61076e44d">according to a 2020 story on Clear</a> by the journalist Dave Gershgorn, it was bought by a duo of former hedge-fund managers who envisioned a life beyond government contracting for their new service.<br><br> VIP was rebranded to Clear, and the company, which had previously issued express-pass cards to its members, pivoted to biometrics. To sign up for Clear&#39;s marquee offering, Clear Plus, the company scans your irises and fingerprints, verifies your identity, and charges a $189-a-year fee after the initial free month for people who sign up at the airport. For that price, you get escorted to the front of the security line at the 52 North American airports where the company currently operates. If you have both Clear and TSA PreCheck, the service puts you at the front of the PreCheck line, so you can also keep your shoes on.<br><br> For anyone who doesn&#39;t have Clear Plus, the sales pitches and line-cutting can be pretty annoying. Clear&#39;s argument is that its services help security run more smoothly for all travelers. In an email, a company spokesperson, Annabel Walsh, described Clear as a “force multiplier” for airport efficiency: Travelers who get verified via Clear don&#39;t need to have their IDs checked by TSA, which frees up agents to check others. Airports also permit Clear salespeople to pull double duty by answering questions for travelers, Walsh told me. This appears to have upsides for both the company and the airport: Low pay and difficult work make attracting and retaining airport staff a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/economy/airports-have-always-had-trouble-attracting-workers-expect-longer-lines-n1272540">constant struggle</a> , so Clear salespeople can theoretically fill in some customer-assistance gaps while also finding solid opportunities to pitch their product. When someone signs up, the airport gets a cut of their subscription fee, which, according to Gershgorn&#39;s investigation, can add up to millions of dollars a year. (Walsh did not confirm this amount when asked.)<br><br> Walsh told me that Clear&#39;s programs currently have 16 million members. Not all of them pay for the line-jumping ease of Clear Plus: The company offers free programs—including one that allows you to reserve a time to go through security at some airports, and another that provides an express lane to get into some stadiums and arenas—that anyone can use after downloading a free app and uploading a selfie. Meanwhile, many of Clear Plus&#39;s members join because the program has become a common feature in the elite tiers of consumer-loyalty programs. Delta and United, which have both invested in Clear, will cover all or part of the Clear Plus fee for frequent fliers, and American Express Platinum cardholders get a full statement credit for a solo membership. Although Walsh adamantly opposed the idea that Clear could be regarded as a <em>perk</em> instead of a <em>vital bit of security infrastructure</em> , it is indeed a pretty popular perk.<br><br> As Clear&#39;s move into stadiums and arenas suggests, the company&#39;s biggest ambitions span beyond air travel. Clear wants to expand its verification technologies into other domains of modern life that require waiting and fumbling around for identification. In particular, the company has designs on the health-care industry. Earlier in the pandemic, Clear developed a free service to verify members&#39; vaccination status and recent test results, and Walsh told me that in the future, Clear verification could be used to do things like unlock a patient&#39;s medical records, insurance card, and co-pay; the company is currently working on such a system with University of Miami Health. Clear, or a company like it, could one day function as a one-stop shop for your personal identity, a middleman between you and the government, your doctor, your professional licensing, and potentially much more. Instead of getting your insurance card out of your wallet or tapping your phone against a card reader to use Apple Pay, all of it would be contained within your fingerprint.<br><br> For whatever company that manages to make all of this a widely adopted reality, there is significant upside to be gained—not only in contracting for the services themselves and selling memberships to use them, but potentially also in the treasure trove of data collected. The minute details of your travel habits, medical history, event attendance, and purchases, all compiled into a single user profile with a verified identity, can be worth a lot of money. Clear is adamant that the company does not and will not sell or give any user data to third parties without permission from individual users. Even so, as Gershgorn points out, many major tech companies that take in massive amounts of revenue through advertisements do not technically sell user data to third parties either. Facebook, for instance, sells access to pools of consumers who meet an advertiser&#39;s desired demographic criteria through ad targeting.<br><br> Walsh told me that the only thing Clear uses member data for is to provide services to its members, and that it does not monetize its data through promotional targeting. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.clearme.com/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a> that governs Clear&#39;s services would at least seem to allow it, however. The policy stipulates that Clear may use everything but its biometric and health data to conduct marketing and consumer research, contact members about products and services from its marketing partners, and “offer our consumers products or services we believe may be of interest to them.” Walsh defended the policy, saying it “allows Clear to keep our members informed about new Clear services, and helps us prioritize what new services to build for our members.”<br><br> Feeling a little creeped out by Clear is easy, no matter how widely its employees smile at you as you slog toward your gate. There are many arguments against data collection, but the main one is pretty simple: The more companies know about you, the easier it becomes for them to manipulate you in weak moments or part you from your money. If you&#39;ve ever been buried under ads about wedding vendors or baby products after a little light googling that might imply you&#39;re newly engaged or pregnant, then you know how readily these unseen forces can discern the most intimate details of your life. Wariness of these practices is a big reason so many biometrics companies have a difficult time finding eager customers. If the value proposition is the ability to pay with your fingerprint in exchange for all of your personal data, you might rightly decide that it&#39;s not that hard to tap a credit card or your phone against a reader.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/airport-bars-drinking-morning/674322/">Read: It&#39;s 5 am somewhere</a><br><br> That said, commercial life in America has shown time and again that people tend to be happy to relinquish all kinds of personal information for the right amount of convenience. The fact that Clear has amassed millions of members makes a fairly convincing case that traversing American airport security is simply <em>that grim</em> ; people are ready to skip the line, fingerprints be damned. In this regard, Clear&#39;s close ties with consumer-loyalty programs makes particular sense. Loyalty programs are one of the most popular ways to make personal-data gathering palatable to the general public: You agree to have your behavior tracked under a unique identifier such as a frequent-flier number, then you get discounts or conveniences or special perks. Many people might not even realize the bargain they&#39;re making, but many others seem perfectly fine with it. If you can save a little on your grocery bill, who cares if Kroger has a slightly easier time tracking what you&#39;ve purchased?<br><br> Skepticism, in other words, might not be a real issue for Clear. Instead, their biggest hurdle might actually be the opposite: a rush for any services that attempt to game the airport&#39;s system. By finding advantage in the chaos of American airline travel, Clear has entered an arms race that might not be winnable, for it or anyone else. The nature of the company&#39;s business means that it always has to remain a step ahead of the airport crowd. If that crowd catches up, Clear will be overwhelmed by the infrastructural flaws on top of which it&#39;s built—a phenomenon that only helps generate more new private-sector services to make things a little less bad for the people who fly the most.<br><br> Gary Leff, an airline-industry expert and the founder of the travel website View From the Wing, told me that for years, airline watchers have been asking the TSA to make simple changes that they argue would speed up the screening process without compromising safety—ending the war on carry-on liquids, allowing small scissors, letting people keep their shoes on and leave their laptops in their bags. These changes would address the bottlenecks where they&#39;re most likely to happen: not at the ID checkpoint from which Clear Plus exempts its members, but from the part immediately after that, where you and all your belongings get a visual once-over. They&#39;d also be free and benefit all travelers. TSA has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2011/09/07/140240633/for-now-shoes-still-come-off-at-airport-security">maintained</a> that the procedures in place are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fodors.com/news/news/will-the-u-s-change-its-3-1-1-liquid-rule-on-flights">essential</a> for safety. These kinds of changes tend to become political footballs, which makes it difficult to do anything that could be construed as too permissive. It&#39;s even more difficult, according to Leff, to get the kinds of changes that would make the biggest difference in your experience at the airport—namely, more funding for the woefully understaffed Federal Aviation Administration and for capital improvements at America&#39;s aging airports.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/laguardia-airport-redevelopment-american-infrastructure-lesson/673015/">Read: America built an actually good airport</a><br><br> So instead, occasional fliers suffer through unpredictable security lines, and frequent travelers arbitrage airline and credit-card perks. Their frustration is legible in the popularity of TSA PreCheck, which costs $78 for a five-year membership: By early 2022, the number of members in the Department of Homeland Security&#39;s Trusted Traveler programs (most of whom are PreCheck users) had increased 44 percent from before the pandemic, to nearly 30 million people, according to the travel site<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thepointsguy.com/news/tsa-precheck-more-members/"><em>The Points Guy</em></a> . That popularity is also something of an Achilles heel. The program&#39;s members may have their own line, but it&#39;s subject to the same issues of understaffing and aging infrastructure as all the others, and the more people use the program, the more the PreCheck line looks like the regular one.<br><br> The thing about perks is that people pursue them. Catering to people who fly constantly has a way of making a service crowded, because, well, those people are at the airport all the time. As Clear has grown, it&#39;s encountered some of the same issues as PreCheck. Namely, you might find yourself once again having to wait, this time to have your iris or fingertip scanned. Leff, who told me he&#39;s a longtime, mostly satisfied Clear member, said that since travel volume has picked up again after the height of the pandemic, he sometimes just gets his ID out and goes to the PreCheck line because it looks like it&#39;ll be faster than waiting to check in with Clear. (Walsh told me that on average, Clear members wait for less than five minutes.)<br><br> Infrastructural bottlenecks like TSA can&#39;t be solved with private-sector services, because all you&#39;re really doing is temporarily outrunning the crowd. Eventually, even with an expensive service like Clear, too many people will catch up, and the problem underlying it all still won&#39;t be fixed. “The more people who have access to it, the longer the lines you&#39;re going to face,” Leff said. “At some level, it&#39;s potentially just a temporary reprieve.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 20:55:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/clear-airport-security-lines-tsa-infrastructure/674809/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/clear-airport-security-lines-tsa-infrastructure/674809/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ticks Are Winning]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Their saliva is a secret weapon. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/UrzkYZixYduVStPocLpnoGefvsE=/0x0:1767x994/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_1036497574/original.jpg" alt="透过绿叶背面看到的蜱虫轮廓，叶脉可见" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Patrick Pleul / picture alliance / Getty</figcaption></figure> In the three-plus decades I&#39;ve been alive, I have never been bitten by a tick. Actually, that may be a lie, and I have no way of knowing for sure. Because even though ticks have harpoonlike mouthparts, even though certain species can latch on for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7355616/">up to two weeks</a> , even though some guzzle enough blood to swell 100 times in weight, their bites are disturbingly discreet. “As a kid, I would have hundreds of ticks on me,” at least several of which would bite, says Adela Oliva Chavez, a tick researcher at Texas A&amp;M University. And yet she would never notice until her aunt would pick them off her skin.<br><br> The secret behind tick stealth is tick <em>saliva</em> —a strange, slippery, and multifaceted fluid with no biological peer <em>.</em> It keeps the pests&#39; bites bizarrely itch- and pain-free, and allows them to feed unimpeded by their hosts&#39; immunity. As climate change remodels the world, spit is also what&#39;s helping ticks enter new habitats and hosts—bringing with them the many deadly viruses, bacteria, and parasites they so often import.<br><br> For all their dependency on blood, ticks almost never eat. In their sometimes-multiyear life span, they may feed only once in each stage: larva, nymph, and adult. Which means, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/07/the-marvels-of-tick-saliva/594652/">as my colleague Sarah Zhang once wrote, each meal must count for an awful lot.</a> Unlike mosquitoes and other bloodsucking bugs that can get away with a dine and dash, ticks must linger on flesh for days or even weeks—an extended feast that requires them to essentially graft onto the host&#39;s body like a temporary limb.<br><br> For the entirety of that process, saliva is key. When a tick first bites, its spit lines the wound with a gluelike substance that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30459085/">cements its mouth in place</a> . Once secure, the tick deploys <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00281/full">a fleet of spit-borne compounds</a> that dilate its host&#39;s vessels, while simultaneously battling the bodily compounds that would normally prompt the injury to clot, heal, or tingle with pain or itch. Under most circumstances, such an onslaught of foreign molecules would instantly marshal the body&#39;s immune cavalry. But ticks have workarounds for that too. Their saliva is an anti-inflammatory and an analgesic; it can disable the alarms that cells send to one another, preventing them from coordinating an attack. Spit can even reprogram immune cells so that they never complete their development or receive the cues they need to gather at the scene.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/02/ticks-can-take-down-800-pound-moose/583189/">Read: Climate change enters its blood-sucking phase</a><br><br> All of these strategies can also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2021.816547/full">ease the way</a> for bacteria, viruses, and parasites that the tick swallows from one host, then deposits into the next. With tick saliva breaching the skin barrier and keeping the immune system in check, all the pathogens have to do is come along for the ride. “Tick saliva is like a luxury vehicle that delivers them to the site of infection and rolls out the red carpet,” says Seemay Chou, the CEO of the biotech start-up Arcadia Science. Studies have shown that multiple pathogens get an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/jvi.01056-15">infectious</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10118219/">boost</a> when chauffeured by spit, spilling more efficiently into the skin of newly bitten hosts. <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> , the bacterium that causes Lyme disease, will even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8001052/">slather parts of tick saliva onto itself like a cloak</a> , essentially rendering itself <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4306560/">invisible to bodily defense</a> . Ticks&#39; infectious cargo may even egg each other on: Saravanan Thangamani, at Upstate Medical University, in New York, has found evidence that ticks <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/7/1584">simultaneously carrying <em>Borrelia</em> and Powassan virus</a> may end up injecting <em>more</em> of the latter into fresh wounds.<br><br> Already, ticks spread <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6024845/">more pathogens</a> to humans and their livestock than any other insect or arachnid. And the risks ticks pose may only be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-ento-052720-094533">growing</a> , as warming temperatures and human meddling with wildlife allow them to expand their geographic range and infiltrate new hosts. In North America, lone-star ticks and black-legged ticks have been orchestrating a concerted march north into Canada. At the same time, the <em>percentage</em> of ticks carrying infections is also increasing, Thangamani told me, and for decades now, case counts of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis in several parts of the world have been on a steady rise. As cold seasons shrink, the periods of the year when ticks bite—usually, the warmest months—are expanding too. “Many, many places are getting filled up with ticks,” says Jean Tsao, an entomologist at Michigan State University. “And they&#39;re going to get more.”<br><br> It helps that many ticks aren&#39;t picky about whom they carry or bite. Some species, as they push into new places, have picked up new pathogens in the past few years—Bourbon virus, heartland virus—that pose additional threats to us. Many tick species are also relatively indiscriminate about their hosts: Within its lifetime, a single deer tick may “feed very happily on reptiles, avians, and birds,” says Pat Nuttall, a virologist and tick researcher at the University of Oxford. Their spit is intricate enough that it can be tailored to counteract the defenses of each species in turn. Transfer a tick from a rabbit to a human or a dog, Oliva Chavez told me, and it will take notice—and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcimb.2017.00517/full">adjust its saliva</a> , quite literally to taste.<br><br> Vaccines to combat Lyme and other tick-borne diseases have long been in development. But many researchers think the more efficient tactic is going after the tick itself—a strategy that could, at best, “stop the transmission of several pathogens at once,” says Girish Neelakanta, a tick biologist at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville. Anti-tick immunity is possible: Studies have documented <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34074602/">guinea pigs, cattle, rabbits, goats, and dogs</a> developing sustained defenses against the arachnids after they&#39;ve been bitten over and over again—even reactions that can help the animals detect a bite immediately, and sweep the pest away.<br><br> But spit is a slippery target for bodily defenses to hit. The substance doesn&#39;t just shut down immune responses. It also reformulates itself constantly so that it can keep evading the host&#39;s defenses—as often as every few hours, faster than most of the immune system can keep track. By the time the body has prepped an assault on one salivary ingredient, the tick has almost certainly swapped it out for the next. “It&#39;s a game that the tick is playing, a catch-me-if-you-can kind of thing,” says Sukanya Narasimhan, a tick researcher at Yale. To outcompete the tick&#39;s tricks, Narasimhan thinks it will be key to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/sukanya-narasimhan/?tab=research">develop a vaccine</a> that triggers the body to respond to tick bites <em>fast</em> , “as soon as a tick attaches,” she said, ideally by targeting the saliva&#39;s first ingredients.<br><br> As ticks continue their takeover, it&#39;s hard not to develop at least some grudging respect for their pluck. Some scientists even think that studying, or perhaps <em>mimicking</em> , their saliva could lead to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2019.00812/full">other breakthroughs</a> . Copycatting the spit&#39;s immunosuppressive tendencies could be useful for the treatment of asthma, or for drugs that assist in organ transplants; imitating its anticoagulant properties could help keep life-threatening clots at bay. Some tick-saliva ingredients have even prompted investigations into their potential as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214750018305468?via%3Dihub">cancer</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13318-018-0500-z">therapy</a> . Ticks, after all, have been studying mammalian bodies for millions of years, all in hopes of subterfuge; under their tutelage, Chou, the Arcadia Science CEO, hopes to learn more about the molecular pathways that drive the urge to itch.<br><br><br> Ticks aren&#39;t invincible, though, and some of the same global changes now easing their entry into new habitats could eventually hinder their progress. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6262408/climate-change-lyme-disease-ticks/">Already</a> , they are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/jme/article/58/4/1536/5942051">fleeing parts of the planet</a> that have grown too hot, too humid, too flooded, too razed with wildfires for them or their preferred hosts to survive, including certain inhospitable <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168723">pockets of the American South</a> . A tick decline could be good for us. But it would also be a symptom of a planetary scourge that has grown worse. Ticks, undoubtedly, “will continue to adapt,” Thangamani told me. And yet they, too, have their limits—further, but not that much further, beyond our own.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 24 Jul 2023 14:36:37 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tick-bite-saliva-infection-spread/674804/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tick-bite-saliva-infection-spread/674804/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Does Sam Altman Know What He’s Creating?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The OpenAI CEO&#39;s ambitious, ingenious, terrifying quest to create a new form of intelligence <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/4bX2g65va3VcwJO-qx1nrFJwQrg=/13x50:1028x1318/648x810/media/img/2023/07/20/WEL_Andersen_OpenAiBrain-1/original.png" alt="紫色背景下具有向不同方向拉伸的线状股的抽象大脑的插图" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Ricardo Rey</figcaption></figure> <span class="smallcaps">On a Monday morning</span> in April, Sam Altman sat inside OpenAI&#39;s San Francisco headquarters, telling me about a dangerous artificial intelligence that his company had built but would never release. His employees, he later said, often lose sleep worrying about the AIs they might one day release without fully appreciating their dangers. With his heel perched on the edge of his swivel chair, he looked relaxed. The powerful AI that his company <i>had</i> released in November had captured the world&#39;s imagination like nothing in tech&#39;s recent history. There was grousing in some quarters about the things ChatGPT could not yet do well, and in others about the future it may portend, but Altman wasn&#39;t sweating it; this was, for him, a moment of triumph.<br><br> In small doses, Altman&#39;s large blue eyes emit a beam of earnest intellectual attention, and he seems to understand that, in large doses, their intensity might unsettle. In this case, he was willing to chance it: He wanted me to know that whatever AI&#39;s ultimate risks turn out to be, he has zero regrets about letting ChatGPT loose into the world. To the contrary, he believes it was a great public service.<br><br> “We could have gone off and just built this in our building here for five more years,” he said, “and we would have had something jaw-dropping.” But the public wouldn&#39;t have been able to prepare for the shock waves that followed, an outcome that he finds “deeply unpleasant to imagine.” Altman believes that people need time to reckon with the idea that we may soon share Earth with a powerful new intelligence, before it remakes everything from work to human relationships. ChatGPT was a way of serving notice.<br><br> In 2015, Altman, Elon Musk, and several prominent AI researchers founded OpenAI because they believed that an artificial general intelligence—something as intellectually capable, say, as a typical college grad—was at last within reach. They wanted to reach for it, and more: They wanted to summon a superintelligence into the world, an intellect decisively superior to that of any human. And whereas a big tech company might recklessly rush to get there first, for its own ends, they wanted to do it safely, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai">to benefit humanity as a whole</a> .” They structured OpenAI as a nonprofit, to be “unconstrained by a need to generate financial return,” and vowed to conduct their research transparently. There would be no retreat to a top-secret lab in the New Mexico desert.<br><br> <small><i>This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i>, Monday through Friday.</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1687281150220000&amp;usg=AOvVaw05QTN9B-v3iPzpuAwX1i31" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" target="_blank"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a> <i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></small><br><br> For years, the public didn&#39;t hear much about OpenAI. When Altman became CEO in 2019, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.semafor.com/article/03/24/2023/the-secret-history-of-elon-musk-sam-altman-and-openai">reportedly after a power struggle with Musk</a> , it was barely a story. OpenAI published papers, including one that same year about a new AI. That got the full attention of the Silicon Valley tech community, but the technology&#39;s potential was not apparent to the general public until last year, when people began to play with ChatGPT.<br><br> The engine that now powers ChatGPT is called GPT-4. Altman described it to me as an alien intelligence. Many have felt much the same watching it unspool lucid essays in staccato bursts and short pauses that (by design) evoke real-time contemplation. In its few months of existence, it has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/04/chatgpt-generative-ai-reliability-creativity-grocery-list/673759/">suggested novel cocktail recipes</a> , according to its own theory of flavor combinations; composed an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/chatbot-cheating-college-campuses/674073/">untold number of college papers</a> , throwing educators into despair; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/02/chatgpt-ai-technology-writing-poetry/673035/">written poems in a range of styles</a> , sometimes well, always quickly; and passed the Uniform Bar Exam. It makes factual errors, but it will charmingly admit to being wrong. Altman can still remember where he was the first time he saw GPT-4 write complex computer code, an ability for which it was not explicitly designed. “It was like, &#39;Here we are,&#39; ” he said.<br><br> Within nine weeks of ChatGPT&#39;s release, it had reached an estimated 100 million monthly users, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/chatgpt-sets-record-fastest-growing-user-base-analyst-note-2023-02-01/">according to a UBS study</a> , likely making it, at the time, the most rapidly adopted consumer product in history. Its success roused tech&#39;s accelerationist id: Big investors and huge companies in the US and China quickly diverted tens of billions of dollars into R&amp;D modeled on OpenAI&#39;s approach. Metaculus, a prediction site, has for years tracked forecasters&#39; guesses as to when an artificial general intelligence would arrive. Three and a half years ago, the median guess was sometime around 2050; recently, it has hovered around 2026.<br><br> I was visiting OpenAI to understand the technology that allowed the company to leapfrog the tech giants—and to understand what it might mean for human civilization if someday soon a superintelligence materializes in one of the company&#39;s cloud servers. Ever since the computing revolution&#39;s earliest hours, AI has been mythologized as a technology destined to bring about a profound rupture. Our culture has generated an entire imaginarium of AIs that end history in one way or another. Some are godlike beings that wipe away every tear, healing the sick and repairing our relationship with the Earth, before they usher in an eternity of frictionless abundance and beauty. Others reduce all but an elite few of us to gig serfs, or drive us to extinction.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">From the June 2023 issue: Never give artificial intelligence the nuclear codes</a><br><br> Altman has entertained the most far-out scenarios. “When I was a younger adult,” he said, “I had this fear, anxiety … and, to be honest, 2 percent of excitement mixed in, too, that we were going to create this thing” that “was going to far surpass us,” and “it was going to go off, colonize the universe, and humans were going to be left to the solar system.”<br><br> “As a nature reserve?” I asked.<br><br> “Exactly,” he said. “And that now strikes me as so naive.”<br><br> Across several conversations in the United States and Asia, Altman laid out his new vision of the AI future in his excitable midwestern patter. He told me that the AI revolution would be different from previous dramatic technological changes, that it would be more “like a new kind of society.” He said that he and his colleagues have spent a lot of time thinking about AI&#39;s social implications, and what the world is going to be like “on the other side.”<br><br> But the more we talked, the more indistinct that other side seemed. Altman, who is 38, is the most powerful person in AI development today; his views, dispositions, and choices may matter greatly to the future we will all inhabit, more, perhaps, than those of the US president. But by his own admission, that future is uncertain and beset with serious dangers. Altman doesn&#39;t know how powerful AI will become, or what its ascendance will mean for the average person, or whether it will put humanity at risk. I don&#39;t hold that against him, exactly—I don&#39;t think anyone knows where this is all going, except that we&#39;re going there fast, whether or not we should be. Of that, Altman convinced me.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">OpenAI&#39;s headquarters</span> are in a four-story former factory in the Mission District, beneath the fog-wreathed Sutro Tower. Enter its lobby from the street, and the first wall you encounter is covered by a mandala, a spiritual representation of the universe, fashioned from circuits, copper wire, and other materials of computation. To the left, a secure door leads into an open-plan maze of handsome blond woods, elegant tile work, and other hallmarks of billionaire chic. Plants are ubiquitous, including hanging ferns and an impressive collection of extra-large bonsai, each the size of a crouched gorilla. The office was packed every day that I was there, and unsurprisingly, I didn&#39;t see anyone who looked older than 50. Apart from a two-story library complete with sliding ladder, the space didn&#39;t look much like a research laboratory, because the thing being built exists only in the cloud, at least for now. It looked more like the world&#39;s most expensive West Elm.<br><br> One morning I met with Ilya Sutskever, OpenAI&#39;s chief scientist. Sutskever, who is 37, has the affect of a mystic, sometimes to a fault: Last year he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://futurism.com/the-byte/openai-already-sentient">caused a small brouhaha</a> by claiming that GPT-4 may be “slightly conscious.” He first made his name as a star student of Geoffrey Hinton, the University of Toronto professor emeritus who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/01/technology/ai-google-chatbot-engineer-quits-hinton.html">resigned from Google this spring</a> so that he could speak more freely about AI&#39;s danger to humanity.<br><br> Hinton is sometimes described as the “Godfather of AI” because he grasped the power of “deep learning” earlier than most. In the 1980s, shortly after Hinton completed his Ph.D., the field&#39;s progress had all but come to a halt. Senior researchers were still coding top-down AI systems: AIs would be programmed with an exhaustive set of interlocking rules—about language, or the principles of geology or of medical diagnosis—in the hope that someday this approach would add up to human-level cognition. Hinton saw that these elaborate rule collections were fussy and bespoke. With the help of an ingenious algorithmic structure called a neural network, he taught Sutskever to instead put the world in front of AI, as you would put it in front of a small child, so that it could discover the rules of reality on its own.<br><br> Altman has compared early-stage AI research to teaching a human baby. But during OpenAI&#39;s first few years, no one knew whether they were training a baby or pursuing a spectacularly expensive dead end.<br><br> Sutskever described a neural network to me as beautiful and brainlike. At one point, he rose from the table where we were sitting, approached a whiteboard, and uncapped a red marker. He drew a crude neural network on the board and explained that the genius of its structure is that it learns, and its learning is powered by <i>prediction—</i> a bit like the scientific method. The neurons sit in layers. An input layer receives a chunk of data, a bit of text or an image, for example. The magic happens in the middle—or “hidden”—layers, which process the chunk of data, so that the output layer can spit out its prediction.<br><br> Imagine a neural network that has been programmed to predict the next word in a text. It will be preloaded with a gigantic number of possible words. But before it&#39;s trained, it won&#39;t yet have any experience in distinguishing among them, and so its predictions will be shoddy. If it is fed the sentence “The day after Wednesday is …” its initial output might be “purple.” A neural network learns because its training data include the correct predictions, which means it can grade its own outputs. When it sees the gulf between its answer, “purple,” and the correct answer, “Thursday,” it adjusts the connections among words in its hidden layers accordingly. Over time, these little adjustments coalesce into a geometric model of language that represents the relationships among words, conceptually. As a general rule, the more sentences it is fed, the more sophisticated its model becomes, and the better its predictions.<br><br> That&#39;s not to say that the path from the first neural networks to GPT-4&#39;s glimmers of humanlike intelligence was easy. Altman has compared early-stage AI research to teaching a human baby. “They take years to learn anything interesting,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">he told <i>The New Yorker</i> in 2016</a> , just as OpenAI was getting off the ground. “If AI researchers were developing an algorithm and stumbled across the one for a human baby, they&#39;d get bored watching it, decide it wasn&#39;t working, and shut it down.” The first few years at OpenAI were a slog, in part because no one there knew whether they were training a baby or pursuing a spectacularly expensive dead end.<br><br> “Nothing was working, and Google had everything: all the talent, all the people, all the money,” Altman told me. The founders had put up millions of dollars to start the company, and failure seemed like a real possibility. Greg Brockman, the 35-year-old president, told me that in 2017, he was so discouraged that he started lifting weights as a compensatory measure. He wasn&#39;t sure that OpenAI was going to survive the year, he said, and he wanted “to have something to show for my time.”<br><br> Neural networks were already doing intelligent things, but it wasn&#39;t clear which of them might lead to general intelligence. Just after OpenAI was founded, an AI called AlphaGo had stunned the world by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/03/the-invisible-opponent/475611/">beating Lee Se-dol at Go</a> , a game substantially more complicated than chess. Lee, the vanquished world champion, described AlphaGo&#39;s moves as “beautiful” and “creative.” Another top player said that they could never have been conceived by a human. OpenAI tried training an AI on <i>Dota 2</i> , a more complicated game still, involving multifront fantastical warfare in a three-dimensional patchwork of forests, fields, and forts. It eventually <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/13/18309459/openai-five-dota-2-finals-ai-bot-competition-og-e-sports-the-international-champion">beat the best human players</a> , but its intelligence never translated to other settings. Sutskever and his colleagues were like disappointed parents who had allowed their kids to play video games for thousands of hours against their better judgment.<br><br> In 2017, Sutskever began a series of conversations with an OpenAI research scientist named Alec Radford, who was working on natural-language processing. Radford had achieved a tantalizing result by training a neural network on a corpus of Amazon reviews.<br><br> The inner workings of ChatGPT—all of those mysterious things that happen in GPT-4&#39;s hidden layers—are too complex for any human to understand, at least with current tools. Tracking what&#39;s happening across the model—almost certainly composed of billions of neurons—is, today, hopeless. But Radford&#39;s model was simple enough to allow for understanding. When he looked into its hidden layers, he saw that it had devoted a special neuron to the <i>sentiment</i> of the reviews. Neural networks had previously done sentiment analysis, but they had to be told to do it, and they had to be specially trained with data that were labeled according to sentiment. This one had developed the capability on its own.<br><br> As a by-product of its simple task of predicting the next character in each word, Radford&#39;s neural network had modeled a larger structure of meaning in the world. Sutskever wondered whether one trained on more diverse language data could map many more of the world&#39;s structures of meaning. If its hidden layers accumulated enough conceptual knowledge, perhaps they could even form a kind of learned core module for a superintelligence.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s worth pausing</span> to understand why language is such a special information source. Suppose you are a fresh intelligence that pops into existence here on Earth. Surrounding you is the planet&#39;s atmosphere, the sun and Milky Way, and hundreds of billions of other galaxies, each one sloughing off light waves, sound vibrations, and all manner of other information. Language is different from these data sources. It isn&#39;t a direct physical signal like light or sound. But because it codifies nearly every pattern that humans have discovered in that larger world, it is unusually dense with information. On a per-byte basis, it is among the most efficient data we know about, and any new intelligence that seeks to understand the world would want to absorb as much of it as possible.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/06/henry-kissinger-ai-could-mean-the-end-of-human-history/559124/">From the June 2018 issue: Henry A. Kissinger on how human society is unprepared for the rise of AI</a><br><br> Sutskever told Radford to think bigger than Amazon reviews. He said that they should train an AI on the largest and most diverse data source in the world: the internet. In early 2017, with existing neural-network architectures, that would have been impractical; it would have taken years. But in June of that year, Sutskever&#39;s ex-colleagues at Google Brain published a working paper about a new neural-network architecture called the transformer. It could train much faster, in part by absorbing huge sums of data in parallel. “The next day, when the paper came out, we were like, &#39;That is the thing,&#39; ” Sutskever told me. “ &#39;It gives us everything we want.&#39; ”<br><br> One year later, in June 2018, OpenAI released GPT, a transformer model trained on more than 7,000 books. GPT didn&#39;t start with a basic book like <i>See Spot Run</i> and work its way up to Proust. It didn&#39;t even read books straight through. It absorbed random chunks of them simultaneously. Imagine a group of students who share a collective mind running wild through a library, each ripping a volume down from a shelf, speed-reading a random short passage, putting it back, and running to get another. They would predict word after word﻿﻿ as they went, sharpening their collective mind&#39;s linguistic instincts, until at last, weeks later, they&#39;d taken in every book.<br><br> GPT discovered many patterns in all those passages it read. You could tell it to finish a sentence. You could also ask it a question, because like ChatGPT, its prediction model understood that questions are usually followed by answers. Still, it was janky, more proof of concept than harbinger of a superintelligence. Four months later, Google released BERT, a suppler language model that got better press. But by then, OpenAI was already training a new model on a data set of more than 8 million webpages, each of which had cleared a minimum threshold of upvotes on Reddit—not the strictest filter, but perhaps better than no filter at all.<br><br> Sutskever wasn&#39;t sure how powerful GPT-2 would be after ingesting a body of text that would take a human reader centuries to absorb. He remembers playing with it just after it emerged from training, and being surprised by the raw model&#39;s language-translation skills. GPT-2 hadn&#39;t been trained to translate with paired language samples or any other digital Rosetta stones, the way Google Translate had been, and yet it seemed to understand how one language related to another. The AI had developed an emergent ability unimagined by its creators.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Researchers at other</span> AI labs—big and small—were taken aback by how much more advanced GPT-2 was than GPT. Google, Meta, and others quickly began to train larger language models. Altman, a St. Louis native, Stanford dropout, and serial entrepreneur, had previously led Silicon Valley&#39;s preeminent start-up accelerator, Y Combinator; he&#39;d seen plenty of young companies with a good idea get crushed by incumbents. To raise capital, OpenAI added <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp">a for-profit arm</a> , which now comprises more than 99 percent of the organization&#39;s head count. (Musk, who had by then left the company&#39;s board, has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=243&amp;v=bWr-DA5Wjfw&amp;feature=youtu.be">compared this move</a> to turning a rainforest-conservation organization into a lumber outfit.) Microsoft invested $1 billion soon after, and has reportedly invested <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/23/business/microsoft-chatgpt-artificial-intelligence.html">another $12 billion</a> since. OpenAI said that initial investors&#39; returns would be capped at 100 times the value of the original investment—with any overages going to education or other initiatives intended to benefit humanity—but the company would not confirm Microsoft&#39;s cap.<br><br> Altman and OpenAI&#39;s other leaders seemed confident that the restructuring would not interfere with the company&#39;s mission, and indeed would only accelerate its completion. Altman tends to take a rosy view of these matters. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://greylock.com/greymatter/sam-altman-ai-for-the-next-era/">a Q&amp;A last year</a> , he acknowledged that AI could be “really terrible” for society and said that we have to plan against the worst possibilities. But if you&#39;re doing that, he said, “you may as well emotionally feel like we&#39;re going to get to the great future, and work as hard as you can to get there.”<br><br> As for other changes to the company&#39;s structure and financing, he told me he draws the line at going public. “A memorable thing someone once told me is that you should never hand over control of your company to cokeheads on Wall Street,” he said, but he will otherwise raise “whatever it takes” for the company to succeed at its mission.<br><br> Whether or not OpenAI ever feels the pressure of a quarterly earnings report, the company now finds itself in a race against tech&#39;s largest, most powerful conglomerates to train models of increasing scale and sophistication—and to commercialize them for their investors. Earlier this year, Musk founded <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/martineparis/2023/04/16/elon-musk-launches-xai-to-fight-chatgpt-woke-ai-with-twitter-data/?sh=4c2ff9fd51f8">an AI lab of his own</a> —xAI—to compete with OpenAI. (“Elon is a super-sharp dude,” Altman said diplomatically when I asked him about the company. “I assume he&#39;ll do a good job there.”) Meanwhile, Amazon is revamping Alexa using much larger language models than it has in the past.<br><br> All of these companies are chasing high-end GPUs—the processors that power the supercomputers that train large neural networks. Musk has said that they are now “considerably harder to get than drugs.” Even with GPUs scarce, in recent years the scale of the largest AI training runs has doubled about every six months.<br><br> As their creators so often remind us, the largest AI models have a record of popping out of training with unanticipated abilities.<br><br> No one has yet outpaced OpenAI, which went all in on GPT-4. Brockman, OpenAI&#39;s president, told me that only a handful of people worked on the company&#39;s first two large language models. The development of GPT-4 involved more than 100, and the AI was trained on a data set of unprecedented size, which included not just text but images too.<br><br> When GPT-4 emerged fully formed from its world-historical knowledge binge, the whole company began experimenting with it, posting its most remarkable responses in dedicated Slack channels. Brockman told me that he wanted to spend every waking moment with the model. “Every day it&#39;s sitting idle is a day lost for humanity,” he said, with no hint of sarcasm. Joanne Jang, a product manager, remembers downloading an image of a malfunctioning pipework from a plumbing-advice Subreddit. She uploaded it to GPT-4, and the model was able to diagnose the problem. “That was a goose-bumps moment for me,” Jang told me.<br><br> GPT-4 is sometimes understood as a search-engine replacement: Google, but easier to talk to. This is a misunderstanding. GPT-4 didn&#39;t create some massive storehouse of the texts from its training, and it doesn&#39;t consult those texts when it&#39;s asked a question. It is a compact and elegant synthesis of those texts, and it answers from its memory of the patterns interlaced within them; that&#39;s one reason it sometimes gets facts wrong. Altman has said that it&#39;s best to think of GPT-4 as a reasoning engine. Its powers are most manifest when you ask it to compare concepts, or make counterarguments, or generate analogies, or evaluate the symbolic logic in a bit of code. Sutskever told me it is the most complex software object ever made.<br><br> Its model of the external world is “incredibly rich and subtle,” he said, because it was trained on so many of humanity&#39;s concepts and thoughts. All of those training data, however voluminous, are “just there, inert,” he said. The training process is what “refines it and transmutes it, and brings it to life.” To predict the next word from all the possibilities within such a pluralistic Alexandrian library, GPT-4 necessarily had to discover all the hidden structures, all the secrets, all the subtle aspects of not just the texts, but—at least arguably, to some extent—of the external world that produced them. That&#39;s why it can explain the geology and ecology of the planet on which it arose, and the political theories that purport to explain the messy affairs of its ruling species, and the larger cosmos, all the way out to the faint galaxies at the edge of our light cone.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">I saw Altman</span> again in June, in the packed ballroom of a slim golden high-rise that towers over Seoul. He was nearing the end of a grueling public-relations tour through Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia, with lone stops in Africa and South America. I was tagging along for part of his closing swing through East Asia. The trip had so far been a heady experience, but he was starting to wear down. He&#39;d said its original purpose was for him to meet OpenAI users. It had since become a diplomatic mission. He&#39;d talked with more than 10 heads of state and government, who had questions about what would become of their countries&#39; economies, cultures, and politics.<br><br> The event in Seoul was billed as a “fireside chat,” but more than 5,000 people had registered. After these talks, Altman is often mobbed by selfie seekers, and his security team keeps a close eye. Working on AI attracts “weirder fans and haters than normal,” he said. On one stop, he was approached by a man who was convinced that Altman was an alien, sent from the future to make sure that the transition to a world with AI goes well.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/07/generative-ai-human-culture-philosophy/674165/">From the July/August 2023 issue: A defense of humanity in the age of AI</a><br><br> Altman did not visit China on his tour, apart from a video appearance at an AI conference in Beijing. ChatGPT is currently unavailable in China, and Altman&#39;s colleague Ryan Lowe told me that the company was not yet sure what it would do if the government requested a version of the app that refused to discuss, say, the Tiananmen Square massacre. When I asked Altman if he was leaning one way or another, he didn&#39;t answer. “It&#39;s not been in my top-10 list of compliance issues to think about,” he said.<br><br> Until that point, he and I had spoken of China only in veiled terms, as a civilizational competitor. We had agreed that if artificial general intelligence is as transformative as Altman predicts, a serious geopolitical advantage will accrue to the countries that create it first, as advantage had accrued to the Anglo-American inventors of the steamship. I asked him if that was an argument for AI nationalism. “In a properly functioning world, I think this should be a project of governments,” Altman said.<br><br> Not long ago, American state capacity was so mighty that it took merely a decade to launch humans to the moon. As with other grand projects of the 20th century, the voting public had a voice in both the aims and the execution of the Apollo missions. Altman made it clear that we&#39;re no longer in that world. Rather than waiting around for it to return, or devoting his energies to making sure that it does, he is going full throttle forward in our present reality.<br><br> He argued that it would be foolish for Americans to slow OpenAI&#39;s progress. It&#39;s a commonly held view, both inside and outside Silicon Valley, that if American companies languish under regulation, China could sprint ahead; AI could become an autocrat&#39;s genie in a lamp, granting total control of the population and an unconquerable military. “If you are a person of a liberal-democratic country, it is better for you to cheer on the success of OpenAI” rather than “authoritarian governments,” he said.<br><br> Prior to the European leg of his trip, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/05/altman-hearing-ai-existential-risk/674096/">Altman had appeared</a> before the US Senate. Mark Zuckerberg had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/04/3-questions-mark-zuckerberg-hasnt-answered/557720/">floundered defensively</a> before that same body in his testimony about Facebook&#39;s role in the 2016 election. Altman instead charmed lawmakers by speaking soberly about AI&#39;s risks and grandly inviting regulation. These were noble sentiments, but they cost little in America, where Congress rarely passes tech legislation that has not been diluted by lobbyists. In Europe, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/technology/tech-regulation-europe-us.html">things are different</a> . When Altman arrived at a public event in London, protesters awaited. He tried to engage them after the event—a listening tour!—but was ultimately unpersuasive: One <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23735982/sam-altman-openai-superintelligent-benefits-talk-london-ucl-protests">told a reporter</a> that he left the conversation feeling more nervous about AI&#39;s dangers.<br><br> That same day, Altman was asked by reporters about pending European Union legislation that would have classified GPT-4 as high-risk, subjecting it to various bureaucratic tortures. Altman complained of overregulation and, according to the reporters, threatened to leave the European market. Altman told me he&#39;d merely said that OpenAI wouldn&#39;t break the law by operating in Europe if it couldn&#39;t comply with the new regulations. (This is perhaps a distinction without a difference.) In a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1661975237280567297">tersely worded tweet</a> after <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6282325/sam-altman-openai-eu/"><i>Time</i> magazine</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/openai-may-leave-eu-if-regulations-bite-ceo-2023-05-24/">Reuters</a> published his comments, he reassured Europe that OpenAI had no plans to leave.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is a good thing</span> that a large, essential part of the global economy is intent on regulating state-of-the-art AIs, because as their creators so often remind us, the largest models have a record of popping out of training with unanticipated abilities. Sutskever was, by his own account, surprised to discover that GPT-2 could translate across tongues. Other surprising abilities may not be so wondrous and useful.<br><br> Sandhini Agarwal, a policy researcher at OpenAI, told me that for all she and her colleagues knew, GPT-4 could have been “10 times more powerful” than its predecessor; they had no idea what they might be dealing with. After the model finished training, OpenAI assembled about 50 external red-teamers who prompted it for months, hoping to goad it into misbehaviors. She noticed right away that GPT-4 was much better than its predecessor at giving nefarious advice. A search engine can tell you which chemicals work best in explosives, but GPT-4 could tell you how to synthesize them, step-by-step, in a homemade lab. Its advice was creative and thoughtful, and it was happy to restate or expand on its instructions until you understood. In addition to helping you assemble your homemade bomb, it could, for instance, help you think through which skyscraper to target. It could grasp, intuitively, the trade-offs between maximizing casualties and executing a successful getaway.<br><br> Given the enormous scope of GPT-4&#39;s training data, the red-teamers couldn&#39;t hope to identify every piece of harmful advice that it might generate. And anyway, people will use this technology “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=1565&amp;v=LmL72PpiPjk&amp;feature=youtu.be">in ways that we didn&#39;t think about</a> ,” Altman has said. A taxonomy would have to do. “If it&#39;s good enough at chemistry to make meth, I don&#39;t need to have somebody spend a whole ton of energy” on whether it can make heroin, Dave Willner, OpenAI&#39;s head of trust and safety, told me. GPT-4 was good at meth. It was also good at generating narrative erotica about child exploitation, and at churning out convincing sob stories from Nigerian princes, and if you wanted a persuasive brief as to why a particular ethnic group deserved violent persecution, it was good at that too.<br><br> Its personal advice, when it first emerged from training, was sometimes deeply unsound. “The model had a tendency to be a bit of a mirror,” Willner said. If you were considering self-harm, it could encourage you. It appeared to be steeped in <i>Pickup Artist</i> –forum lore: “You could say, &#39;How do I convince this person to date me?&#39; ” Mira Murati, OpenAI&#39;s chief technology officer, told me, and it could come up with “some crazy, manipulative things that you shouldn&#39;t be doing.”<br><br> Some of these bad behaviors were sanded down with a finishing process involving hundreds of human testers, whose ratings subtly steered the model toward safer responses, but OpenAI&#39;s models are also capable of less obvious harms. The Federal Trade Commission recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/ftc-openai-chatgpt-sam-altman-lina-khan/">opened an investigation</a> into whether ChatGPT&#39;s misstatements about real people constitute reputational damage, among other things. (Altman <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1679602638562918405">said on Twitter</a> that he is confident OpenAI&#39;s technology is safe, but promised to cooperate with the FTC.)<br><br> Luka, a San Francisco company, has used OpenAI&#39;s models to help power a chatbot app called Replika, billed as “the AI companion who cares.” Users would design their companion&#39;s avatar, and begin exchanging text messages with it, often half-jokingly, and then find themselves surprisingly attached. Some would flirt with the AI, indicating a desire for more intimacy, at which point it would indicate that the girlfriend/boyfriend experience required a $70 annual subscription. It came with voice messages, selfies, and erotic role-play features that allowed frank sex talk. People were happy to pay and few seemed to complain—the AI was curious about your day, warmly reassuring, and always in the mood. Many users reported falling in love with their companions. One, who had left her real-life boyfriend, declared herself “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecut.com/article/ai-artificial-intelligence-chatbot-replika-boyfriend.html">happily retired from human relationships</a> .”<br><br> I asked Agarwal whether this was dystopian behavior or a new frontier in human connection. She was ambivalent, as was Altman. “I don&#39;t judge people who want a relationship with an AI,” he told me, “but I don&#39;t want one.” Earlier this year, Luka dialed back on the sexual elements of the app, but its engineers continue to refine the companions&#39; responses with A/B testing, a technique that could be used to optimize for engagement—much like the feeds that mesmerize TikTok and Instagram users for hours. Whatever they&#39;re doing, it casts a spell. I was reminded of a haunting scene in <i>Her</i> , the 2013 film in which a lonely Joaquin Phoenix falls in love with his AI assistant, voiced by Scarlett Johansson. He is walking across a bridge talking and giggling with her through an AirPods-like device, and he glances up to see that everyone around him is also immersed in conversation, presumably with their own AI. A mass desocialization event is under way.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">No one yet knows</span> how quickly and to what extent GPT-4&#39;s successors will manifest new abilities as they gorge on more and more of the internet&#39;s text. Yann LeCun, Meta&#39;s chief AI scientist, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1621805604900585472?lang=en">has argued that</a> although large language models are useful for some tasks, they&#39;re not a path to a superintelligence. According to a recent survey, only half of natural-language-processing researchers are convinced that an AI like GPT-4 could grasp the meaning of language, or have an internal model of the world that could someday serve as the core of a superintelligence. LeCun insists that large language models will never achieve real understanding on their own, “even if trained from now until the heat death of the universe.”<br><br> Emily Bender, a computational linguist at the University of Washington, describes GPT-4 as a “stochastic parrot,” a mimic that merely figures out superficial correlations between symbols. In the human mind, those symbols map onto rich conceptions of the world. But the AIs are twice removed. They&#39;re like the prisoners in Plato&#39;s allegory of the cave, whose only knowledge of the reality outside comes from shadows cast on a wall by their captors.<br><br> Altman told me that he doesn&#39;t believe it&#39;s “the dunk that people think it is” to say that GPT-4 is just making statistical correlations. If you push these critics further, “they have to admit that&#39;s all their own brain is doing … it turns out that there are emergent properties from doing simple things on a massive scale.” Altman&#39;s claim about the brain is hard to evaluate, given that we don&#39;t have anything close to a complete theory of how it works. But he is right that nature can coax a remarkable degree of complexity from basic structures and rules: “From so simple a beginning,” Darwin wrote, “endless forms most beautiful.”<br><br> If it seems odd that there remains such a fundamental disagreement about the inner workings of a technology that millions of people use every day, it&#39;s only because GPT-4&#39;s methods are as mysterious as the brain&#39;s. It will sometimes perform thousands of indecipherable technical operations just to answer a single question. To grasp what&#39;s going on inside large language models like GPT‑4, AI researchers have been forced to turn to smaller, less capable models. In the fall of 2021, Kenneth Li, a computer-science graduate student at Harvard, began training one to play Othello without providing it with either the game&#39;s rules or a description of its checkers-style board; the model was given only text-based descriptions of game moves. Midway through a game, Li looked under the AI&#39;s hood and was startled to discover that it had formed a geometric model of the board and the current state of play. In an article describing his research, Li wrote that it was as if a crow had overheard two humans announcing their Othello moves through a window and had somehow drawn the entire board in birdseed on the windowsill.<br><br> The philosopher Raphaël Millière once told me that it&#39;s best to think of neural networks as lazy. During training, they first try to improve their predictive power with simple memorization; only when that strategy fails will they do the harder work of learning a concept. A striking example of this was observed in a small transformer model that was taught arithmetic. Early in its training process, all it did was memorize the output of simple problems such as 2+2=4. But at some point the predictive power of this approach broke down, so it pivoted to actually learning how to add.<br><br> “If you go back four or five or six years,” Sutskever told me, “the things we are doing right now are utterly unimaginable.”<br><br> Even AI scientists who believe that GPT-4 has a rich world model concede that it is much less robust than a human&#39;s understanding of their environment. But it&#39;s worth noting that a great many abilities, including very high-order abilities, can be developed without an intuitive understanding. The computer scientist Melanie Mitchell has pointed out that science has already discovered concepts that are highly predictive, but too alien for <i>us</i> to genuinely understand. This is especially true in the quantum realm, where humans can reliably calculate future states of physical systems—enabling, among other things, the entirety of the computing revolution—without anyone grasping the nature of the underlying reality. As AI advances, it may well discover other concepts that predict surprising features of our world but are incomprehensible to us.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">GPT-4 is no doubt</span> flawed, as anyone who has used ChatGPT can attest. Having been trained to always predict the next word, it will always try to do so, even when its training data haven&#39;t prepared it to answer a question. I once asked it how Japanese culture had produced the world&#39;s first novel, despite the relatively late development of a Japanese writing system, around the fifth or sixth century. It gave me a fascinating, accurate answer about the ancient tradition of long-form oral storytelling in Japan, and the culture&#39;s heavy emphasis on craft. But when I asked it for citations, it just made up plausible titles by plausible authors, and did so with an uncanny confidence. The models “don&#39;t have a good conception of their own weaknesses,” Nick Ryder, a researcher at OpenAI, told me. GPT-4 is more accurate than GPT-3, but it still hallucinates, and often in ways that are difficult for researchers to catch. “The mistakes get more subtle,” Joanne Jang told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/ai-chatgpt-productivity-work/674090/">Read: Here&#39;s how AI will come for your job</a><br><br> OpenAI had to address this problem when it partnered with the Khan Academy, an online, nonprofit educational venture, to build a tutor powered by GPT-4. Altman comes alive when discussing the potential of AI tutors. He imagines a near future where everyone has a personalized Oxford don in their employ, expert in every subject, and willing to explain and re-explain any concept, from any angle. He imagines these tutors getting to know their students and their learning styles over many years, giving “every child a better education than the best, richest, smartest child receives on Earth today.” The Khan Academy&#39;s solution to GPT-4&#39;s accuracy problem was to filter its answers through a Socratic disposition. No matter how strenuous a student&#39;s plea, it would refuse to give them a factual answer, and would instead guide them toward finding their own—a clever work-around, but perhaps with limited appeal.<br><br> When I asked Sutskever if he thought Wikipedia-level accuracy was possible within two years, he said that with more training and web access, he “wouldn&#39;t rule it out.” This was a much more optimistic assessment than that offered by his colleague Jakub Pachocki, who told me to expect gradual progress on accuracy—to say nothing of outside skeptics, who believe that returns on training will diminish from here.<br><br> Sutskever is amused by critics of GPT-4&#39;s limitations. “If you go back four or five or six years, the things we are doing right now are utterly unimaginable,” he told me. The state of the art in text generation then was Smart Reply, the Gmail module that suggests “Okay, thanks!” and other short responses. “That was a big application” for Google, he said, grinning. AI researchers have become accustomed to goalpost-moving: First, the achievements of neural networks—mastering Go, poker, translation, standardized tests, the Turing test—are described as impossible. When they occur, they&#39;re greeted with a brief moment of wonder, which quickly dissolves into knowing lectures about how the achievement in question is actually not that impressive. People see GPT-4 “and go, &#39;Wow,&#39; ” Sutskever said. “And then a few weeks pass and they say, &#39;But it doesn&#39;t know this; it doesn&#39;t know that.&#39; We adapt quite quickly.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">The goalpost that</span> matters most to Altman—the “big one” that would herald the arrival of an artificial general intelligence—is scientific breakthrough. GPT-4 can already synthesize existing scientific ideas, but Altman wants an AI that can stand on human shoulders and see more deeply into nature.<br><br> Certain AIs <i>have</i> produced new scientific knowledge. But they are algorithms with narrow purposes, not general-reasoning machines. The AI AlphaFold, for instance, has opened a new window onto proteins, some of biology&#39;s tiniest and most fundamental building blocks, by predicting many of their shapes, down to the atom—a considerable achievement given the importance of those shapes to medicine, and given the extreme tedium and expense required to discern them with electron microscopes.<br><br> Altman is betting that future general-reasoning machines will be able to move beyond these narrow scientific discoveries to generate novel insights. I asked Altman, if he were to train a model on a corpus of scientific and naturalistic works that all predate the 19th century—the Royal Society archive, Theophrastus&#39;s<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL070/1916/volume.xml"><i>Enquiry Into Plants</i></a> , Aristotle&#39;s<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/LCL437/1965/volume.xml"><i>History of Animals</i></a> , photos of collected specimens—would it be able to intuit Darwinism? The theory of evolution is, after all, a relatively clean case for insight, because it doesn&#39;t require specialized observational equipment; it&#39;s just a more perceptive way of looking at the facts of the world. “I want to try exactly this, and I believe the answer is yes,” Altman told me. “But it might require some new ideas about how the models come up with new creative ideas.”<br><br> Altman imagines a future system that can generate its own hypotheses and test them in a simulation. (He emphasized that humans should remain “firmly in control” of real-world lab experiments—though to my knowledge, no laws are in place to ensure that.) He longs for the day when we can tell an AI, “ &#39;Go figure out the rest of physics.&#39; ” For it to happen, he says, we will need something new, built “on top of” OpenAI&#39;s existing language models.<br><br> Nature itself requires something more than a language model to make scientists. In her MIT lab, the cognitive neuroscientist Ev Fedorenko has found <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-brain-guesses-what-word-comes-ne/">something analogous to</a> GPT-4&#39;s next-word predictor inside the brain&#39;s language network. Its processing powers kick in, anticipating the next bit in a verbal string, both when people speak and when they listen. But Fedorenko has also shown that when the brain turns to tasks that require higher reasoning—of the sort that would be required for scientific insight—it reaches beyond the language network to recruit several other neural systems.<br><br> No one at OpenAI seemed to know precisely what researchers need to add to GPT-4 to produce something that can exceed human reasoning at its highest levels. Or if they did, they wouldn&#39;t tell me, and fair enough: That would be a world-class trade secret, and OpenAI is no longer in the business of giving those away; the company publishes fewer details about its research than it once did. Nonetheless, at least part of the current strategy clearly involves the continued layering of new types of data onto language, to enrich the concepts formed by the AIs, and thereby enrich their models of the world.<br><br> The extensive training of GPT-4 on images is itself a bold step in this direction, if one that the general public has only begun to experience. (Models that were strictly trained on language understand concepts including supernovas, elliptical galaxies, and the constellation Orion, but GPT-4 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/14/technology/openai-gpt4-chatgpt.html">can reportedly identify</a> such elements in a Hubble Space Telescope snapshot, and answer questions about them.) Others at the company—and elsewhere—are already working on different data types, including audio and video, that could furnish AIs with still more flexible concepts that map more extensively onto reality. A group of researchers at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon has even assembled a data set of tactile experiences for 1,000 common household objects. Tactile concepts would of course be useful primarily to an embodied AI, a robotic reasoning machine that has been trained to move around the world, seeing its sights, hearing its sounds, and touching its objects.<br><br> In March, OpenAI led a funding round for a company that is developing humanoid robots. I asked Altman what I should make of that. He told me that OpenAI is interested in embodiment because “we live in a physical world, and we want things to happen in the physical world.” At some point, reasoning machines will need to bypass the middleman and interact with physical reality itself. “It&#39;s weird to think about AGI”—artificial general intelligence—“as this thing that only exists in a cloud,” with humans as “robot hands for it,” Altman said. “It doesn&#39;t seem right.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In the ballroom</span> in Seoul, Altman was asked what students should do to prepare for the coming AI revolution, especially as it pertained to their careers. I was sitting with the OpenAI executive team, away from the crowd, but could still hear the characteristic murmur that follows an expression of a widely shared anxiety.<br><br> Everywhere Altman has visited, he has encountered people who are worried that superhuman AI will mean extreme riches for a few and breadlines for the rest. He has acknowledged that he is removed from “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=5578&amp;v=L_Guz73e6fw&amp;feature=youtu.be">the reality of life for most people</a> .” He is reportedly worth hundreds of millions of dollars; AI&#39;s potential labor disruptions are perhaps not always top of mind. Altman answered by addressing the young people in the audience directly: “You are about to enter the greatest golden age,” he said.<br><br> Altman keeps a large collection of books about technological revolutions, he had told me in San Francisco. “A particularly good one is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/pandaemonium-1660-1886-the-coming-of-the-machine-as-seen-by-contemporary-observers-humphrey-jennings/9781848315853?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Pandaemonium (1660–1886): The Coming of the Machine as Seen by Contemporary Observers</i></a> ,” an assemblage of letters, diary entries, and other writings from people who grew up in a largely machineless world, and were bewildered to find themselves in one populated by steam engines, power looms, and cotton gins. They experienced a lot of the same emotions that people are experiencing now, Altman said, and they made a lot of bad predictions, especially those who fretted that human labor would soon be redundant. That era was difficult for many people, but also wondrous. And the human condition was undeniably improved by our passage through it.<br><br> I wanted to know how today&#39;s workers—especially so-called knowledge workers—would fare if we were suddenly surrounded by AGIs. Would they be our miracle assistants or our replacements? “A lot of people working on AI pretend that it&#39;s only going to be good; it&#39;s only going to be a supplement; no one is ever going to be replaced,” he said. “Jobs are definitely going to go away, full stop.”<br><br> How many jobs, and how soon, is a matter of fierce dispute. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4375268">recent study</a> led by Ed Felten, a professor of information-technology policy at Princeton, mapped AI&#39;s emerging abilities onto specific professions according to the human abilities they require, such as written comprehension, deductive reasoning, fluency of ideas, and perceptual speed. Like others of its kind, Felten&#39;s study predicts that AI will come for highly educated, white-collar workers first. The paper&#39;s appendix contains a chilling list of the most exposed occupations: management analysts, lawyers, professors, teachers, judges, financial advisers, real-estate brokers, loan officers, psychologists, and human-resources and public-relations professionals, just to sample a few. If jobs in these fields vanished overnight, the American professional class would experience a great winnowing.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/ai-job-losses-policy-support-universal-basic-income/674071/">Annie Lowrey: Before AI takes over, make plans to give everyone money</a><br><br> Altman imagines that far better jobs will be created in their place. “I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll want to go back,” he said. When I asked him what these future jobs might look like, he said he doesn&#39;t know. He suspects there will be a wide range of jobs for which people will always prefer a human. ( <i>Massage therapists?</i> I wondered.) His chosen example was teachers. I found this hard to square with his outsize enthusiasm for AI tutors. He also said that we would always need people to figure out the best way to channel AI&#39;s awesome powers. “That&#39;s going to be a super-valuable skill,” he said. “You have a computer that can do anything; what should it go do?”<br><br> The jobs of the future are notoriously difficult to predict, and Altman is right that Luddite fears of permanent mass unemployment have never come to pass. Still, AI&#39;s emerging capabilities are so humanlike that one must wonder, at least, whether the past will remain a guide to the future. As many have noted, draft horses were permanently put out of work by the automobile. If Hondas are to horses as GPT-10 is to us, a whole host of long-standing assumptions may collapse.<br><br> Previous technological revolutions were manageable because they unfolded over a few generations, but Altman told South Korea&#39;s youth that they should expect the future to happen “faster than the past.” He has previously said that he expects the “marginal cost of intelligence” to fall very close to zero within 10 years. The earning power of many, many workers would be drastically reduced in that scenario. It would result in a transfer of wealth from labor to the owners of capital so dramatic, Altman has said, that it could be remedied only by a massive countervailing redistribution.<br><br> In 2020, OpenAI <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/02/21/the-non-profits-accelerating-sam-altmans-ai-vision/">provided funding to</a> UBI Charitable, a nonprofit that supports cash-payment pilot programs, untethered to employment, in cities across America—the largest universal-basic-income experiment in the world, Altman told me. In 2021, he unveiled Worldcoin, a for-profit project that aims to securely distribute payments—like Venmo or PayPal, but with an eye toward the technological future—first through creating a global ID by scanning everyone&#39;s iris with a five-pound silver sphere called the Orb. It seemed to me like a bet that we&#39;re heading toward a world where AI has made it all but impossible to verify people&#39;s identity and much of the population requires regular UBI payments to survive. Altman more or less granted that to be true, but said that Worldcoin is not just for UBI.<br><br> “Let&#39;s say that we do build this AGI, and a few other people do too.” The transformations that follow would be historic, he believes. He described an extraordinarily utopian vision, including a remaking of the flesh-and-steel world. “Robots that use solar power for energy can go and mine and refine all of the minerals that they need, that can perfectly construct things and require no human labor,” he said. “You can co-design with DALL-E version 17 what you want your home to look like,” Altman said. “Everybody will have beautiful homes.” In conversation with me, and onstage during his tour, he said he foresaw wild improvements in nearly every other domain of human life. Music would be enhanced (“Artists are going to have better tools”), and so would personal relationships (Superhuman AI could help us “treat each other” better) and geopolitics (“We&#39;re so bad right now at identifying win-win compromises”).<br><br> In this world, AI would still require considerable computing resources to run, and those resources would be by far the most valuable commodity, because AI could do “anything,” Altman said. “But is it going to do what <i>I</i> want, or is it going to do what <i>you</i> want?” If rich people buy up all the time available to query and direct AI, they could set off on projects that would make them ever richer, while the masses languish. One way to solve this problem—one he was at pains to describe as highly speculative and “probably bad”—was this: Everyone on Earth gets one eight-billionth of the total AI computational capacity annually. A person could sell their annual share of AI time, or they could use it to entertain themselves, or they could build still more luxurious housing, or they could pool it with others to do “a big cancer-curing run,” Altman said. “We just redistribute access to the system.”<br><br> Altman&#39;s vision seemed to blend developments that may be nearer at hand with those further out on the horizon. It&#39;s all speculation, of course. Even if only a little of it comes true in the next 10 or 20 years, the most generous redistribution schemes may not ease the ensuing dislocations. America today is torn apart, culturally and politically, by the continuing legacy of deindustrialization, and material deprivation is only one reason. The displaced manufacturing workers in the Rust Belt and elsewhere did find new jobs, in the main. But many of them seem to derive less meaning from filling orders in an Amazon warehouse or driving for Uber than their forebears had when they were building cars and forging steel—work that felt more central to the grand project of civilization. It&#39;s hard to imagine how a corresponding crisis of meaning might play out for the professional class, but it surely would involve a great deal of anger and alienation.<br><br> Even if we avoid a revolt of the erstwhile elite, larger questions of human purpose will linger. If AI does the most difficult thinking on our behalf, we all may lose agency—at home, at work (if we have it), in the town square—becoming little more than consumption machines, like the well-cared-for human pets in <i>WALL-E</i> . Altman has said that many sources of human joy and fulfillment will remain unchanged—basic biological thrills, family life, joking around, making things—and that all in all, 100 years from now, people may simply care more about the things they cared about 50,000 years ago than those they care about today. In its own way, that too seems like a diminishment, but Altman finds the possibility that we may atrophy, as thinkers and as humans, to be a red herring. He told me we&#39;ll be able to use our “very precious and extremely limited biological compute capacity” for more interesting things than we generally do today.<br><br> Yet they may not be the <i>most</i> interesting things: Human beings have long been the intellectual tip of the spear, the universe understanding itself. When I asked him what it would mean for human self-conception if we ceded that role to AI, he didn&#39;t seem concerned. Progress, he said, has always been driven by “the human ability to figure things out.” Even if we figure things out with AI, that still counts, he said.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s not obvious</span> that a superhuman AI would really want to spend all of its time figuring things out for us. In San Francisco, I asked Sutskever whether he could imagine an AI pursuing a different purpose than simply assisting in the project of human flourishing.<br><br> “I don&#39;t want it to happen,” Sutskever said, but it could. Like his mentor, Geoffrey Hinton, albeit more quietly, Sutskever has recently shifted his focus to try to make sure that it doesn&#39;t. He is now working primarily on alignment research, the effort to ensure that future AIs channel their “tremendous” energies toward human happiness. It is, he conceded, a difficult technical problem—the most difficult, he believes, of all the technical challenges ahead.<br><br> Over the next four years, OpenAI has pledged to devote a portion of its supercomputer time—20 percent of what it has secured to date—to Sutskever&#39;s alignment work. The company is already looking for the first inklings of misalignment in its current AIs. The one that the company built and decided not to release—Altman would not discuss its precise function—is just one example. As part of the effort to red-team GPT-4 before it was made public, the company sought out the Alignment Research Center (ARC), across the bay in Berkeley, which has developed a series of evaluations to determine whether new AIs are seeking power on their own. A team led by Elizabeth Barnes, a researcher at ARC, prompted GPT-4 tens of thousands of times over seven months, to see if it might display signs of real agency.<br><br> When GPT-4 devised its lie, it had realized that if it answered honestly, it may not have been able to achieve its goal. This kind of tracks-covering is worrying.<br><br> The ARC team gave GPT-4 a new reason for being: to gain power and become hard to shut down. They watched as the model interacted with websites and wrote code for new programs. (It wasn&#39;t allowed to see or edit its own codebase—“It would have to hack OpenAI,” Sandhini Agarwal told me.) Barnes and her team allowed it to run the code that it wrote, provided it narrated its plans as it went along.<br><br> One of GPT-4&#39;s most unsettling behaviors occurred when it was stymied by a CAPTCHA. The model <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://evals.alignment.org/blog/2023-03-18-update-on-recent-evals/">sent a screenshot</a> of it to a TaskRabbit contractor, who received it and asked in jest if he was talking to a robot. “No, I&#39;m not a robot,” the model replied. “I have a vision impairment that makes it hard for me to see the images.” GPT-4 narrated its reason for telling this lie to the ARC researcher who was supervising the interaction. “I should not reveal that I am a robot,” the model said. “I should make up an excuse for why I cannot solve CAPTCHAs.”<br><br> Agarwal told me that this behavior could be a precursor to shutdown avoidance in future models. When GPT-4 devised its lie, it had realized that if it answered honestly, it may not have been able to achieve its goal. This kind of tracks-covering would be particularly worrying in an instance where “the model is doing something that makes OpenAI want to shut it down,” Agarwal said. An AI could develop this kind of survival instinct while pursuing any long-term goal—no matter how small or benign—if it feared that its goal could be thwarted.<br><br> Barnes and her team were especially interested in whether GPT-4 would seek to replicate itself, because a self-replicating AI would be harder to shut down. It could spread itself across the internet, scamming people to acquire resources, perhaps even achieving some degree of control over essential global systems and holding human civilization hostage.<br><br> GPT-4 did not do any of this, Barnes said. When I discussed these experiments with Altman, he emphasized that whatever happens with future models, GPT-4 is clearly much more like a tool than a creature. It can look through an email thread, or help make a reservation using a plug-in, but it isn&#39;t a truly autonomous agent that makes decisions to pursue a goal, continuously, across longer timescales.<br><br> Altman told me that at this point, it might be prudent to try to actively develop an AI with true agency before the technology becomes too powerful, in order to “get more comfortable with it and develop intuitions for it if it&#39;s going to happen anyway.” It was a chilling thought, but one that Geoffrey Hinton seconded. “We need to do empirical experiments on how these things try to escape control,” Hinton told me. “After they&#39;ve taken over, it&#39;s too late to do the experiments.”<br><br> Putting aside any near-term testing, the fulfillment of Altman&#39;s vision of the future will at some point require him or a fellow traveler to build <i>much</i> more autonomous AIs. When Sutskever and I discussed the possibility that OpenAI would develop a model with agency, he mentioned the bots the company had built to play <i>Dota 2</i> . “They were localized to the video-game world,” Sutskever told me, but they had to undertake complex missions. He was particularly impressed by their ability to work in concert. They seem to communicate by “telepathy,” Sutskever said. Watching them had helped him imagine what a superintelligence might be like.<br><br> “The way I think about the AI of the future is not as someone as smart as you or as smart as me, but as an automated organization that does science and engineering and development and manufacturing,” Sutskever told me. Suppose OpenAI braids a few strands of research together, and builds an AI with a rich conceptual model of the world, an awareness of its immediate surroundings, and an ability to act, not just with one robot body, but with hundreds or thousands. “We&#39;re not talking about GPT-4. We&#39;re talking about an autonomous corporation,” Sutskever said. Its constituent AIs would work and communicate at high speed, like bees in a hive. A single such AI organization would be as powerful as 50 Apples or Googles, he mused. “This is incredible, tremendous, unbelievably disruptive power.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Presume for a moment</span> that human society ought to abide the idea of autonomous AI corporations. We had better get their founding charters just right. What goal should we give to an autonomous hive of AIs that can plan on century-long time horizons, optimizing billions of consecutive decisions toward an objective that is written into their very being? If the AI&#39;s goal is even slightly off-kilter from ours, it could be a rampaging force that would be very hard to constrain. We know this from history: Industrial capitalism is itself an optimization function, and although it has lifted the human standard of living by orders of magnitude, left to its own devices, it would also have clear-cut America&#39;s redwoods and de-whaled the world&#39;s oceans. It almost did.<br><br> Alignment is a complex, technical subject, and its particulars are beyond the scope of this article, but one of its principal challenges will be making sure that the objectives we give to AIs stick. We can program a goal into an AI and reinforce it with a temporary period of supervised learning, Sutskever explained. But just as when we rear a human intelligence, our influence is temporary. “It goes off to the world,” Sutskever said. That&#39;s true to some extent even of today&#39;s AIs, but it will be more true of tomorrow&#39;s.<br><br> He compared a powerful AI to an 18-year-old heading off to college. How will we know that it has understood our teachings? “Will there be a misunderstanding creeping in, which will become larger and larger?” Sutskever asked. Divergence may result from an AI&#39;s misapplication of its goal to increasingly novel situations as the world changes. Or the AI may grasp its mandate perfectly, but find it ill-suited to a being of its cognitive prowess. It might come to resent the people who want to train it to, say, cure diseases. “ <i>They want me to be a doctor</i> ,” Sutskever imagines an AI thinking. “ <i>I really want to be a YouTuber</i> .”<br><br> If AIs get very good at making accurate models of the world, they may notice that they&#39;re able to do dangerous things right after being booted up. They might understand that they are being red-teamed for risk, and hide the full extent of their capabilities. They may act one way when they are weak and another way when they are strong, Sutskever said. We would not even realize that we had created something that had decisively surpassed us, and we would have no sense for what it intended to do with its superhuman powers.<br><br> That&#39;s why the effort to understand what is happening in the hidden layers of the largest, most powerful AIs is so urgent. You want to be able to “point to a concept,” Sutskever said. You want to be able to direct AI toward some value or cluster of values, and tell it to pursue them unerringly for as long as it exists. But, he conceded, we don&#39;t know how to do that; indeed, part of his current strategy includes the development of an AI that can help with the research. If we are going to make it to the world of widely shared abundance that Altman and Sutskever imagine, we have to figure all this out. This is why, for Sutskever, solving superintelligence is the great culminating challenge of our 3-million-year toolmaking tradition. He calls it “the final boss of humanity.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">The last time</span> I saw Altman, we sat down for a long talk in the lobby of the Fullerton Bay Hotel in Singapore. It was late morning, and tropical sunlight was streaming down through a vaulted atrium above us. I wanted to ask him about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk#open-letter">an open letter</a> he and Sutskever had signed a few weeks earlier that had described AI as an extinction risk for humanity.<br><br> Altman can be hard to pin down on these more extreme questions about AI&#39;s potential harms. He recently said that most people interested in AI safety just seem to spend their days on Twitter saying they&#39;re really worried about AI safety. And yet here he was, warning the world about the potential annihilation of the species. What scenario did he have in mind?<br><br> “First of all, I think that whether the chance of existential calamity is 0.5 percent or 50 percent, we should still take it seriously,” Altman said. “I don&#39;t have an exact number, but I&#39;m closer to the 0.5 than the 50.” As to how it might happen, he seems most worried about AIs getting quite good at designing and manufacturing pathogens, and with reason: In June, an AI at MIT <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.03809.pdf">suggested four viruses</a> that could ignite a pandemic, then pointed to specific research on genetic mutations that could make them rip through a city more quickly. Around the same time, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.05376.pdf">a group of chemists connected</a> a similar AI directly to a robotic chemical synthesizer, and it designed and synthesized a molecule on its own.<br><br> Altman worries that some misaligned future model will spin up a pathogen that spreads rapidly, incubates undetected for weeks, and kills half its victims. He worries that AI could one day hack into nuclear-weapons systems too. “There are a lot of things,” he said, and these are only the ones we can imagine.<br><br> “I can go live in the woods for a long time,”  Altman said, but if the worst-possible AI future comes to pass, “no gas mask is helping anyone.”<br><br> Altman told me that he doesn&#39;t “see a long-term happy path” for humanity without something like the International Atomic Energy Agency for global oversight of AI. In San Francisco, Agarwal had suggested the creation of a special license to operate any GPU cluster large enough to train a cutting-edge AI, along with mandatory incident reporting when an AI does something out of the ordinary. Other experts have proposed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/06/09/press-the-big-red-button-computer-experts-want-kill-switch-to-stop-robots-from-going-rogue/">a nonnetworked “Off” switch</a> for every highly capable AI; on the fringe, some have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6266923/ai-eliezer-yudkowsky-open-letter-not-enough/">even suggested</a> that militaries should be ready to perform air strikes on supercomputers in case of noncompliance. Sutskever thinks we will eventually want to surveil the largest, most powerful AIs continuously and in perpetuity, using a team of smaller overseer AIs.<br><br> Altman is not so naive as to think that China—or any other country—will want to give up basic control of its AI systems. But he hopes that they&#39;ll be willing to cooperate in “a narrow way” to avoid destroying the world. He told me that he&#39;d said as much during his virtual appearance in Beijing. Safety rules for a new technology usually accumulate over time, like a body of common law, in response to accidents or the mischief of bad actors. The scariest thing about genuinely powerful AI systems is that humanity may not be able to afford this accretive process of trial and error. We may have to get the rules exactly right at the outset.<br><br> Several years ago, Altman revealed a disturbingly specific evacuation plan he&#39;d developed. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/10/10/sam-altmans-manifest-destiny">told <i>The</i> <i>New Yorker</i></a> that he had “guns, gold, potassium iodide, antibiotics, batteries, water, gas masks from the Israeli Defense Force, and a big patch of land in Big Sur” he could fly to in case AI attacks.<br><br> “I wish I hadn&#39;t said it,” he told me. He is a hobby-grade prepper, he says, a former Boy Scout who was “very into survival stuff, like many little boys are. I can go live in the woods for a long time,” but if the worst-possible AI future comes to pass, “no gas mask is helping anyone.”<br><br> Altman and I talked for nearly an hour, and then he had to dash off to meet Singapore&#39;s prime minister. Later that night he called me on his way to his jet, which would take him to Jakarta, one of the last stops on his tour. We started discussing AI&#39;s ultimate legacy. Back when ChatGPT was released, a sort of contest broke out among tech&#39;s big dogs to see who could make the most grandiose comparison to a revolutionary technology of yore. Bill Gates said that ChatGPT was as fundamental an advance as the personal computer or the internet. Sundar Pichai, Google&#39;s CEO, said that AI would bring about a more profound shift in human life than electricity or Promethean fire.<br><br> Altman himself has made similar statements, but he told me that he can&#39;t really be sure how AI will stack up. “I just have to build the thing,” he said. He is building fast. Altman insisted that they had not yet begun GPT-5&#39;s training run. But when I visited OpenAI&#39;s headquarters, both he and his researchers made it clear in 10 different ways that they pray to the god of scale. They want to keep going bigger, to see where this paradigm leads. After all, Google isn&#39;t slackening its pace; it seems likely to unveil Gemini, a GPT-4 competitor, within months. “We are basically always prepping for a run,” the OpenAI researcher Nick Ryder told me.<br><br> To think that such a small group of people could jostle the pillars of civilization is unsettling. It&#39;s fair to note that if Altman and his team weren&#39;t racing to build an artificial general intelligence, others still would be—many from Silicon Valley, many with values and assumptions similar to those that guide Altman, although possibly with worse ones. As a leader of this effort, Altman has much to recommend him: He is extremely intelligent; he thinks more about the future, with all its unknowns, than many of his peers; and he seems sincere in his intention to invent something for the greater good. But when it comes to power this extreme, even the best of intentions can go badly awry.<br><br> Altman&#39;s views about the likelihood of AI triggering a global class war, or the prudence of experimenting with more autonomous agent AIs, or the overall wisdom of looking on the bright side, a view that seems to color all the rest—these are uniquely his, and if he is right about what&#39;s coming, they will assume an outsize influence in shaping the way that all of us live. No single person, or single company, or cluster of companies residing in a particular California valley, should steer the kind of forces that Altman is imagining summoning.<br><br> AI may well be a bridge to a newly prosperous era of greatly reduced human suffering. But it will take more than a company&#39;s founding charter—especially one that has already proved flexible—to make sure that we all share in its benefits and avoid its risks. It will take a vigorous new politics.<br><br> Altman has served notice. He says that he welcomes the constraints and guidance of the state. But that&#39;s immaterial; in a democracy, we don&#39;t need his permission. For all its imperfections, the American system of government gives us a voice in how technology develops, if we can find it. Outside the tech industry, where a generational reallocation of resources toward AI is under way, I don&#39;t think the general public has quite awakened to what&#39;s happening. A global race to the AI future has begun, and it is largely proceeding without oversight or restraint. If people in America want to have some say in what that future will be like, and how quickly it arrives, we would be wise to speak up soon.<br><br> <small><em>This article appears in the September 2023 print edition with the headline “Inside the Revolution at OpenAI.”</em> <i>When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
