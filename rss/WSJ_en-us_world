The decline is roughly double in Southern states, such as Texas, said Bridget Hoffmann, an economist at the Inter-American Development Bank and one of the paper&#39;s co-authors.</p><p> Hoffmann and co-authors also found that higher summer temperatures negatively affect output growth in a range of industries, including agriculture, construction, finance and insurance, while boosting it in the utilities and mining industries.</p><p> The negative impact shows that “moving towards a service economy and moving some of your economy out of agriculture isn&#39;t enough to insulate your economy,” Hoffmann said.</p><p> The Houston Health Department has given out air conditioners and set up manned cooling centers so people without air conditioning can take refuge from the heat.

Kazuo Ueda said he was giving the market more freedom to push yields higher.</p><p> But Ueda said the move didn&#39;t mean the bank was giving up on the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-worlds-most-radical-experiment-in-monetary-policy-isnt-working-1488135495?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">monetary easing pursued over a decade</a> by his predecessor, Haruhiko Kuroda.

Masahiro Ichikawa, a strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui DS Asset Management, said that so long as rates don&#39;t jump too much, investors should feel at ease about corporate profits.</p><p> “The BOJ is likely to prevent any rapid increases in yields to show that it is not moving toward an exit,” Ichikawa said.</p><p> Weighing the BOJ&#39;s cap on government-bond yields—an unorthodox tool among global central banks—some analysts drew a comparison to the Bank of Japan&#39;s stock-buying program, which has stopped actively making purchases but hasn&#39;t been officially eliminated. Likewise, they said, the yield cap could be gradually abolished de facto even if it technically remains in place.</p><p> — <em>Kosaku Narioka contributed to this article.</em></p><p> Write to Megumi Fujikawa at <a href="mailto:megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">megumi.fujikawa@wsj.com</a></p></section></div></main></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 28 Jul 2023 11:49:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-japan-bucking-speculation-keeps-main-policy-unchanged-8d79ab6b</guid><link/> https://www.wsj.com/articles/bank-of-japan-bucking-speculation-keeps-main-policy-unchanged-8d79ab6b<author><![CDATA[Megumi Fujikawa]]></author><category> wsjworld</category><category>银行业</category><category>中央银行业务</category><category>银行/信贷</category><category>金融服务</category><category>货币政策</category><category>央行干预</category><category>利率</category><category>经济新闻</category><category>政治/一般新闻</category><category>政治/国际关系</category><category>国内政治</category><category>地区政治</category><category>债务/债券市场</category><category>商品/金融市场新闻</category><category>政府债务/债券市场</category><category>国家政府债务/债券市场</category><category>内容类型</category><category>法激活过滤器</category><category>C&amp;E 排除过滤器</category><category>SYND</category><category>华尔街日报-PRO-WSJ.com</category><category>日本银行</category><category>8301.TO</category><category>邮编：8301</category><category> Kazuo Ueda</category><category>货币政策</category><category>央行干预</category><category>利率</category><category>经济新闻</category><category>政治的</category><category>一般新闻</category><category>政治</category><category>国际关系</category><category>国内政治</category><category>地区政治</category><category>债务</category><category>债券市场</category><category>商品</category><category>金融市场新闻</category><category>政府债务</category><category>国家政府债务</category><category>内容类型</category><category>法蒂瓦过滤器</category><category>c&amp;e 排除过滤器</category><category>银行业</category><category>中央银行</category><category>信用</category><category>金融服务</category></item><item><title><![CDATA[An Exodus of Talent Is Imperiling Goldman’s Overhaul]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Wave of departures among senior executives could undermine David Solomon&#39;s asset-management strategy <figure><img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-825216/?width=1278&amp;size=1" alt="" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Alexandra Citrin-Safadi/The Wall Street Journal; Photo: iStock <span>Alexandra Citrin-Safadi/The Wall Street Journal; Photo: iStock</span> </figcaption></figure><!-- data-module-name="article.app/lib/module/wsj/breadcrumbs" --><main id="main" role="main"><div class="wsj-article-headline-wrap crawler"></div><div class="articleLead" itemprop="articleLead" data-sbid="WP-WSJ-0001090945"></div><div class="articleBody" data-sbid="WP-WSJ-0001090945"><div class="clearfix bylineWrap"><div class="byline"> By <span class="author" itemprop="name"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/annamaria-andriotis" itemprop="url" rel="author">AnnaMaria Andriotis</a></span></div><time class="timestamp article__timestamp flexbox__flex--1"> July 28, 2023 7:00 am ET </time></div><div subscriptions-actions="" subscriptions-display="NOT data.noSharing"><div class="share-bar"><amp-social-share type="system" width="72" height="24" data-param-url="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-exodus-of-talent-is-imperiling-goldmans-overhaul-f8225df9"></amp-social-share></div></div><section subscriptions-section="content"><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

They include Luke Sarsfield, who was named in that memo as co-head of asset management and lasted in that position less than a year, and Katie Koch, who was CIO of public equity and left to run money manager TCW Group.</p><p> There have been a series of changes to the asset-management division in recent years, which some executives have found unsettling. Others made the decision to depart after losing out on promotions or being demoted.</p><p> Solomon and Goldman President John Waldron are trying to pull off a major overhaul of the firm and its asset-management business, and big corporate restructurings like that are often turbulent.</p><p> This account is based on interviews with current and former Goldman officials. </p><div class="media-object scope-

In the wake of Goldman&#39;s retreat from consumer lending, he is hanging a big part of his and the firm&#39;s success on asset management.</p><p> The exits have raised concerns among members of Goldman&#39;s management committee about the asset-management team&#39;s ability to execute on its strategy.</p><p> “We have talented, tenured investment leaders, and we surround them with the resources of the firm,” said Marc Nachmann,</p> Goldman&#39;s global head of asset and wealth management. “Our attrition rate is the lowest in years for the investors who are doing the work of evaluating the actual investments at a granular level. Goldman Sachs professionals are in high demand, and while some will always find opportunities elsewhere, we feel good about the continuity of the team and the people we can attract.”<p></p><p> The asset- and wealth-management unit hit $2.71 trillion in assets under management in the second quarter, a record for the firm. Asset management includes public investments, which account for most of its assets, and private investments including in private equity, credit and real estate. (Wealth management helps ultrahigh net worth clients manage and invest their money and provides lending and banking services to them, too.)</p><p> Goldman said it is on track to meet all of its targets for asset and wealth management, including the generation of $10 billion in 2024 in fees from managing clients&#39; investments. Overall fee revenue rose 13% in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-sachs-gs-q2-earnings-report-2023-abea540?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">second quarter</a> year over year, ahead of its high single-digit target. </p><div class="media-object scope-

The firm is counting on it to become a bigger source of revenue that will generate steady fees and offset lulls in its traditional businesses of investment banking and trading—similar to how <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-morgan-stanley-got-its-mojo-back-1525359327?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">wealth management</a> powers chief rival Morgan Stanley&#39;s earnings.</p><p> But there is a view inside Goldman that Solomon and Waldron have made too many leadership and structure changes too quickly. They have replaced seasoned asset-management executives with investment bankers who don&#39;t know the business as well and have unrealistic expectations, according to that view.</p><p> Goldman late last year brought asset and wealth management back together, after Solomon and other senior leaders earlier decided to separate the two.</p><p> Asset-management clients, which include insurance companies, endowments, pension funds and very wealthy individuals, care mostly about who is managing their money and the returns they produce. Continuity among portfolio managers and leadership is a top priority.</p><p> Goldman executives in and outside of asset management are concerned that the departures will affect fundraising efforts, relationships with clients—some of whom have already flagged what they view as high turnover to Goldman officials—and, eventually, returns.</p><p> They have been reaching out to clients to assure them that they still have a deep bench of seasoned executives. </p><div class="media-object scope-

He moved to combine the private-investing businesses that were scattered throughout the firm in 2019.</p><p> After merging the private-investing businesses, Solomon moved the following year to combine them with the firm&#39;s public investment arm. Around that time, Goldman peeled wealth management away from asset management and combined it with its Marcus consumer operations, a move that was met with skepticism among some senior Goldman executives. Last year, it undid that change and moved a big chunk of consumer lending into its own division.</p><div class="media-object scope-web

Erdogan said repeatedly in recent weeks that he planned to speak with Putin to resurrect the deal, but so far the phone call hasn&#39;t taken place, diplomats say. Turkish officials have continued to press the issue through various other channels into the Kremlin, they said.</p><p> The clock is ticking to try to renew the deal. By September, Ukraine&#39;s grain harvest will begin to pile up in storage, making it harder to export in time and putting pressure on Erdogan and other leaders to get a resumption of the deal done in time.</p><p> The Black Sea Grain Initiative remains one of the few diplomatic breakthroughs of the war. Under the deal, Ukraine exported more than 32 million tons of grain, helping to bring down <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/where-heat-waves-lead-food-inflation-will-follow-ee6a32c?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">the price of food around the world</a> and ease concerns about a deepening of a global hunger crisis as a result of the invasion.</p><p> Russia&#39;s withdrawal from the grain deal will also put pressure on countries like Egypt, the world&#39;s largest wheat importer and a US security partner that has maintained friendly ties with Russia during the war despite pressure from Washington. Egypt is facing record 60% food inflation and a fast-depreciating currency, making imports extra costly. The country has scrambled to source from India and elsewhere since the war started, having imported most of its grains from Russia and Ukraine.</p><p> The United Nations, which helped broker and oversee the deal, and the US, China and others have called on Russia to return to the deal. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Around a quarter of the grain that flows through the Black Sea Initiative has gone to China.</p><p> “China is signaling publicly that it very much wants to see the Black Sea Initiative continue,” said Caitlin Welsh, an expert in food and water security at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a US think tank.</p><p> Last Thursday, Ukraine&#39;s deputy economy minister met with a senior Chinese official in Beijing, where the sides talked about expanding their grain exports. On Sunday, China told the UN&#39;s Security Council that given the initiative&#39;s importance in global food security it should be implemented, while state-run media has carried stories saying the initiative should continue.</p><p> Russia has said that it will replace any lost Ukrainian grain on global markets. But while it has the reserves of wheat to do that it won&#39;t be able to replace the huge amounts of Ukrainian corn that goes to China, Welsh said. Ukraine typically accounts for more than a quarter of all Chinese corn imports and a large slice of barley purchases, according to the Ukrainian Grain Association.</p><p> Russian attacks on Ukrainian Black Sea ports this week hit and partly destroyed 60,000 metric tons of grain that were set to be loaded onto a ship headed to China, according to Kernel, the Ukrainian grain traders who sold the cargo.</p><p> Around half of Ukrainian grain, or some 29 million metric tons, was exported through the Black Sea corridor during the last harvest season, of 2022 to 2023, according to the Ukrainian Grain Association. The rest was evenly split between Ukraine&#39;s Danube ports, where grain is loaded onto barges and sent to Romanian ports, and by land across its borders with the European Union.</p><p> It will be hard for Ukraine to replace grain exports that went directly to China through Black Sea ports because the countries they will now be exported through, mainly Poland and Romania, don&#39;t have the same approvals from China, whether on hygiene or otherwise, as Kyiv does, according to Sergey Ivashchenko, a director at the Ukrainian Grain Association.</p><p class="articleTagLine"> —Chao Deng and Oksana Pyrozhok contributed to this article.</p><p> Write to Jared Malsin at <a href="mailto:jared.malsin@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">jared.malsin@wsj.com</a> and Alistair MacDonald at <a href="mailto:Alistair.Macdonald@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">Alistair.Macdonald@wsj.com</a></p></section></div></main></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 28 Jul 2023 10:21:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.wsj.com/articles/great-power-rivalry-looms-over-ukraine-grain-deal-3d2e0eb1</guid><link/> https://www.wsj.com/articles/great-power-rivalry-looms-over-ukraine-grain-deal-3d2e0eb1<author><![CDATA[Jared MalsinAlistair MacDonald]]></author><category> gfx-contrib</category><category>乌克兰</category><category>wsjworld</category><category>政治/一般新闻</category><category>国际关系</category><category>政治/国际关系</category><category>乌克兰</category><category>SYND</category><category>华尔街日报-PRO-WSJ.com</category><category> Vladimir Putin</category><category> Tayyip Erdogan</category><category>政治的</category><category>一般新闻</category><category>国际关系</category><category>政治</category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Taiwan Amps Up Chinese-Invasion Drills to Deliver a Message: War Could Happen]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Military and civilian exercises are larger, louder, better coordinated as government seeks to battle public complacency <!-- data-module-name="article.app/lib/module/wsj/breadcrumbs" --><main id="main" role="main"><div class="wsj-article-headline-wrap crawler"></div><div class="articleLead" itemprop="articleLead" data-sbid="WP-WSJ-0001092728"><div class="is-lead-inset"><div class="media-object scope-

"></div><p> Brad Heppner had the grand idea of bringing investment opportunities enjoyed by Wall Street institutions to small-fry investors. It brought misery instead.</p><p> The Texas-based financial entrepreneur named his company <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/an-asset-management-merger-ended-in-bankruptcy-while-its-architect-got-174-million-11659103557?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Beneficient</a> , a branding mashup of beneficial and beneficent, the quality of doing good. To bankroll his new venture, Heppner and his business partners merged it with <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/retail-investors-face-1-3-billion-hit-after-asset-managers-detour-into-startups-11656066601?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">GWG Holdings</a> , an established financial-services firm that sold bonds to retail investors. GWG would raise the money. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/financial-firm-beneficient-pushed-boundaries-before-bond-programs-collapse-11671757459?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Beneficient</a> would put it to work. Heppner served as board chairman of both companies and recruited a cast of notable directors, including two former <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecGmw61nR6I" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noopener">Federal Reserve Bank presidents</a> and legendary Dallas Cowboys quarterback Roger Staubach.</p><p> From all appearances, Heppner and his team had a promising strategy: Beneficient would use money from GWG&#39;s investor base to acquire stakes in private-equity funds and other highflying assets, giving rank-and-file investors access to markets typically off limits to them. The first funds from GWG to Beneficient, $50 million, landed in June 2019. As far as board directors were concerned, Beneficient would use the money to expand the business, former directors said.</p><p> Instead, it kicked off what became one of the biggest financial blowups to strike retail investors in years.</p><p> Within weeks, Tiffany Kice, Beneficient&#39;s chief financial officer, discovered that millions of dollars went to payments for Heppner&#39;s nearly 1,500-acre east Texas ranch and his personal travel via private jet. Kice, formerly an audit partner at KPMG and CFO of Chuck E. Cheese, also found that the company had been using a faulty accounting method that would misstate revenue, according to private documents viewed by The Wall Street Journal.</p><p> What Kice learned about Beneficient&#39;s inner workings didn&#39;t, in her view, square with the best interests of investors, according to people who worked with her at the time. She repeatedly pressed Heppner for answers, and after one contentious exchange in July 2019, Kice shared a stack of financial documents with Sheldon “ Shelly” Stein, a senior board director, according to confidential court papers that allege what happened. Heppner&#39;s angry reaction had rattled her. She told Stein that she was afraid of him, the court papers show. Kice left the documents with Stein and resigned days later.</p><p> Over the next months, Kice&#39;s exit was followed by the departures of three board directors, including Stein, as well as a parade of C-suite executives—chief compliance officer, chief technology officer, operations chief and general counsel. The exits were largely driven by fears that the business risked catastrophic losses to investors while potentially benefiting Heppner, said former board directors and executives. </p><div class="media-object scope-

One high-profile director, former Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher, appeared in promotional videos, describing Beneficient&#39;s aim to become “an important contributor to the US economy.”</p><p> Last year, GWG defaulted on $2 billion in debt and filed for chapter 11, leaving retail investors with potential losses of as much as $1.3 billion. In separate bankruptcy and federal class-action lawsuits, investors accused board directors—including Fisher, former Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart, private-equity mogul Tom Hicks and insurance executive Bruce Schnitzer</p> —of facilitating a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by Heppner. Fisher, Lockhart, Hicks and Schnitzer denied any wrongdoing in court papers and declined to comment. Heppner denied wrongdoing in court papers and through a spokesman.<p></p><p> The Securities and Exchange Commission has been investigating GWG and Beneficient since 2020, regarding Beneficient&#39;s accounting methods and payments to Heppner-related entities, according to company disclosures and people familiar with the matter. The SEC in a June 29 letter to Beneficient warned of possible civil enforcement action that would allege securities violations. Heppner, the company&#39;s founder and chief executive, received a similar letter, a company filing shows. Beneficient and Heppner said their actions were appropriate, according to the filing.</p><p> “I have always worked to maintain best-in-class governance and transparency, consistent with my fiduciary duties as a director,” Heppner said in a statement to the Journal last year. “I always relied on the counsel of independent advisers and attorneys when in the boardroom.” </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

These and other related-party transactions were legal and properly disclosed, the spokesman said. He noted that Kice signed Beneficient&#39;s audit statement on June 14, 2019. Kice didn&#39;t respond to requests for comment.</p><p> Warnings about GWG and Beneficient began in summer 2019 and spread among executives and board directors through the fall and into 2020, long before GWG&#39;s collapse. <strong>&nbsp;</strong> The only group who didn&#39;t have a clue were nearly 28,000 mom-and-pop investors, including many retirees. This account is based on securities filings, court documents, emails and interviews with former executives, former board directors and people familiar with the matter.</p><h3> Board revolt</h3><p> Heppner, 57 years old, grew up in a Mennonite community in rural Kansas and attended Southern Methodist University in Dallas. He won a scholarship established by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/GS" class="company-name">Goldman Sachs</a> partner Charles Harmon Jr. , who became his mentor. Harmon later lent Heppner $1 million for one of Heppner&#39;s first deals, an $18 million buyout of asset-management firm Crossroads Group.</p><p> After Harmon died in 1997, his widow established a financial trust for Heppner with $5,000. Heppner put Crossroads and other financial ventures into the trust, which he referred to as the Harmon trust. In 2003, Heppner sold Crossroads and his other companies to Lehman Brothers for roughly $200 million. Most of the proceeds remained in the Harmon trust, and Heppner used some of the money to start Beneficient—a loan of roughly $140 million that was made through an affiliated trust. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Magee declined to comment. Eckian didn&#39;t respond to requests for comment.</p><p> Stein, then-president of liquor distributor Southern Glazer&#39;s, began to scrutinize Beneficient&#39;s financial documents. He teamed up with two other directors— David Glaser,</p> a former senior executive at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, and Bruce Zimmerman, now chief investment officer of billionaire Ray Dalio&#39;s family office, said people familiar with the matter.<p></p><p> They looked closely at payments made to business entities related to Heppner. Stein asked board director Tom Hicks about $9 million in such payments. Hicks said he believed the payments were proper, according to an email to Stein viewed by the Journal.</p><p> Zimmerman told others on the board in an August 2019 email that he was troubled by the payments to Heppner-related parties. Stein agreed. “Cash flow is a major problem and it is unacceptable to make payments from GWG to BEN to related parties,” he wrote in response. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Brad Heppner is seated on left, wearing glasses.</p></figcaption></figure></div><p> Heppner urged payment on the loan from the Harmon trust affiliate that had funded Beneficient, emphasizing that it was a contractual obligation. “Those trusts are fed up and want to be paid out,” Heppner said in a July 15, 2019, email to Hicks that was forwarded to Stein. “We need to be very careful on this, because they have been accommodating. That said they aren&#39;t going to be so willing anymore.”</p><p> Most of the board directors didn&#39;t realize at the time that Heppner had a substantial financial interest in the Harmon trust and its affiliates, former directors said. Heppner is a beneficiary of the trusts, which lend money to Heppner&#39;s other business ventures, according to a recent securities filing.</p><p> Heppner pressed ahead with fundraising efforts. In a Sept. 7, 2019, email to directors, he said bond sales for August had grown to nearly $50 million. “GWG doesn&#39;t want to get ahead of itself,” he wrote, “but if GWG continues to see similar levels of interest in September, I hope to be updating you about a new all-time monthly high in sales very soon.”</p><p> He noted in the email that Staubach, the former Cowboys quarterback, was scheduled to give the keynote address at an Oct. 15, 2019 finance conference in Las Vegas. “Going forward we will continue to lean on you, our directors, to be ambassadors for Ben and GWG&#39;s revamped bond program,” he wrote. Staubach declined to comment.</p><p> Board directors Glaser, Zimmerman and Stein became increasingly skeptical that Beneficient&#39;s strategy of acquiring stakes in private-equity funds from individuals would generate enough revenue to repay GWG bond investors. Fisher and Zimmerman asked Heppner for the company&#39;s financial projections in a Sept. 21, 2019, email. Heppner provided forecasts showing annual revenue was expected to grow from near zero to at least $1.7 billion by 2025.</p><p> Matters came to a head at an Oct. 10, 2019, meeting at Beneficient&#39;s headquarters in Dallas. Zimmerman, Glaser and Stein weren&#39;t persuaded that there was a basis for the bullish projections during tense discussions with Heppner, Hicks and Schnitzer. Zimmerman resigned and left the room. Glaser and Stein quit the board within days.</p><p> Two other directors, former CNBC anchor Michelle Caruso-Cabrera and Staubach, resigned months later. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

In October that year, the SEC notified GWG, the parent company of Beneficient, that it was under investigation. The federal agency requested details about Beneficient&#39;s accounting and valuation practices, as well as its transactions with related parties.</p><p> In July 2021, the SEC concluded that the accounting method Beneficient had been using was incorrect: the firm had been making loans to its own subsidiaries and counting the interest it received as revenue. That was a problem Kice had noted. Bond sales were halted until the companies corrected their financial statements.</p><p> GWG didn&#39;t disclose the extent of losses in Beneficient&#39;s private-equity investments until the companies restated their financial statements in November 2021, according to securities filings. That also was the first time they disclosed the SEC probe.</p><p> By then, GWG was on the verge of collapse. When the company tried to relaunch its bond-selling program, the SEC warned the company&#39;s broker-dealers that they, too, would be investigated if they continued to sell the bonds. Around that time, Beneficient separated as an independent company. With bond sales frozen, GWG failed to pay interest payments due in January 2022 and filed for chapter 11 that April.</p><p> In the years since linking up with Beneficient, GWG sold $1.3 billion in bonds, with much of the proceeds used to repay GWG&#39;s past investors. Beneficient received $230 million from GWG and paid at least $174 million to entities associated with Heppner. </p><div class="media-object scope-

One trust will aim to sell the roughly 170 million shares of Beneficient that GWG owns. The other trust is weighing litigation against Beneficient and its current and former directors.</p><p> Last month, Beneficient went public in a merger with a special-purpose acquisition company. The company said in securities filings and marketing materials that the transaction would value it at $3.5 billion. Beneficient ended up raising around $8 million through the SPAC deal. Its stock closed at $2.14 on Thursday, down more than 85% from its opening price on June 8.</p><p> On July 17, the company announced the launch of an online platform to encourage investors in private-equity funds to swap their assets for Beneficient stock.</p><p> Write to Alexander Gladstone at <a href="mailto:alexander.gladstone@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">alexander.gladstone@wsj.com</a></p></section></div></main></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 28 Jul 2023 09:29:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.wsj.com/articles/2-billion-default-followed-warnings-to-everyone-but-investors-fbf13873</guid><link/> https://www.wsj.com/articles/2-billion-default-followed-warnings-to-everyone-but-investors-fbf13873<author><![CDATA[Alexander Gladstone]]></author><category> gfx-contrib</category><category> leder</category><category> Trusts/Funds/Financial Vehicles</category><category>保险</category><category>Financial Investment Services</category><category> Security Brokering/Dealing</category><category> Diversified Holding Companies</category><category> Business/Consumer Services</category><category>金融服务</category><category>Investing/Securities</category><category>企业犯罪/法律诉讼</category><category>法规/政府政策</category><category>Bankruptcy</category><category> Corporate Funding</category><category> Ownership Changes</category><category> Corporate Actions</category><category>企业/行业新闻</category><category>Corporate Financial Difficulty</category><category> Private Equity/Venture Funding</category><category> Securities Regulations</category><category>政治/一般新闻</category><category>犯罪/法律诉讼</category><category>Financial Crime</category><category> Fraud</category><category> Securities Fraud</category><category>内容类型</category><category>法激活过滤器</category><category>C&amp;E 排除过滤器</category><category>C&amp;E 行政新闻过滤器</category><category>会展行业新闻过滤器</category><category>Routine General News</category><category> SYND</category><category>华尔街日报-PRO-WSJ.com</category><category> Beneficient</category><category> BENF</category><category> GWG Holdings</category><category> GWGHQ</category><category> Brad Heppner</category><category>企业犯罪</category><category>合法举动</category><category>规定</category><category>政府政策</category><category>bankruptcy</category><category> corporate funding</category><category> ownership changes</category><category> corporate actions</category><category>公司的</category><category>行业新闻</category><category>corporate financial difficulty</category><category> private equity</category><category> venture funding</category><category> securities regulations</category><category>政治的</category><category>一般新闻</category><category>犯罪</category><category>financial crime</category><category> fraud</category><category> securities fraud</category><category>内容类型</category><category>法蒂瓦过滤器</category><category>c&amp;e 排除过滤器</category><category>C&amp;E 行政新闻过滤器</category><category>会展行业新闻过滤器</category><category>routine general news</category><category> trusts</category><category> funds</category><category> financial vehicles</category><category> insurance</category><category> financial investment services</category><category> security brokering</category><category> dealing</category><category> diversified holding companies</category><category>商业</category><category>consumer services</category><category>金融服务</category><category>investing</category><category> securities</category></item></channel></rss>
