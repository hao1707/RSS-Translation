Leichter)</a>和众议员爱德华·H·莱纳 (Edward H. Lehner) 在州一级通过了这项法律。该法律适用于纽约人口超过 40 万的城市（仅指纽约市和布法罗），规定未接车的人将被处以当时<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/16/nyregion/6-years-of-canine-waste-law-all-in-all-a-cleaner-new-york.html">25 美元</a>的罚款。贝克的部分工作是向居民解释法律“并不反狗”；他认为，没有垃圾的街道对狗来说更健康，并且会让养狗更容易被接受（即房东和弗兰·李类型的人）。<br><br>尽管不可能量化任何特定时刻人行道上狗排泄物的确切数量，但贝克告诉我，法律似乎很快就扭转了局面。 “在最初的几个月里，”他说，“人们开始感觉事情变得更好了，无论是真实的还是感知的。”现在，这个曾经激进的主张已成为该国大部分地区的常态。<br><br>如今，数十年的挖掘工作已经过去，但令人沮丧的是，这项任务仍然是一个需要在全市范围内开展公关活动的问题。大多数不接电话的人<em>必须</em>明白他们所做的事情是错误的。他们知道他们会给邻居留下不卫生的麻烦，如果他们在自己的社区这样做，也会给自己留下不卫生的麻烦。那么他们为什么要这么做呢？<br><br>德国社会学家马蒂亚斯·格罗斯（Matthias Gross）对这些犯罪分子背后的动机感到好奇，因此他花了 10 年的时间来<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2015/08/doctoral-feces/">跟踪他们</a>。他在一天中的不同时间在不同城市的公园里张贴，观察人们挖水和不挖水的行为，寻找规律；这些最终成为<em>《环境社会学》</em>杂志上的一份<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23251042.2014.965402">报告</a>——《自然垃圾：犬类同伴和在公共场合不专心便便的诱惑》。<br><br> “我刚刚发现整个现象，从社会学的角度来看，非常令人着迷，”格罗斯告诉我。他发现，人们不太可能在一大早去取货，但其中一些同样不会抢购的人<em>会</em>在下午抢购。格罗斯在报告中表示，人们实际上可能并不关心保持公园清洁，而是关心被视为好公民。它让人想起公地悲剧的概念——当人们获得公共事物（在本例中是共享的社交空间）的机会时，他们往往会表现得自私。但如果每个人都自私，公共资源就会被破坏。<br><br>格罗斯写道，为了掩盖他们忽视责任的事实，许多非独家报道者假装不知道他们的狗在做什么。 （我个人多次看到过这种特殊的举动。）“我看到狗主人如何使用 iPhone 假装他们没有看到狗在做什么，”他告诉我，并补充说这些设备“非常有助于有策略地假装你不知道发生了什么。”确实如此——在这种情况和其他情况下。<br><br>但是，当然，我们实际上无法知道这些人在想什么。格罗斯的报告主要限于观察，很大程度上是因为当他与狗主人讨论为什么他们选择不捡起狗刚刚排出的东西时，他们中的许多人对他大喊大叫。有人需要找到一种方法来进入他们的思想。<br><br>克洛达·莱昂斯-巴斯蒂安（Clodagh Lyons-Bastian）现在是北卡罗来纳州立大学传播系的讲师，当她还是一名研究生时，她就试图成为那个勇敢的灵魂。当她参与的北卡罗来纳州罗利市的一个公民咨询委员会开始收到有关狗弄脏当地孩子们做运动的公园的愤怒投诉时，她决定更仔细地研究发生这种情况的原因。<br><br>在一项针对 1,000 名当地狗主人的自我报告<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chass.ncsu.edu/news/2016/05/12/the-scoop-on-dog-poop/">调查</a>中，超过 60% 的人声称，当他们留下垃圾时，是因为他们没有袋子。其他主要类别是因为下雨等外部环境，或者因为他们位于树木繁茂的地区，并认为他们可以将其推到一边并继续前进。 “实际上没有人说，‘我只是没有这样做，因为我不关心我的社区，’”里昂-巴斯蒂安告诉我。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/11/how-dogs-make-friends-for-their-humans/417645/">阅读：狗如何为人类交朋友</a><br><br>但当这些人被问到为什么他们认为<em>其他人</em>留下了狗的粪便时，他们对他们的评价要严厉得多。 “你听说过基本归因错误吗？”里昂-巴斯蒂安问我。人们倾向于将自己的行为归因于环境或无法控制的事物，而将他人的行为归因于他们的性格。<br><br>里昂-巴斯蒂安调查的第二部分重点关注什么因素可能会促使受访者更频繁地接电话。她发现答案不是罚款，也不是责骂。相反，它采用了社会证明的心理学概念，这表明人们会受到周围人的决定的影响：“如果你的社区和圈子里的人正在做某事，你就更有可能这样做。”相反，如果你认为其他人没有做某事，你很容易想知道为什么你自己要费心去做。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-power-of-us-harnessing-our-shared-identities-to-improve-performance-increase-cooperation-and-promote-social-harmony-jay-j-van-bavel/9780316538411?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《我们的力量：利用我们共同的身份来提高绩效、加强合作、促进社会和谐》一书的合著者多米尼克·帕克（</em></a> Dominic Packer）也发现了这一点。 “激励人们遵守规范的因素之一就是认同感，”他说。传达这样的信息：纽约人是一群会照顾狗的人——与所有其他失败城市的人不同——可能会奏效。他说，强调行为<em>不良</em>的人数是行不通的，这表明行为不良是常态。对于所有那些华丽的新闻发布会来说，这都是一个不幸的消息。<br><br>对于一个估计有 50 万只狗的城市来说，纽约的合规性显然很高。无论纽约人看到流浪粪便有多恼火，他们都必须承认，他们每天遇到的这种情况并不是五十万次。也许<em>真正</em>有用的不是一个标语，责骂那些为其他人毁了狗的少数狗主人，而是一个标语，上面写着：<span class="smallcaps">我们都捡便便不是很棒吗？</span><br><br>尽管许多人将狗排泄物的增加归因于流行病，这<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/07/covid-dogs-return-to-work/">似乎</a>暂时导致了狗购买和收养的增加，但市议员朱莉·梅宁认为，问题实际上与标志有关：该市在 2013 年拆除了破旧的<span class="smallcaps">狗路边</span>标志，而不是用新标志替换。她说，“人们期望人们会在没有标志的情况下清理他们的狗”。 “但事实证明事实并非如此。”<br><br>梅宁发起了一场让居民设计新标志的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abc7ny.com/curb-your-dog-design-contest-waste-winner/13377498/">竞赛</a>，她计划将其挂在她所在的地区。获奖者名单于 6 月 12 日公布：一只手持骨头和铲子的小狗自由女神像的卡通形象，<span class="smallcaps">上面写着“人人清洁街道”的口号。追随你的小狗！</span>不如我的标志建议好，但仍然很可爱。<br><br>我问她是否认为任何低于 100% 的合规性都会被她抱怨的选民所接受，她没有回答，而是强调“情况真的不会比现在更糟了。” （不幸的是，这与宇宙的中心法则直接冲突：“事情总是会变得更糟。”）<br><br>我不认为期望城市完全没有狗的排泄物是合理的，我也不相信人类的不体贴行为可以通过立法完全消除。总会有异常值：那些没有带包的人，那些真正没有注意到他们的狗在做什么的人，那些有其他我们不知道的复杂因素的人。当然，混蛋总是会有的。这个问题很棘手，因为人类是不完美的。<br><br>因此，虽然关注你刚刚踏入的粪便是很自然的，但更健康（也更有效）的是，更多地关注你从未遇到过的所有狗粪便。大多数狗主人都在外面做他们邻居的铲子，他们和你一样对那些不这样做的人感到恼火。与那些人一起说：“是的，在[你居住的地方]，我们自豪地清理我们的狗……不像那个失败者城市西雅图！”<br><br></div>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊插图；来源：盖蒂</figcaption></figure>当我在保守的福音派社区长大时，首要任务之一就是管理儿童的艺术消费。这项努力是基于一个相当简单的美学理论：每件艺术品都有一个明确的信息，消费与基督教相冲突的信息会损害一个人的信仰。有用的是，有一<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9CeHJXasrk">首歌</a>的歌词正是包含了这种美学理论：“输入输出”。<br><br><p>输入输出，<br>进去的就是出来的。<br>输入输出，<br>这就是全部内容。<br>输入输出，<br>你的头脑是一台计算机<br>每天的输入、输出你必须选择。</p>对世俗艺术作品“输入”的寻找有时会采取偏执的形式——比如相信反向记录的潜意识信息，或者在<i>《狮子王》</i>的孤立画面中，据说烟雾形成了<i>“性”</i>这个词。然而，大多数情况下，分析更为直接。描绘一种行为或描述一种信仰，除非立即伴随着明确的负面判断，否则就是一种认可和推荐，而消费此类信息的人将更有可能以这种方式行事和相信。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/evangelical-christian/418236/">阅读：定义<em>福音派</em></a><br><br>这一理论支撑了基督教当代音乐的整个大厦，其目的是取代一个特别强大的负面信息途径。多年来我经常开的玩笑之一是，现在所有排名前 40 的音乐实际上都是基督教当代音乐； <i>《美国偶像》</i>证实了“赞美乐队”的唱腔霸主地位。更清楚的是，所有主流批评——尤其是电影和电视的批评——即使在内容上不是，在形式上也是福音派的。每一件艺术品都被认为有一个明确的信息；对特定行为或信念的描述是认可和推荐；对带有特定信息的艺术品的消费将直接导致所描绘的行为或信念。这是“双方”陈词滥调真实存在的少数现象之一：左翼批评者和右翼对手一样有可能这样做。对于像<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynU-wVdesr0&amp;pp=ygUfYmVuIHNoYXBpcm8gYmFyYmllIG1vdmllIHJldmlldw%3D%3D">本·夏皮罗</a>这样的右翼煽动者谴责<i>芭比娃娃</i>的过度行为的每一个视频，都会有一篇评论称赞美泰产品的搭配是<a data-event-element="inline

href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/23/barbie-review-greta-gerwig-margot-robbie-ryan-riotous-candy-coloured-feminist-fable">女权主义寓言</a>。<br><br>但在这里，我更关心的是左翼同志的批评做法。在左派出版物中，<i>雅各宾</i>以其还原性和道德化的文化报道而脱颖而出。例如，评论家艾琳·琼斯<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jacobin.com/2023/07/christopher-nolan-oppenheimer-film-review">在最近的一篇专栏中</a>谈到上周末的另一部主要电影时担心，“如果你已经相信核战争的危险，而核战争的危险只会被持续不断的末世气候灾难所取代，而这些灾难现在看来更有可能杀死我们所有人，那么这部电影将缺乏一定的紧迫性。”可悲的是，电影观众看到的不是一部关于核战争的教育片，而是一部为了打造一部好莱坞大片而对其主题的生活和性格进行了一些自由的传记片。琼斯<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jacobin.com/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-mattel-consumerism-feminism">发现</a><i>芭比娃娃</i>更让人喜欢，尽管“美泰几十年来一直在利用那种熟悉的、没牙的、随心所欲的伪女权主义虔诚，以及怀旧的‘我们的消费品怎么可能是坏的’，芭比娃娃是几代母亲和女儿们的某种神奇的、健康进步的统一体。”<br><br>这一趋势并不局限于一份出版物。它在网络文化中普遍存在，尤其是在社交媒体上。例如，周五<i>巴本海默</i>史诗般的比赛结束后的第二天早上，我在喝咖啡时，在推特上了解到了一些关于<i>奥本海默</i>的令人不安的事实。至少有一位观众担心这部关于制造核弹的人的电影中没有<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/anthonyocampo/status/1682406287555055618">任何日本角色</a>。事实上，它甚至没有直接描述他的发明的可怕后果。当然，这种审美选择是为了通过让受害者隐形来最小化他的行为。 （ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/07/who-are-the-japanese-in-christopher-nolans-oppenheimer.html"><i>《纽约》</i>杂志</a>上的一篇文章引起了人们对同样缺席的关注。）我还<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/AlisaValdesRod1/status/1682167160364494849">了解到</a>， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tewawomenunited.org/2023/07/oppenheimer-and-the-other-side-of-the-story">洛斯阿拉莫斯周围的地区实际上已经清除了原住民和西班牙裔居民</a>，这是这部电影有效抹除的另一段历史。<br><br> <a

2021 年，Appen 评级人员开始与 Alphabet 工人联盟 - 美国通信工人组织合作，推动获得更大的认可和补偿；柯蒂斯去年加入了这个行列。这场斗争的核心是一个大问题：在即将到来的人工智能时代，从事科技行业繁重工作的人们能否被视为和对待，而不是不知疲倦的机器，而只是将其视为人类？<br><br>使用此类评级来改进人工智能模型的<span class="smallcaps">技术名称</span>是<em>人类反馈强化学习</em>（RLHF）。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/research/instruction-following">OpenAI</a> 、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-safer-dialogue-agents">Google</a> 、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www-files.anthropic.com/production/images/Model-Card-Claude-2.pdf">Anthropic</a>和其他公司都使用该技术。聊天机器人处理大量文本后，人类反馈有助于对其进行微调。 ChatGPT 令人印象深刻，因为使用它感觉就像与人聊天，但这种模仿并不是通过从<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/">整个互联网</a>（食谱、专利、博客和小说的混合体）中摄取数据而自然产生的。尽管人工智能程序在模式检测方面是有效的，但它们“没有任何上下文理解能力，无法解析人工智能生成的文本是否看起来或多或少像人类会写的内容，”独立研究机构 AI Now Institute 的董事总经理莎拉·迈尔斯·韦斯特 (Sarah Myers West) 告诉我。只有真实的人才能拨打这个电话。<br><br>该程序可能会编写多种巧克力蛋糕食谱，由评估者对其进行排名和编辑。这些评估和示例将为聊天机器人的语言统计模型和下一个单词预测提供信息，这将使该程序更好地以人类的风格编写巧克力蛋糕等食谱。人们可能会检查聊天机器人的响应的事实准确性，评估它与提示的契合程度，或者标记有毒的输出；学科专家可能特别有帮助，而且他们的薪水往往更高。<br><br>使用人类评估来改进算法产品在这一点上是一种相当古老的做法：机器学习公司 Hugging Face 的人工智能研究员 Sasha Luccioni 告诉我，谷歌和 Facebook 已经使用它们来开发<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9281931">搜索引擎</a>、 <a data-event-element="inline

href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/204798856225114?id=649869995454285">定向广告</a>和其他产品近十年了，甚至更久。然而，人类评分对当今算法的影响程度取决于你问的是谁。设计搜索引擎、聊天机器人和其他算法产品并从中获利的大型科技公司往往将评估者的工作视为构建尖端人工智能产品的众多重要方面之一。谷歌发言人考特尼·门奇尼 (Courtenay Mencini) 告诉我，“评级不会直接影响或仅仅训练我们的算法。相反，它们只是一个数据点……与广泛的内部开发和测试相结合。” OpenAI<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">强调</a>，GPT-4 的大部分功能是针对大量文本（而不是 RLHF）进行训练。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt-gpt-4/674764/">摘自 2023 年 9 月号：Sam Altman 知道他在创造什么吗？</a><br><br>我与这些公司之外的人工智能专家交谈过，他们采取了不同的立场。 Luccioni 表示，有针对性的人类反馈是“使[当前]人工智能模型变得如此优秀的最有影响力的改变”，使得从 GPT-2 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953040/openai-text-generation-ai-gpt-2-full-model-release-1-5b-parameters">不成熟的</a>电子邮件跃升至 GPT-4 <a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-safer-dialogue-agents">表示</a>，“为了创建更安全的对话代理，我们需要能够从人类反馈中学习。”谷歌也类似地将人类评估<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/raters-experiments-improve-google-search/">描述</a>为其搜索引擎所必需的。该公司宣称 RLHF 将其人工智能服务应用于医疗保健和金融等行业“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-cloud-launches-new-ai-models-opens-generative-ai-studio">特别有用</a>”。 OpenAI 的两位首席研究人员在接受<em>《麻省理工科技评论》</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/03/1069311/inside-story-oral-history-how-chatgpt-built-openai/">采访</a>时也同样表示，人类评估对于训练 ChatGPT 至关重要。 The company stated elsewhere that GPT-4 exhibited “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf">large improvements</a> ” in accuracy after RLHF training and that human feedback was crucial to fine-tuning it. Meta&#39;s most recent language model, released this week, relies on “over 1 million new human annotations,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/">according to the company</a> .<br><br> To some extent, the significance of humans&#39; AI ratings is evident in the money pouring into them. One company that hires people to do RLHF and data annotation was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/sclae-ai-disruptor-50.html">valued</a> at more than $7 billion in 2021, and its CEO recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/alexandr_wang/status/1620934510820093952?lang=en">predicted</a> that AI companies will soon spend billions of dollars on RLHF, similar to their investment in computing power. The global market for labeling data used to train these models (such as tagging an image of a cat with the label “cat”), another part of the “ghost work” powering AI, could <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/20/1050392/ai-industry-appen-scale-data-labels/">reach</a> nearly $14 billion by 2030, according to an estimate from April 2022, months before the ChatGPT gold rush began.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">ll of that money</span> , however, rarely seems to be reaching the actual people doing the ghostly labor. The contours of the work are starting to materialize, and the few public investigations into it are alarming: Workers in Africa are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6275995/chatgpt-facebook-african-workers-union/">paid as little as $1.50 an hour</a> to check outputs for disturbing content that has reportedly left some of them with PTSD. Some contractors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots">in the US</a> can earn only a couple of dollars above the minimum wage for repetitive, exhausting, and rudderless work. The pattern is similar to that of social-media content moderators, who can be paid a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">tenth as much as software engineers</a> to scan traumatic content for hours every day. “The poor working conditions directly impact data quality,” Krystal Kauffman, a fellow at the Distributed AI Research Institute and an organizer of raters and data labelers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform, told me.<br><br> Stress, low pay, minimal instructions, inconsistent tasks, and tight deadlines—the sheer volume of data needed to train AI models almost necessitates a rush job—are a recipe for human error, according to Appen raters affiliated with the Alphabet Workers Union-Communications Workers of America and multiple independent experts. Documents <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-12/google-s-ai-chatbot-is-trained-by-humans-who-say-they-re-overworked-underpaid-and-frustrated">obtained</a> by <em>Bloomberg</em> , for instance, show that AI raters at Google have as little as three minutes to complete some tasks, and that they evaluate high-stakes responses, such as how to safely dose medication. Even OpenAI has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf">written</a> , in the technical report accompanying GPT-4, that “undesired behaviors [in AI systems] can arise when instructions to labelers were underspecified” during RLHF.<br><br> Tech companies have at times responded to these issues by stating that ratings are not the only way they check accuracy, that humans doing those ratings are paid <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots">adequately</a> based on their location and afforded proper training, and that viewing traumatic materials is not a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">typical</a> experience. Mencini, the Google spokesperson, told me that Google&#39;s wages and benefits standards for contractors do not apply to raters, because they “work part-time from home, can be assigned to multiple companies&#39; accounts at a time, and do not have access to Google&#39;s systems or campuses.” In response to allegations of raters seeing offensive materials, she said that workers “select to opt into reviewing sensitive content, and can opt out freely at any time.” The companies also tend to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/14/google-ai-bard-raters-chatbot-accuracy/">shift blame</a> to their <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6147458/facebook-africa-content-moderation-employee-treatment/">vendors</a> —Mencini, for instance, told me that “Google is simply not the employer of any Appen workers.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/07/generative-ai-human-culture-philosophy/674165/">Read: The coming humanist renaissance</a><br><br> Appen&#39;s raters told me that their working conditions do not align with various tech companies&#39; assurances—and that they hold Appen and Google responsible, because both profit from their work. Over the past year, Michelle Curtis and other raters have demanded more time to complete AI evaluations, benefits, better compensation, and the right to organize. The job&#39;s flexibility does have advantages, they told me. Curtis has been able to navigate her children&#39;s medical issues; another Appen rater I spoke with, Ed Stackhouse, said the adjustable hours afford him time to deal with a heart condition. But flexibility does not justify low pay and a lack of benefits, Shannon Wait, an organizer with the AWU-CWA, told me; there&#39;s nothing flexible about precarity.<br><br> The group made headway at the start of the year, when Curtis and her fellow raters received their first-ever raise. She now makes $14.50 an hour, up from $12.75—still below the minimum of $15 an hour that Google has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://about.google/extended-workforce/">promised</a> to its vendors, temporary staff, and contractors. The union continued raising concerns about working conditions; Stackhouse wrote a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1658489222695915522">letter</a> to Congress about these issues in May. Then, just over two weeks later, Curtis, Stackhouse, and several other raters received an email from Appen stating, “Your employment is being terminated due to business conditions.”<br><br> The AWU-CWA suspected that Appen and Google were punishing the raters for speaking out.  “The raters that were let go all had one thing in common, which was that they were vocal about working conditions or involved in organizing,” Stackhouse told me. Although Appen did suffer a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://s41256.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Appen_AR22_Interactive_v-final.pdf">drop</a> in revenue during the broader tech downturn last year, the company also had, and has, open job postings. Four weeks before the termination, Appen had sent an email offering cash incentives to work more hours and meet “a significant spike in jobs available since the beginning of year,” when the generative-AI boom was in full swing; just six days before the layoffs, Appen sent another email lauding “record-high production levels” and re-upping the bonus-pay offer. On June 14, the union filed a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-320053">complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Appen and Google had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/14/google-ai-bard-raters-chatbot-accuracy/">retaliated</a> against raters “by terminating six employees who were engaged in protected [labor] activity.”<br><br> Less than two weeks after the complaint was filed, Appen reversed its decision to fire Curtis, Stackhouse, and the others; their positions were reinstated with back pay. Ahmad, Appen&#39;s CEO, told me in an email that his company bases “employment decisions on business requirements” and is “happy that our business needs changed and we were able to hire back the laid off contributors.” He added, “Our policy is not to discriminate against employees due to any protected labor activities,” and that “we&#39;ve been actively investing in workplace enhancements like smarter training, and improved benefits.”<br><br> Mencini, the Google spokesperson, told me that “only Appen, as the employer, determines their employees&#39; working conditions,” and that “Appen provides job training for their employees.” As with compensation and training, Mencini deflected responsibility for the treatment of organizing workers as well: “We, of course, respect the labor rights of Appen employees to join a union, but it&#39;s a matter between them and their employer, Appen.”<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">hat AI purveyors would obscure</span> the human labor undergirding their products is predictable. Much of the data that train AI models is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-exploited-labor-behind-artificial-intelligence/">labeled by people</a> making poverty wages, many of them located in the global South. Amazon deliveries are cheap in part because <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/15/us/amazon-workers.html">working conditions</a> in the company&#39;s warehouses subsidize them. Social media is usable and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation">desirable</a> because of armies of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/25/social-media-companies-are-outsourcing-their-dirty-work-philippines-generation-workers-is-paying-price/">content moderators</a> also largely in the global South. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-cloud-computing">“Cloud” computing</a> , a cornerstone of Amazon&#39;s and Microsoft&#39;s businesses, takes place in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.blackstone.com/insights/article/greg-blank-mike-forman-on-demand-for-data-centers/">giant data centers</a> .<br><br> AI raters might be understood as an extension of that cloud, treated not as laborers with human needs so much as productive units, carbon transistors on a series of fleshly microchips—objects, not people. Yet even microchips take up space; they require not just electricity but also ventilation to keep from overheating. The Appen raters&#39; termination and reinstatement is part of “a more generalized pattern within the tech industry of engaging in very swift retaliation against workers” when they organize for better pay or against ethical concerns about the products they work on, Myers West, of the AI Now Institute, told me.<br><br> Ironically, one crucial bit of human labor that AI programs have proved unable to automate is their own training. Human subjectivity and prejudice have long migrated their way into algorithms, and those flaws mean machines may not be able to perfect themselves. Various attempts to train AI models with other AI models have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/generative-ai-future-training-models/674478/">bred further bias</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03277">worsened</a> performance, though a few have shown <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03047.pdf">limited</a> success. “I can&#39;t imagine that we will be able to replicate [human intervention] with current AI approaches,” Hugging Face&#39;s Luccioni told me in an email; Ahmad said that “using AI to train AI can have dire consequences as it pertains to the viability and credibility of this technology.” The tech industry has so far failed to purge the ghosts haunting its many other machines and services—the people organizing on warehouse floors, walking out of corporate headquarters, unionizing overseas, and leaking classified documents. Appen&#39;s raters are proving that, even amid the generative-AI boom, humanity may not be so easily exorcized.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/ai-chatbot-human-evaluator-feedback/674805/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/ai-chatbot-human-evaluator-feedback/674805/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ascendence of Girl Culture]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> <em>Barbie</em> purports to be critical of Mattel while being enthusiastically sponsored by Mattel. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/x-xsz1KnKkOjhSGRth3GJNsRuTg=/235x0:2763x1422/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/MCDBARB_WB037/original.jpg" alt="An image of Margot Robbie as Barbie" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> In the 2000s, male artists routinely excavated the popular culture of their boyhood for imaginative repurposing in their art. Michael Chabon&#39;s novel <i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</i> traces the lives of two men who become comic-book creators. In Jonathan Lethem&#39;s <i>The</i> <i>Fortress of Solitude</i> , two boys find a magic ring they use to take on superpowers; the title itself evokes the fictional fortress of Superman. Back then, I remember feeling that the equivalent was not possible for women artists, that the popular culture of American girlhood (horses, dolls, gymnastics) was still considered silly, juvenile—impossible to recuperate as adult art worth taking seriously.<br><br> Greta Gerwig seems at last a counterexample. Her entire career as a filmmaker has, in a sense, been a campaign to make art of girlhood materials. Her 2019 film, <i>Little Women</i> , remakes the 19th-century girlhood classic, rendering it freshly urgent for a 21st-century audience. (“I&#39;ve been angry every day of my life,” Marmee, the saintly mother of the novel, says in Gerwig&#39;s version.) Her directorial debut, <i>Lady Bird</i> (2017), captures the angst of a 17-year-old girl&#39;s coming-of-age in all its granular reality, taking seriously adolescent longing and anger.<br><br> And now here is the <i>Barbie</i> juggernaut. <i>Barbie</i> dominated the box office on its opening weekend, grossing a stunning $155 million: a post-pandemic high, and the biggest opening for any feature film directed by a woman. Grown-up art about girlhood really can be an economic and cultural powerhouse. In the past week, women I barely know and women I have known for years have texted me their excitement about the film—and then shared their response, which has been in many cases the same: They <i>loved</i> watching the film, and yet more than one felt oddly disappointed by it.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-greta-gerwig-interview/674817/">Read: Greta Gerwig&#39;s lessons from Barbie land</a><br><br> Perhaps this is because, as the critic Dana Stevens <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/culture/2023/07/barbie-movie-2023-margot-robbie-ryan-gosling-review.html">noted in <i>Slate</i></a> , <i>Barbie</i> “never completely resolves the paradox at its heart”: The movie purports to be critical of Mattel while being enthusiastically sponsored by Mattel. The constraint is so obvious that Gerwig tries to turn it into a joke. The plot hinges on the conceit that all the Barbies mistakenly believe that their existence has turned the “real” world into a feminist paradise. But Gerwig knows that no one wants to watch a hectoring film about how the doll is bad for girls&#39; self-image. So she subversively jokes about the insidious side of corporate culture while visually celebrating the Barbieness of Barbie. In this way, <i>Barbie</i> really is, if not a wholly successful film, certainly a powerful monument to the strangeness of American girl culture, which remains impoverished in its vision of what young girls are and want.<br><br> At once a commercial for a toy and a delicious romp through the pleasures of childhood play, <i>Barbie</i> sits uneasily at the intersection of reality, fantasy, and critique. It is joyous, winking, frothily cinematic. There are lavish costumes, deftly choreographed dance numbers, and aesthetically sophisticated visual puns. Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, is wryly known as “Stereotypical Barbie”; blond and perfect, she showers and drinks without ever getting wet, walks on her toes, floats down from her bedroom to the street as if held by an invisible girl&#39;s hand. The script is peppered with genuinely incisive and funny skewers of gender stereotypes. A key moment in the plot involves the Barbies allowing the Kens to “sing at them” while playing guitars; the preposition is pure genius.<br><br> Like many women before it, <i>Barbie</i> tries to be many things to many people. One trailer&#39;s tag line was “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.” The line gets at the challenge here, adjacent to the one Stevens identified: How do you make a film for an audience that remains fiercely divided about the material you&#39;re writing about?<br><br> This conflict, one might say, is precisely what forces Stereotypical Barbie out of her dreamy pink home on a quest to understand a series of strange phenomena: cellulite, cold showers, melancholy. We meet Barbie in Barbie Land, where women rule, literally. There is a Barbie president; there are nine Supreme Court Barbies. Kens are reduced to supporting roles. They wait for Barbies to kiss them, notice them, long for them. But when Barbie begins having relentless thoughts of death, she and one of the Kens, played to deliciously banal perfection by Ryan Gosling, enter “reality.” It isn&#39;t the paradise she expected; men ogle her and a girl calls her a “fascist.” As reality&#39;s reality dawns on Barbie, she articulates a set of feelings at once amusingly framed and horrifying to witness: “I feel … ill at ease,” she says. “I&#39;m getting undertones of violence.” (Cue women squirming in the audience.) Meanwhile, Ken is radicalized by his experience: He likes the attention he gets. He sees a new world, one where men are not second-class citizens, and returns to Barbie Land to brainwash the Barbies into serving the Kens. The former Supreme Court justices are now cheerleaders.<br><br> Rather than get angry at what has happened to Barbie Land, Barbie is crushed. She stops wearing makeup and lies on the floor in despair, waiting for another Barbie to take the lead in fixing her society. And so the second half of the film tells the somewhat incoherent story of her evolution from thinking she is not “good enough” to becoming a woman bent on self-determination. In the real world, she befriends a real woman named Gloria (America Ferrara), who delivers an impassioned motivational speech about how hard it is to be a woman in a world that demands contradictory things: to care tirelessly for your children but not talk about them too much; to act when action seems fruitless.<br><br> The challenge that Barbie, as a cultural object, presents Gerwig is how to mine the performative pleasures of clothes and dance numbers alongside the travesties of modern American culture while framing the story as if the two are wholly disconnected. She&#39;s trying to show what it might really be like to go from a dream land to contemporary America, where <i>Roe v. Wade</i> has been overturned, parents still don&#39;t automatically get parental leave after the birth of a child, and most CEOs of corporations (including Mattel) are still men.<br><br> <i>Barbie</i> is at once radical and conventional. It is radical in its light indictment of the patriarchy: One of the very best lines of cultural criticism I&#39;ve heard in ages comes when Ken says, “To be honest, when I found out the patriarchy wasn&#39;t about horses I lost interest.” (The movie might be best read as a brilliant portrait of aggrieved far-right masculinity.) It is somewhat more conventional in its vision of a dream girlhood and its idea of what Barbie <i>is</i> . And perhaps here is where Mattel&#39;s influence is strongest. Despite the presence of Doctor Barbies and Supreme Court Barbies, Gerwig&#39;s Barbies still largely conform to rigid beauty norms; a night of fun is a dance number in glittery and sexy clothes; and no conflict ever occurs, because the days are coated in a vapid gloss of fashion and pink plastic that corporate America has always been selling girls. This is the vision that led my second-wave-feminist mother to ban Barbie from our house. When my aunt gave me two for my fifth birthday, they mysteriously disappeared a few days later.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">Read: The surprising key to understanding the Barbie film</a><br><br> To some degree, this vapidity is Gerwig&#39;s point: Barbie must leave Barbie Land, as all girls must, to confront a messier and more complex reality. And yet <i>Barbie</i> skirts the deep cognitive dissonance the doll inspires in many girls. Thanks to my mother&#39;s ban, I played with Barbie only at friends&#39; houses. I recall finding the doll boring, because she was relentlessly tethered to <i>our</i> world and to the culture&#39;s expectations for adult me, ones that didn&#39;t yet interest me (boys, houses, Malibu). Instead of playing Barbie, my friends and I disfigured her so she looked like the film&#39;s Weird Barbie (Kate MacKinnon), a doll with a 1980s punk haircut who&#39;s out of step with all the others. Like the montage in the film showing what a girl did to Weird Barbie, we chopped off her hair down to chunky sprouts, turned her head backward, covered her face in green marker. In the film&#39;s lingo, Weird Barbie is weird because girls have “played too hard” with her, a telling evasion. Weird Barbie is not weird because someone played too hard with her. Weird Barbie is weird, as Gerwig surely knows, because some girl used her to express all her frustration at the confection of materialism and reductive beauty norms. Weird Barbie wants to raze Barbie Land, not just help Stereotypical Barbie see reality for what it is.<br><br> <i>Barbie</i> is a fascinating moment in the ascendance of girl culture, a brilliantly twisty dive into the core of the contradictory scripts shaping what it is like to grow up as a girl in America. One of those scripts teaches that girlhood isn&#39;t a space of imaginative autonomy but a kind of prep school for a conventional consumer adulthood that will be shaped by hair appointments, shopping, and a job. Despite the constraints she faces, Gerwig tries to invoke a more capacious script for girlhood at the film&#39;s end, in a beautiful montage of girls playing around the world, in muted visuals that starkly contrast with the Technicolor Barbie world. If the film emerges aesthetically scathed, that doesn&#39;t mean it is a failure. I left delighted by how much Gerwig had achieved through humor, and by the conviction that <i>Barbie</i> can only help make room for more films by women about women. The film&#39;s tag line is right. One can hate Barbie and still be glad this movie was made, because here it is at last: a movie full of jokes for us, the women and girls in the room. In that sense, nothing about <i>Barbie</i> is silly or juvenile.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-girlhood-greta-gerwig/674821/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-girlhood-greta-gerwig/674821/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Elite-College Admissions Matter]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A conversation with Annie Lowrey about how to diversify these schools—and by extension, America&#39;s elite <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6uJxUOZ3NbpIGfYTL90DBaP8PEY=/127x0:2259x1199/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/image_3/original.png" alt="College campus" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> ccahill / Getty</figcaption></figure> <small><i>This is an edition of</i> The Atlantic <i>Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a></small><br><br> Attendance at an elite college increases a student&#39;s chances of joining America&#39;s most elite ranks, according to a new study. I chatted with my colleague Annie Lowrey, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">who reported</a> on this new research yesterday, about how to diversify the student bodies of America&#39;s wealthiest schools—and, by extension, the whole of elite America.<br><br> First, here are three new stories from <em>The Atlantic</em> :<br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-evangelical-church-division-politics/674810/">The American evangelical Church is in crisis.

The study, conducted by Raj Chetty of Harvard, David Deming of Harvard, and John Friedman of Brown University, looked at waitlisted students&#39; outcomes and showed that compared with attending one of America&#39;s best public colleges, attending a member of what&#39;s known as the “Ivy Plus” group—the Ivies plus Stanford, MIT, Duke, and the University of Chicago—increases a student&#39;s chances of reaching the top of the earnings distribution at age 33 by 60 percent.<br><br> The finding is not actually so obvious. Over the past two decades, a body of research has shown that students&#39; average incomes end up about the same after they graduate from a flagship public institution versus an Ivy Plus school. The new study <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf#page=4">confirms this finding</a> about average incomes, but it complicates the bigger picture: When it comes to other metrics of life in the American elite—“Supreme Court clerkships, going to a tippy-top graduate program, making it into the top 1 percent of earners at the age of 33”—schools such as Harvard and Yale matter a lot. “In general, [elite schools have] this propulsive quality,” Annie told me.<br><br> White students and, to an even greater extent, wealthy students are overrepresented at many elite colleges, and the question of how these schools can diversify has become even more urgent since the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to curtail affirmative action. But this new study suggests that elite schools can enact some straightforward policies to diversify themselves and, in the process, the makeup of elite America. Annie and I talked through two of these possibilities.<br><br> <b>Disbanding legacy admissions:</b> Systems that give preference to the children of university alumni have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bowman.house.gov/2022/2/news-rep-jamaal-bowman-sen-jeff-merkley-introduce-legacy-admissions-reform-bill">come under scrutiny</a> in recent years, and this scrutiny has intensified since last month&#39;s Supreme Court ruling. Today, the Education Department said <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/us/politics/harvard-admissions-civil-rights-inquiry.html">it has opened</a> a civil-rights investigation into Harvard&#39;s legacy-admissions practices. And last week, Wesleyan University (my own alma mater) declared an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4105550-wesleyan-university-ending-legacy-admissions-after-supreme-court-ruling/">end</a> to its use of legacy preferences.<br><br><p role="presentation"> The new paper from Chetty and his co-authors confirms that the effects of legacy admissions are real, and that they&#39;re particularly strong for the highest-income students. The data show that legacy students whose parents are in the top 1 percent of the earnings distribution are 5 times more likely to be admitted to an Ivy Plus school compared with non-legacy students with equivalent test scores. Meanwhile, less wealthy legacy students are 3 times more likely to be admitted.</p> When I asked Annie if she thought the decline of legacy admissions at elite schools is a real possibility (MIT is the only school out of the Ivy Plus group studied that doesn&#39;t use legacy preferences), she noted that this is quickly becoming a public-policy issue: President Joe Biden <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/29/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-decision-on-affirmative-action/#:~:text=We%20can%20and%20must%20do,expand%20privilege%20instead%20of%20opportunity.">came out against</a> the practice after the Supreme Court ruling, and according to polling, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/04/26/u-s-public-continues-to-view-grades-test-scores-as-top-factors-in-college-admissions/">about three-quarters</a> of Americans think colleges shouldn&#39;t use legacy preferences. Universities might start to rethink their use of the practice if their presidents start getting asked about it over and over again, Annie said, “and if you start to have members of Congress saying, &#39;Do we need to be giving these institutions all of this research funding and all of these nice tax breaks if they&#39;re just picking rich kids and giving them more advantage?&#39;”<br><br> President Biden is a particularly interesting political figure for this moment: As Annie reminded me, Biden was purportedly not a very good student, and he did not attend an elite college, as many past presidents did (he went to the University of Delaware). Meanwhile, many members of Congress come from elite colleges themselves, Annie noted: “The thing that will be most interesting is if this becomes political, and for whom does it become political?”<br><br><p role="presentation"> <b>Increasing class sizes:</b> I asked Annie to elaborate on a surprisingly simple argument she makes at the end of her article, one that isn&#39;t explicitly covered in the Chetty research: Elite schools might just matriculate more students. “These schools have not grown with the growth of the United States population or the population of 18-year-olds,” she told me. We pulled up the statistics together over the phone: These Ivy Plus schools graduate about 23,000 students a year combined. Meanwhile, there are about 4 million 18-year-olds in America in any given year. Of course, not all of those kids are going to go to college. But 23,000 is “a drop in the bucket,” Annie said.</p><p role="presentation"> These schools have tremendous financial resources—a combined endowment of more than $200 billion for those Ivy Plus schools. Moreover, many of these schools spend lavishly on what are essentially “real-estate concerns,” such as sports facilities and dining halls, Annie said: “The notion that they couldn&#39;t be educating many, many, many more kids is risible.”</p><p role="presentation"> <b>Related:</b></p><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Why you have to care about these 12 colleges</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/affirmative-action-supreme-court-college-admissions-essays-trauma/674314/">A big problem with college admissions could be about to get worse.</a></li> <strong>Today&#39;s News</strong><br><br><li> The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has called off <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/25/1189956641/ups-union-calls-off-strike-threat-after-securing-pay-raises-for-workers">a nationwide strike</a> threat after securing a tentative five-year agreement with UPS leadership.</li><li> Qin Gang <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/25/china/china-foreign-minister-qin-gang-replaced-wang-yi-intl-hnk/index.html">was ousted</a> from his role as China&#39;s foreign minister after a month-long absence from public view.

Industry analysts will predict doom for the future of cinema for months, then exult when a new release defies expectations. This summer has been no exception: A few blockbusters such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/06/the-flash-production-issues-muschietti/674334/"><em>The Flash</em></a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/06/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-review/674509/"><em>Indiana Jones</em></a> underperformed, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/04/2023-movie-box-office-needs-strong-second-half-after-inconsistent-start.html">hand-wringing</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/disney-box-office-failures-indiana-jones-elemental-ant-man-1235660409/">quickly ensued</a> . But last weekend brought a colossal turnaround, thanks to <em>Barbenheimer</em> —the head-to-head releases of Greta Gerwig&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/"><em>Barbie</em></a> and Christopher Nolan&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/"><em>Oppenheimer</em></a> . The two films are diametrically different, auteur-driven works that doubled their individual expected grosses and together fueled the fourth-biggest opening weekend in history. The summer could be saved! And yet, with actor and writer <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywoods-cruel-strategy/674730/">strikes</a> ongoing, studios seem almost hell-bent on dashing any chance at real industry momentum.<br><br> The strategy of pitting <em>Barbie</em> against <em>Oppenheimer</em> initially seemed risky. But the disparity between Gerwig&#39;s hot-pink, brand-name comedy and Nolan&#39;s R-rated, three-hour biographical epic generated its own hype. In the end, <em>Barbie</em> opened to $162 million and <em>Oppenheimer</em> to $82 million—the former is a record for a film directed by a woman, and Nolan landed his biggest weekend ever for a non-Batman movie.<br><br> This is a huge, heartening success for the film industry, after months of commercially unimpressive sequels. More than anything, it&#39;s a clear sign that audiences are hungry for good products. Blockbusters aren&#39;t obsolete, but studios can&#39;t just rely on the latest franchise entry; some established players (such as DC Comics and <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> ) are starting to lose their luster. <em>Barbie</em> and <em>Oppenheimer</em> earned their audiences&#39; fervor by getting positive reviews and offering something truly compelling: <em>Barbie</em> is very funny and joyous to see with a crowd; <em>Oppenheimer</em> is visually overwhelming and boosting its sales on large, premium screens such as IMAX. Both films got Grade A CinemaScores, a good indicator of word of mouth, so the box office should remain healthy through August.<br><br> Still, there&#39;s trouble around the corner, the first example of which also came last weekend. <em>Challengers</em> , a fun and frothy-looking romantic tennis dramedy starring Zendaya, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/zendaya-challengers-actors-strike-release-date-1235444723/">changed its release date</a> from September 15 to April 26 of next year, canceling its planned release at the Venice Film Festival. The film, directed by Luca Guadagnino ( <em>Call Me by Your Name</em> ), was going to get a splashy push in theaters from MGM, but the Screen Actors Guild strike means that Zendaya and her co-stars might not be able to promote it, which would create difficulties for a project reliant on star power.<br><br> Several other projects have already been delayed because of the strike, including A24&#39;s indie comedy <em>Problemista</em> , Lionsgate&#39;s inspirational drama <em>White Bird</em> , and a <em>Dirty Dancing</em> sequel. But the real dominoes could fall next, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/dune-2-release-date-change-2024-warner-bros-strike-1235676007/">rumors brewing</a> that Warner Bros. might punt its biggest upcoming releases— <em>Dune Part Two</em> , <em>The Color Purple</em> , and <em>Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom</em> —off the 2023 calendar. Other big movies planned for the fall include Martin Scorsese&#39;s <em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em> , superhero entry <em>The Marvels</em> , and a <em>Hunger Games</em> prequel, all of which will need stars on the press circuit to propel their sales. (The casts of <em>Barbie</em> and <em>Oppenheimer</em> did many of their media interviews before they went on strike.)<br><br> A crisis isn&#39;t just brewing; it&#39;s here. Every day that movie studios don&#39;t resume negotiations with SAG and the Writers Guild of America jeopardizes the future of Hollywood. Much of the existential anxiety about cinema was exacerbated by the years of delays that COVID created: More films were distributed to streaming services, and audiences got used to viewing new releases at home. Now people are comfortable going to the movies again, and the <em>Barbenheimer</em> phenomenon is reminding theatergoers of all ages of the value of a big-screen experience. Not capitalizing on that energy would be a catastrophic mistake.<br><br> Yet it seems to be a mistake that the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (the loose trade association representing major studios) is willing to make. The WGA has been on strike for 84 days, with no sign of negotiations resuming anytime soon. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/writers-strike-hollywood-studios-deal-fight-wga-actors-1235434335/"><em>Deadline</em> article</a> citing an anonymous “top-tier producer” predicted that the studios would allow the standoff to last at least until October. The AMPTP pushed back, claiming that it was “committed to reaching a deal.” Regardless, the reporting underlined how toxic the dynamic between the WGA and the studios has become; residuals, the use of generative AI, and the sharing of streaming data are all significant points of disagreement.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywoods-cruel-strategy/674730/">Read: The businessmen broke Hollywood</a><br><br> The entertainment industry has weathered many WGA strikes over the years, but SAG&#39;s action was more surprising and immediately influential, basically shutting down all major movie productions and affecting future release calendars. Many of the same issues, particularly streaming residuals and AI, are at stake in both sets of negotiations, which is probably why the AMPTP is loath to strike a quick bargain with SAG—it is aware that the WGA could use that as leverage. Instead, Hollywood honchos seem committed to a death spiral, unsure of how to drive a deal beyond inflicting punishment both on the unions and on themselves.<br><br> At this point, almost any delay in resolving the strikes could be borderline apocalyptic for the film industry. If the studios hold off on negotiations for months, trying to force the unions to desperation, those studios&#39; products will end up being held from cinemas, overall ticket sales will plummet, and what might have been Hollywood&#39;s best chance at reaching pre-pandemic levels of success will slip away. <em>Barbie</em> and <em>Oppenheimer</em> will continue to sell tickets, yes, and a few action films in August ( <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> , <em>Meg 2</em> ) should enjoy modest success, but all of the corporate back-patting about the box office going on right now will be quickly forgotten. Hollywood just got its clearest confirmation since 2019 that movies can still draw an in-person audience. It would be a good idea to keep releasing them.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 20:45:43 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbenheimer-movie-theaters-hollywood-strikes/674822/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbenheimer-movie-theaters-hollywood-strikes/674822/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Greta Gerwig’s Lessons From Barbie Land]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> “You&#39;re interested in what you&#39;re interested in, and I&#39;m interested in women.” <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/HQCGi0UhG3lSR1FkaVTU_9EwfVQ=/0x0:2160x2700/648x810/media/img/2023/07/25/greta_gerwig_1/original.jpg" alt="格蕾塔·葛韦格的黑白肖像，双手捧着脸" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Jody Rogac / Trunk Archive</figcaption></figure> <strong><em>This article contains spoilers for the film</em></strong> <strong>Barbie <em>.</em></strong><br><br> As soon as I asked a question about Ken, my call with Greta Gerwig dropped. When the writer-director of <em>Barbie</em> returned, she had no idea what happened. I suggested that of <em>course</em> merely mentioning Ken—the pining and overlooked doll played by Ryan Gosling—would cause a failure of some sort. Gerwig agreed. “The world was like, <em>I don&#39;t care</em> ,” she joked.<br><br> But the world cares very much about the movie he&#39;s in. Since hitting theaters Friday, <em>Barbie</em> has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/24/1189760422/barbie-oppenheimer-box-office-ticket-sales">outperformed expectations</a> , becoming the first studio comedy to gross more than $100 million in its first weekend, as well as scoring the highest opening in North America ever for a female director. Audiences—many of whom dressed up in head-to-toe pink—packed theaters, even reportedly causing one to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/23/movies/barbie-oppenheimer-box-office-numbers.html">run out of concessions</a> by Saturday evening.<br><br> <em>Barbie</em> ’s massive debut makes the film Gerwig&#39;s biggest box-office success as a director to date. Yet the movie fits cleanly into Gerwig&#39;s oeuvre: Like 2017&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/lady-bird-greta-gerwig-review/544721/"><em>Lady Bird</em></a> and 2019&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/"><em>Little Women</em></a> , it intimately considers how femininity is expressed. <em>Barbie</em> , which Gerwig wrote with her partner, Noah Baumbach, can be unexpectedly weighty. Underneath the sparkly costumes and blowout parties is a lovely, humanist story that studies how products both influence and reflect who we are.<br><br> Maybe that sounds lofty, but consider Barbie (Margot Robbie) and Ken&#39;s adventure in the real world, which in the film is more than just an opportunity for fish-out-of-water hijinks. The pair take on the difficult task of navigating a society that treats men and women differently: Barbie wrestles with her flawed purpose as a toy meant to represent the ideal woman; Ken, created solely to be Barbie&#39;s arm candy, gets his first taste of power by observing humans, and misunderstands what he sees. <em>Barbie</em> is playful and thoughtful at once, a joke-fueled, often surreal spectacle wrapped around an earnest, feminist, and thoroughly Gerwig-ian core.<br><br> When we spoke on Friday morning, though, Gerwig had no idea how <em>Barbie</em> would land. She anticipated being, as she put it, “anxious all day,” and was eager to chat instead of worrying about the movie&#39;s reception. We spoke about the thematic through line of her films, as well as what her time in Barbie Land taught her. (And don&#39;t worry, Ken fans. We got to him eventually.)<br><br> <em>This conversation has been edited for length and clarity.</em><br><br> <strong>Shirley Li:</strong> There are big ideas in this <em>Barbie</em> movie about self-worth and how what we consume—or play with, in the case of dolls—affects who we become. I noticed a little girl at my screening asking lots of questions during the film; she seemed a bit confused by the headier themes but was having a good time, especially when the dolls sang and danced. So I&#39;m curious: When you and Noah were writing the film, who did you picture as your viewer?<br><br> <strong>Greta Gerwig:</strong> I don&#39;t really have a strong sense of, <em>Here&#39;s stuff for kids; here&#39;s stuff for adults</em> . I know there&#39;s stuff that is more heady, but when I look back at my viewing experiences as a kid, it was often the things that were just beyond me that were the most compelling, because they felt like a little window into a world that I was emerging into.<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> Like what?<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> This is a very strange, very specific memory, but when I was 5, my dad was working in New York, and my mom and I got rush tickets to <em>Gypsy</em> . I didn&#39;t understand most of it, but when Gypsy is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wErVF7QwIY&amp;ab_channel=ProjectUnleash">performing in a burlesque club</a> , there are these strippers wearing old-timey stripper outfits with sparkles, and I loved it. I didn&#39;t understand half of what had gone on, but we got one of those big commemorative books, and I remember just studying the pages where all the strippers were, because I thought they were <em>so</em> beautiful. I didn&#39;t have any sense of them being objectified. I just loved that they wore these beautiful, glittery outfits and big headdresses. There&#39;s probably a ton of memories I have like that.<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> <em>Lady Bird</em> is based on your own experiences, <em>Little Women</em> is a book you loved growing up, and you played with Barbies when you were young. Has using your films to revisit the touchstones of childhood been an intentional choice for you?<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> Honestly, it&#39;s something that&#39;s been somewhat hidden from me in the making of them, because on the surface they look so different. But now that I&#39;m through this one, I can see that they&#39;re all circling this idea. [ <em>Laughs.</em> ] You&#39;re interested in what you&#39;re interested in, and I&#39;m interested in women. But I also think—and this sounds kind of silly—one of my obsessions, as it were, is that I truly kind of can&#39;t believe that we live in linear time. [ <em>Laughs.</em> ] It&#39;s a shocker. Obviously, when you have a kid, you&#39;re extremely connected to that, but you can be connected to it within your life as well.<br><br> And I think that in trying to pull it together and understand where you are and where you&#39;ve been, there&#39;s always an <em>ache</em> in it. Clearly that was the way in which I approached adapting <em>Little Women</em> , because I <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/">saw the characters as adults</a> , suddenly, in a way that I had never seen them when I was young. And with <em>Lady Bird</em> , it&#39;s a story with a high-school student, and there are certain things that you feel it&#39;s important to hit, like the prom, but actually it&#39;s about your mother, and your <em>leaving</em> . It&#39;s something I return to because cinema is inherently a time capsule anyway, so it already deals in time. It&#39;s what I&#39;m intellectually and artistically interested in, and the medium itself seems to have that already embedded in it.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/">Read: Greta Gerwig&#39;s <em>Little Women</em> finally gives Amy her due</a><br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> Maybe the better way to put it is: Your films are kind of all about how girls learn to be women.<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> Oh, <em>yeah</em> !<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> Have I oversimplified?<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> No, I love it! That&#39;s beautiful. [ <em>Laughs.</em> ] Maybe that&#39;s the thing you do forever, though. I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s, like, a place you arrive to. It&#39;s certainly not related to an age, because it&#39;s forever unfolding.<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> In that case, what preoccupies you about girlhood that making these movies is perhaps helping you understand?<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> Well, taking it apart is difficult, but so much of it for me has to do with intergenerational conversations. When I think of my grandmother to my mother to me, life for women has just transformed so, so much, and I don&#39;t know where it&#39;s transforming next, but we keep learning from each other. I&#39;m going to be 40 in a week, and I&#39;m starting to feel, in a wonderful way, like I belong to the generation that young women will look back on, and that feels wonderful and strange. I do think it&#39;s a way for me to be in the conversation in a deep way that feels worth having, whether it&#39;s womanhood or personhood or existing in linear time. [ <em>Laughs.</em> ] Linear time is a real hang-up I have.<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> You&#39;ve said that making this film felt as personal as anything else you&#39;ve made. Is there a scene that comes to mind that you feel really evokes how personal this film is for you?<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> It&#39;s everything from the font for the <em>Barbie</em> logo—I kept being drawn to the bubble-letter version because in part that was the one I saw at Toys “R” Us—down to the fact that Kate McKinnon&#39;s character was very much a reflection of the Barbies that I had, a doll that&#39;s been loved and is no longer in a state of pristine perfection in the box. And the woman Barbie sees on the bench is a friend of mine, the brilliant costume designer Ann Roth. I just kept thinking of faces, and when you look at her face, I think you see something that feels like a life lived, and that age is not just valuable in its duration.<br><br> And [when Barbie and her creator hold hands], all those video clips were taken from everyone who worked on the movie—women, mothers, sisters, daughters, friends. I&#39;m a big believer in, like, even if you don&#39;t literally know things in a movie, I think you can kind of feel them. I&#39;ve always loved the fact that in <em>Goodfellas</em> , Martin Scorsese&#39;s mother plays the mom. You don&#39;t know that that&#39;s his mom, but you feel that she&#39;s exactly that person somehow, and it feels personal. In a way, it&#39;s not dissimilar to being a child watching a movie and not understanding every reference, but somehow <em>feeling</em> it. The personal embedded in it is part of what people unconsciously glean.<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> Speaking of those video clips, let&#39;s talk more about the ending. Can you tell me about the decision to have the Barbies and Kens reach, not a definitive solution, but kind of a détente? President Barbie, played by Issa Rae, does not allow Ken a seat on the Supreme Court. They&#39;re still figuring things out.<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> We&#39;re <em>all</em> still figuring things out—that&#39;s part of it. But the only thing I could ever give anyone is that they&#39;re all still in the mess. Maybe it&#39;s a little better for the Kens. You don&#39;t want to tell people how to watch things, but at the end of the movie, the production design incorporates some of Ken&#39;s fascinations into Barbie Land. Like, the perfection is not as beautiful as the thing that started blending everything together. I remember when we went to shoot the finale, when we all walked on set, we were like, <em>This is the most beautiful it&#39;s ever been</em> .<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> Can you walk me through why Ken rejects the patriarchy in the end? It&#39;s interesting that he admits he didn&#39;t understand it.<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> [ <em>Silence</em> ]<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> Oh, no. Greta, did I lose you? Hello?<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> Hi, okay, I don&#39;t know what happened. It just went away.<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> It&#39;s okay. I think it&#39;s kind of funny that a question about Ken led to you dropping off the call.<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> [ <em>Laughs.</em> ] The world was like, “I don&#39;t care.”<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> Yeah, “Let&#39;s move on.” So I was asking: Where did the idea that Ken doesn&#39;t actually want to take over Barbie Land come from? The film is careful to paint him not as a vindictive antagonist, but as a misguided one.<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> Well, in a way, you do things unconsciously and then sort of piece it together later, but there was an element where it felt like at the end, you want to be rescued from yourself. I guess the dark dystopian version of it is <em>Lord of the Flies</em> , like, children gone wild. They&#39;re dolls, but they&#39;re also sort of psychologically children.<br><br> I think about my stepson, actually. When he was younger, he just didn&#39;t go to bed. So one time, I walked into his bedroom, and he was standing on his bed throwing his stuffed animals around, and he screamed, “I wish someone would make me stop!” It was so pure [ <em>laughs</em> ], like, actually, he is right! He wished someone would make him stop. And when Ryan Gosling and I talked about how he would perform the ending, I talked a lot about my 4-year-old son. If he&#39;s crying, and you say, “Harold, are you upset we had to leave the park?” He&#39;ll say, “Ye-ea-aah, ye-ee-aah.” Like, he&#39;s acknowledging [his sadness], but even just doing that is so <em>hard</em> , that quality of emotion.<br><br> Obviously, these systems are terrible for men too. When <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">America was giving her beautiful speech</a> , I was just sobbing, and then I looked around, and I realized everybody&#39;s crying on the set. The men are crying too, because they have their own speech they feel they can&#39;t ever give, you know? And they have their twin tightrope, which is also painful. There&#39;s something about some of these structures that is just, you know, “Somebody make me stop!” That&#39;s sort of, I suppose, the feeling behind Ken.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">Read: The surprising key to understanding the <em>Barbie</em> film</a><br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> This is such a massive movie, and it&#39;s a high-pressure moment in your career. You hold a lot of power as a filmmaker now, and I have to ask, what do you intend to do with it?<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> [ <em>Laughs.</em> ] <em>What do I intend?</em> Being a filmmaker is an amazing thing, because movies are hard, and you&#39;ll never really get on top of the mountain. Because whatever you&#39;re making next, you haven&#39;t made—so then you&#39;re going to learn what you don&#39;t know about <em>this</em> movie, you know? It&#39;s difficult, and that&#39;s part of the appeal. But then, also, you&#39;re only going to make a movie, if you&#39;re lucky, once every two, three, four years. So if you start doing the math of a life, you realize, <em>What am I going to do, make 15 movies?</em> You know, not too many. But if I&#39;m lucky, I can get to a life that will feel as meaningful as anything I could hope to do. I <em>do</em> want to make movies in my 60s and my 70s, and God willing, maybe I&#39;ll make some extremely strange ones in my 80s.<br><br> <strong>Li:</strong> Now that you&#39;ve done the big-budget studio tentpole, how do you envision your storytelling evolving? I imagine that you haven&#39;t always been doing the math of a life.<br><br> <strong>Gerwig:</strong> I want to be able to make movies at all scales. I like having the skill set to make something tiny, and I like having the skills to paint with the biggest brushes. It&#39;s always about what&#39;s going to give you the most freedom creatively, and that can mean different things.<br><br> I feel extraordinarily lucky also to have been able to grow into something bigger. I co-wrote, I co-directed, I acted in a lot of things in my 20s, and I kind of used that to get to take on directing. <em>Little Women</em> was an intermediate step, and when I think about young filmmakers, depending on what you want to do, those mid-level movies are just incredible to make if you&#39;re interested in seeing how it can expand or contract. I feel very grateful that I got to do that, because I couldn&#39;t have done <em>this</em> without that.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 18:24:05 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-greta-gerwig-interview/674817/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-greta-gerwig-interview/674817/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel on the Brink]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Netanyahu&#39;s judicial overhaul mistakes majoritarianism for democracy. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/RGHxrBps3EEQwTrfHvfpjqPB85Y=/0x358:6892x4235/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_1542045159/original.jpg" alt="An Israeli military reservist waves a national flag as he drops in a box a signed declaration announcing the suspension of his voluntary reserve duty, in protest of the government's judicial-overhaul bill, in Tel Aviv." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Menahem Kahana / AFP / Getty</figcaption></figure> The Knesset&#39;s passage of legislation yesterday to curtail the authority of Israel&#39;s Supreme Court marks a new era for the state of Israel. The disjuncture comes not because of the legal implications alone, although they are substantial. Nor because of the economic, diplomatic, and security damage wrought in the short time since Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu returned to office, although it is considerable. Rather, the new era begins because of the damage that proceeding with the bill has done to Israeli society itself.<br><br> In March, the governing coalition led by Netanyahu paused in its effort to overhaul judicial review. Instead, it turned to administrative review—the Court&#39;s authority to overturn actions taken by the executive branch—limiting the ability of the Court to set aside acts it deems “unreasonable.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/benjamin-netanyahu-coalition-israel-democracy/672693/">Yossi Klein Halevi: Netanyahu&#39;s betrayal of a democracy is a betrayal of Israel</a><br><br> The reasonableness doctrine, as Amichai Cohen and Yuval Shani of the Israel Democracy Institute explained in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-end-of-reasonable-governance-in-israel"><em>Lawfare</em></a> , provided grounds for striking down a decision where the Court found a conflict of interest, a procedural impropriety, or an act that exceeded the government&#39;s legal authority. The Court could also rule on substantive grounds, finding that the government had acted in a discriminatory manner, taken into account irrelevant considerations, or adopted “patently unreasonable” decisions.<br><br> Both judicial and administrative review are powers broadly shared by courts in most democracies, but the reasonableness doctrine can be interpreted expansively. Many in Israel&#39;s political opposition would have been open to a good-faith, consensus-based approach to constitutional reform, including the reasonableness doctrine. But that does not describe the Netanyahu coalition&#39;s effort. The legislation passed yesterday was openly touted as just the first element in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israels-majoritarian-nightmare-should-be-a-us-concern/">a sweeping plan</a> to curtail nearly all checks on government power in Israel, which is already expansive.<br><br> Netanyahu, usually a cautious leader, has done more to fracture Israeli society in seven months than any prime minister before him, widening and exposing the deep gulf between his supporters and his opponents. The result has been an unprecedented political drama playing out in Israeli streets, as leaders of business and industry, academia, the medical establishment, labor unions, etc. protest his agenda.<br><br> Most notably, large numbers of military reservists have announced their intention to stop volunteering—which is not the same as refusing orders to serve, something no one has suggested. The volunteers include hundreds of servicemen in the air force, which relies on the reserves. As my Brookings Institution colleague Amos Harel wrote in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-24/ty-article/.premium/prime-minister-netanyahu-is-out-of-touch-with-israels-protesters-and-reservists/00000189-84de-d95c-a7ab-fdffc76a0000"><em>Haaretz</em></a> , the potential damage to military readiness is serious, and the Lebanese Hezbollah, among others, sees an opportunity.<br><br> Although there is no threat of the military disobeying civilian orders, or even a call for it to do so, individual military service has long been seen as an apolitical act in a country with ostensibly universal conscription, and a military with widely diverse political opinions. The government&#39;s supporters view the protest of the reservists as a betrayal of the common Israeli code; its opponents view it as a sign that the Netanyahu government is tearing apart that code. Refusing to defend the state is a doomsday weapon, but a large segment of Israeli society believes it faces a democratic doomsday.<br><br> Ironically, the best explanation of the current situation came from Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right minister of finance and member of the security cabinet. Back in March, in response to a terrorist attack against an Israeli settlement, violent youth from those settlements rampaged through the Palestinian town of Huwara—an outburst that the Israeli general in charge called a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/15/middleeast/huwara-west-bank-settler-attack-cmd-intl/index.html">pogrom</a> . Smotrich <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-should-wipe-out-palestinian-town-of-huwara-says-senior-minister-smotrich/">condemned</a> the vigilante violence in an interview, but said that the Palestinian town should be “wiped out” by the state instead.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/02/israel-palestine-west-bank-illegal-settlement-netanyahu/672944/">Read: From this hill, you can see the next Intifada</a><br><br> During the ensuing uproar, Smotrich was approached by a friend, an Israeli-air-force pilot, who, Smotrich said, enlightened him about the damage his words had done. In an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-733756">apology</a> of sorts, Smotrich expressed his shock that he had been understood to have meant precisely what he indeed said. He did, however, spell out what had horrified so many in the military. Once a fringe far-right activist, Smotrich had become a senior cabinet minister, in a country where the cabinet is the collective commander in chief of the military. Pilots and others in the military are handed immense firepower, Smotrich&#39;s friend explained, and they rely on the political leadership and state institutions to issue only morally defensible orders. Given the extreme positions taken by members of the Netanyahu cabinet, and its energetic efforts to limit all checks on its authority, military personnel were left to guess whether a senior cabinet minister was actually planning to order them to commit a war crime. That situation, for many, became untenable.<br><br> More broadly, many in Israel sense a breakdown of the social contract. If Israel is not fully democratic, then the state—which holds together a remarkably <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tribes-identity-and-individual-freedom-in-israel/">diverse</a> Jewish population—can come undone. For Israel&#39;s Arab citizens, the struggle to find their place in Israeli society has been all the more difficult, but their economic, social, and political gains in recent years are also threatened as judicial limits to the rule of a political majority that usually excludes them are removed.<br><br> Netanyahu supporters also sense a crisis. They see the breadth and strength of the protests against the reforms, and the refusal of reservists to volunteer, as efforts to subvert majority rule. They won the last election, they feel, and now the opposition is using extra-electoral means to prevent their preferred policies from being enacted. At their own protests, they have embraced the slogan “Second-class citizen,” a complaint that their votes count for less and their electoral mandates are regarded as illegitimate. Netanyahu supporters, on average, come from lower socioeconomic strata of society, and feel that established elites are fighting to retain their hold on the country in the face of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqulftg2">demographic</a> trends that favor Netanyahu&#39;s coalition.<br><br> Ignoring the views of the large <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://en.idi.org.il/articles/47968">minority</a> that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-752172">supports</a> the government would be a mistake, yet there are two major flaws in its narrative. The first is that Netanyahu&#39;s government is not just pursuing a set of controversial policies but seeking to implement constitutional change. Securing a slender majority in an election should not suffice to make sweeping changes to a country&#39;s constitution. Israeli law grants a small or temporary majority the same constitutional power as a broad coalition, and allows swift constitutional changes, but it should still seek consensus and exercise self-restraint, not just as a matter of fairness but to safeguard the integrity of the polity.<br><br> Second, Netanyahu and many of his supporters have confused majoritarianism with democracy. These are not the same thing. As I <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israels-majoritarian-nightmare-should-be-a-us-concern/">wrote</a> in February, democracy is the rule of the people, the <em>demos</em> , all of it, including the minority. Democracy is not a license for the majority to do as it wishes, with no guardrails.<br><br> Netanyahu supporters often claim that they have no tyrannical intentions. In private and in public, they greet any suggestion that they might abuse human or civil rights <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/3256199581377447/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%2252%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22%5b%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22share_link%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22share_link%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A%7B%5C%22invite_link_id%5C%22%3A511218184399898%7D%7D%5d%22%7D">indignantly</a> . Israel, however, also happens to control much of the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank, for whom this argument rings hollow. They have seen otherwise. And although the current checks on executive action have had only a limited effect within the West Bank, there is a reason the ideological elements of the settler movement are so keen on the judicial overhaul. Without any checks, things could be far worse.<br><br> Moreover, good intentions are not enough in constitutional arrangements. Institutions, constraints, and the rule of law are also essential. Israel doesn&#39;t need good intentions; it requires the messiness of real democracy.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 18:11:13 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-limit-supreme-court-power-protests/674819/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-limit-supreme-court-power-protests/674819/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Oppenheimer’s Cry of Despair in The Atlantic]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>在美国与苏联军备竞赛开始之际，这位伟大的科学家所能做的就是祈求希望。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/AjNA1aT674UuHHRmJHHbtxriWlM=/0x0:3596x2023/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/opp_atlwriter/original.jpg" alt="J·罗伯特·奥本海默抽烟" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>环球图片/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>1949 年 2 月，曼哈顿计划洛斯阿拉莫斯实验室前主任 J. 罗伯特·奥本海默 (J.

20 世纪 40 年代后半叶，他关于科学问题的言论具有非凡的严肃性。 “当然，他对原子能潜力的了解与任何活着的美国人一样多，”他在<em>《大西洋月刊》</em>上发表的文章顶部的编辑注释中写道。<br><br>他用这个巨大的声音做了什么？ He opposed the development of a much more powerful, second-generation atomic weapon—the hydrogen bomb, which Edward Teller called the “super”—in part because he was concerned it would accelerate an arms race with the Soviet Union.他还利用自己的声望和信誉来持续努力避免军备竞赛。他帮助起草了后来演变为“巴鲁克计划”的提案，这是美国向联合国提交的一项军备控制制度。在后者的指导下，所有国家都将放弃其原子武器计划，原子能将成为全球集体财产，由联合国的中央监管机构管理，任何国家都没有否决权。<br><br> <a

。他的文章是一件令人着迷的历史文物，也是公众悲痛的表现。它的标题是“开放的思想”，阐述了奥本海默对军备控制提案反复讨论的描述。苏联领导人投了反对票，但他们的反应并非完全否定。他们一致认为，所有国​​家都应废除其原子武器计划，原子能应接受国际监督。但他们反对美国坚持在新系统投入运行之前继续其武器计划，这也许是可以理解的。他们希望哈里·杜鲁门总统首先解除武装，但他无法遵守这个条件。<br><br>在曼哈顿计划期间，奥本海默的远见能力让他失望了。无论他对原子内部结构的计算多么准确，他都错误地判断了在他和他的同事将原子内部结构分解后会发生的地缘政治后果。出于天真，或者野心的权宜盲目性，或者两者的某种结合，他可能相信在纳粹被击败后他可以停止进一步使用原子弹，或者原子弹的可怕景象最终会导致放弃更大规模的武器和战争。<br><br>

wrote.这一次，影响是显而易见的，而且牵涉到美国，正如奥本海默哀叹的那样，美国“采取了一些我们原本希望可能会被普遍放弃的措施作为回应”。原子弹的大规模制造正在进行，美国科学家接到明确的命令，将新物理学用于更具破坏性的武器。<br><br>奥本海默看到一场惨淡的军备竞赛正在形成，这一次他的预见被证明是准确的。几个月之内，苏联成功测试了第一颗原子弹，仅仅三年后，即 1952 年，美国引爆了一枚氢弹，其威力大约是摧毁长崎的那颗氢弹的 500 倍。几年后，苏联也效仿了这一做法，到 1967 年奥本海默去世时，两国已拥有近 4 万枚核武器，其中许多都是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">一触即发的</a>。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">阅读：永远不要给人工智能核密码</a><br><br>奥本海默知道他帮助创造了这个世界。他试图让我们的读者为它的恐怖做好准备。总的来说，他的建议是不要失去希望，并记住我们对未来的想象力是有限的。奥本海默也许对充满不确定性的量子世界感到振奋，这在他年轻时就让他着迷。他似乎从这样一种信念中汲取了力量，即人类事务的宏观世界同样是偶然的，因此我们的命运没有任何事情是注定的。<br><br>奥本海默引用了亚伯拉罕·林肯在内战三年后在巴尔的摩发表的演讲。林肯说，在那场冲突开始时，很少有人预料到“家庭奴隶制会受到很大影响”，但事实确实如此。现实是不可预测的；它会让你大吃一惊。林肯提醒奥本海默，惊喜是双向的。一个看似堕落的世界有时可能会走向道德进步。<br><br>我们以前见过这样的转变，甚至在核领域也是如此。到了 20 世纪 80 年代，巨大的核武器库似乎已成为地球上的一个事实。 1986年，苏联的弹头库存达到历史最高水平，约为4万枚，美国则超过2万枚。很少有人想到冷战即将结束。许多人也没有想到，乔治·H·W·布什和米哈伊尔·戈尔巴乔夫将在 1991 年签署《削减战略武器条约》，这是一系列非同寻常的协议中的第一项，这些协议将两国的武库规模削减到了之前规模的四分之一以下。<br><br>布什和戈尔巴乔夫明智地抓住了这一天，因为那个时代的和平及其干净的两党战略对称性被证明是短暂的。此后，核毁灭的幽灵强势回归全球集体心理。弗拉基米尔·普京在有关<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://Read:%20What%20if%20Russia%20uses%20nuclear%20weapons%20in%20Ukraine?">入侵乌克兰的</a>演讲中援引了这一点。中国已经建立了一个足以摧毁美国所有主要城市的武库。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/russia-ukraine-nuclear-weapon-us-response/661315/">阅读：如果俄罗斯在乌克兰使用核武器怎么办？</a><br><br>正如奥本海默深知的那样，从<em>技术</em>上讲，威胁世界的核武器库存不会在我们身边存在数十万年。在任何小型交易所都很容易成为大型交易所的战略环境中，要让大量交易所长期存在，就是在玩傻瓜游戏。没有人应该感到安全，因为七十年过去了，没有再发生核战争事件；样本量太小。<br><br>除了提出希望之外，奥本海默并没有就如何拆除他帮助悬挂在人类文明之上的达摩克利斯之剑提供太多指导。作为一个臭名昭著的花花公子和雄辩的即兴演说家，他总是被风格所吸引。在他的<em>《大西洋月刊》</em>文章中，他以更高的形式引用了这一点。他写道：“在外交政策领域，风格使我们能够在追求对我们至关重要的目标与尊重那些可能从另一个角度看待问题的人的观点、情感和愿望之间找到和谐。”<br><br>奥本海默想到的问题是军备控制。他要求那些代表美国进行谈判的人本着开放的精神开展工作。他要求它们能够吸引坐在桌子对面的人的理性思维。他似乎相信——或者想要相信——这种风格的广泛采用可能足以启动地缘政治新的进化步骤，通过这一步骤，世界主要大国可能会达成共识，即和平是最高智慧。为此，他建议保持耐心。他指出，必须让时间和自然发挥作用。七十年过去了，这看起来确实是一项缓慢的工作。<br><br></div>

上方" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>本·科特/大西洋月刊</figcaption></figure>五月份，埃隆·马斯克主持对 Twitter 主页进行了一次不同寻常的微妙调整。多年来，页面顶部文本框中的提示都是“发生了什么？”，这是友好地邀请用户分享他们的想法。这位亿万富翁接管八个月后，Twitter 稍微<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/05/12/heres-how-twitters-appearance-has-changed-under-elon-musk/?sh=76231c985f68">改变了</a>提示，以适应新政权下该平台令人费解、混乱的本质：“发生了什么事？”变成了“发生了什么事？！”<br><br>这个问题的紧迫性与过去 48 小时相比，与 Twitter 的关系最为密切，当时马斯克决定废除 17 年的品牌知名度并重新命名。这位以前被称为 Twitter 的艺术家现在是 X。<em>发生了什么事？！</em>的确。<br><br>除了简单的“没什么”之外，我对这个问题有三个答案。 （即使有了新名称，该网站也几乎和以前一样；网站左上角的蓝鸟标志现在是一个黑色的<em>X</em> ，而且……就是这样。）这个 X 可能只是一个不想拥有自己的社交网络并通过诉讼迫使其购买它的人的胡言乱语，但马斯克和 Twitter（X？）首席执行官琳达·亚卡里诺（Linda Yaccarino）希望你相信更大的事情即将到来。<br><br> <strong>1.马斯克想要建立“埃隆互联网”。</strong><br><br>第一个理论要求认真对待马斯克的野心。在去年 10 月的一条推文中，他 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633">宣称</a>“购买 Twitter 是创建 X 这个一切应用程序的加速剂。”这些“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/18/23687125/elon-musk-twitter-x-super-app-wechat">超级应用程序</a>”的版本已经存在，并且在亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲很受欢迎，所以我们知道这意味着什么：X 将作为一个整体平台发挥作用，包括支付处理和银行、拼车、新闻、与朋友的交流以及大量的商务。把它想象成互联网，但不要离开马斯克的围墙花园。在 2022 年 6 月 Twitter 市政厅<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23171541/leaked-transcript-elon-musk-first-meeting-twitter-employees">泄露的</a>录音中，马斯克暗示中国的微信是 X 的某种模型。“中国以外没有微信运动，”他说。 “我认为这是一个真正的机会来创造这一点。在中国，你基本上都生活在微信上，因为它对你的日常生活非常有用，非常有帮助。我认为，如果我们能够实现这一目标，甚至通过 Twitter 接近这一目标，那将是巨大的成功。”<br><br>如果你眯起眼睛，你就能看出其中的逻辑。 Twitter 上的很多人——影响者、自由职业者、小企业主——都使用这个平台来销售东西。其中许多人使用各种“个人简介中的链接”页面来引导人们进行工作并接收付款。 X，理论上的一切应用程序，可以简化和整合这些交流，并且像微信一样，从中 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/">产生收入</a>。马斯克已经启动了一项计划，与 Twitter 的一些较大的“创建者”帐户分享广告收入，该计划的早期受益者<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/twitter-creators-payments-right-wing/">包括</a>许多著名的右翼冲击运动员。如果他能够设法让数亿人在他的应用程序上生活、购物和银行，而不是发表垃圾言论并与白人民族主义者争论政治，那将是一个巨大的成功。<br><br>为此，X 需要构建一个先进、安全的支付平台；申请适当的监管许可来合法处理付款和储存资金；当然，还要招募企业和金融机构使用该平台。据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/9d84d534-b2dd-4cff-85d1-aee137b26a45"><em>英国《金融时报》报道</em></a>，该公司于今年年初开始提交这些许可证的申请，并一直在建设部分支付基础设施。坏消息是，马斯克负责牵头该项目的人被解雇了，Twitter 约<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html">80%</a>的员工也被解雇了。<br><br> <a

X.com），不久后与 Confinity 合并，成为 PayPal。如果不是马斯克在过去 15 个月里在众目睽睽之下在他最新的商业冒险中犯了错误，也许这会给他的超级应用想法带来一些可信度。他以其反动和阴谋性的政治观点疏远了广告商，使公司深陷债务，有时还通过限制用户可以看到的推文数量而<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-outage-elon-musk-user-restrictions/674609/">导致该平台无法使用</a>。根据<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1678065025750294532?s=20">流量数据</a>，该平台在马斯克的领导下似乎正在萎缩。垃圾邮件<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/09/technology/elon-musk-twitter-spam-bots.html">猖獗</a>，最满意的用户似乎是以前被禁止的种族主义者和反犹太主义者，他们重新获得了扩音器的使用权。<br><br>对于马斯克来说，要让人们相信他的溅射平台是发布<em>巴本</em>海默模因的最佳场所已经很困难了，更不用说是……一切事物的正确归宿，包括我们的钱。但当你考虑解释 X 的第二种方式时，马斯克的声誉失血和他的宏伟野心之间的认知失调就更容易弥合了，即这是一次在黑暗中孤注一掷的尝试。<br><br> <strong>2. X 是<em>伪软件</em>——只是流行语和徽标。</strong><br><br>与 Facebook <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg/620538/">转向 Meta</a>的方向不同，Meta 是围绕一个真实的（尽管有缺陷且没有吸引力的）虚拟现实产品，X 是一个品牌重塑，只不过是一些模糊的流行语集合，拼凑在一起形成一个完整的句子。周日，亚卡里诺将即将推出的应用程序<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213895463215104?s=20">描述</a>为“无限互动的未来状态”，“以音频、视频、消息、支付/银行业务为中心——为创意、商品、服务和机会创建一个全球市场。”她还指出，“在人工智能的支持下，X 将以我们刚刚开始想象的方式连接我们所有人。” （亚卡里诺没有回应置评请求。）<br><br>她的推文是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/630ec150bcbd490021b17eab/business-dudes-need-to-stop-talking-like-this/">商业人士<em>lorem ipsum</em></a>的近乎完美的例子——公司的胡言乱语，表面上听起来很聪明，但实际上却令人困惑。什么是“无限互动”？ X将如何“由AI驱动”？她指的是像 ChatGPT 这样的生成式人工智能，还是多年来为 Twitter 的“For you”提要提供支持的标准算法？细节无关紧要：这些词串在一起时听起来像<em>什么</em>就可以了。<br><br>马斯克也犯过这样的胡言乱语。他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1683324036950966273?s=20">认为</a>，他的假设项目如果构建正确，可能“成为全球金融体系的一半”。这是业余爱好者的空洞语言，相当于我告诉你这篇文章如果写得正确，有望赢得普利策解释性新闻奖，或者我是<em>《大西洋月刊</em>》关于计算机的文字部分的执行文字大师。<br><br>马斯克和亚卡里诺对 X 的描述不仅仅意味着<em>“汽件”（vaporware）</em> ，这是一个行业术语，指的是一种从未实现的大肆宣传的产品。它们也感觉像是别的东西：我称之为<em>伪软件</em>。与<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/6258e039dc551a00208cc5e1/elon-musk-meme-stocks-and-retail-investing-for-the-superrich/">伪事件</a>一样，伪软件伪装成具有新闻价值的事物，尽管事实并非如此。亚卡里诺的 Mad Libs-ian 推文风暴是这个伪事件的新闻稿：迄今为止已在装饰性变化中体现出来的支点的大讨论。马斯克的首要任务是采用新标志并将其<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1683541303680987136?s=20">投影</a>在总部的会议室中。当 Yaccarino 发推文说“X 将以我们刚刚开始想象的方式将我们所有人联系起来”时，我相信她的话：似乎没有人花太多时间思考这一切。<br><br>人们很自然地想知道为什么世界上最富有的人会花时间拆除世界上最知名的社交媒体品牌之一，转而支持一个无人问津的神秘超级应用程序。他可以随时飞往私人岛屿，一边喝着无限量的冰镇果汁朗姆酒，一边咯咯地谈论狗狗币！这里有对X的第三个也是最重要的解释，那就是它是马斯克的声誉信用额度。<br><br> <strong>3.马斯克需要挽回面子。</strong><br><br>马斯克的声誉取决于人们相信他能够开辟新的工业类别，并能看到周围的角落，创造出未来的东西。他斥资 440 亿美元收购 Twitter 时提出了一个富有远见的框架：马斯克将实现 Twitter 成为真正的全球城镇广场的梦想，并大规模解决言论自由的棘手问题。在这方面失败后，马斯克本质上是在 X 回归基础——这是一个按照他自己的形象重塑互联网的机会。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-outage-elon-musk-user-restrictions/674609/">阅读：埃隆·马斯克这次真的打破了推特</a><br><br>正如<em>彭博社</em>的 Max Chafkin <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/chafkin/status/1683475959981264900/photo/2">指出的</a>那样，马斯克最初的 X.com 品牌彻底失败了。他对这个名字和网址很着迷，但消费者将这个品牌与成人娱乐网站联系起来，这并非不合逻辑。 2000 年合并后，马斯克被 X.com 董事会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-elon-musk-fired-from-paypal/">驱逐</a>，一年后该服务更名为 PayPal，但这家支付公司仍然是他遗产的重要组成部分。那么，X 是对年轻版企业家的回想——他与成功、有效的产品和丰厚的投资者回报联系在一起。这也代表着未完成的事业以及重写他职业生涯早期阶段的机会。<br><br>从这个意义上说，X与其说是一个辉煌的愿景，不如说是一种绝望的行为。马斯克的行为很像一家烧钱速度不可持续的初创公司——他需要现金注入。为了筹集一些声誉资本，他需要一个好主意，一个看起来合理且可扩展的主意。 X 勾选了这个想法的所有方框。它的野心如此模糊以至于无边无际，这标志着永恒的增长和赚钱——毫不夸张地说，它是<em>一切</em>应用程序。这样，X对于任何仍然想相信马斯克的人来说都是一个墨迹测试：以正确的方式眯起眼睛，X就会呈现出该人对互联网未来的任何希望和梦想的形式。这就是伪软件的转瞬即逝的天才：营销一款应用程序的最大特点是，你几乎什么都不说就可以逃脱惩罚。<br><br>但到底有多少人仍然对马斯克抱有坚定的信心，这是一个悬而未决的问题。有多少人愿意对不能按时支付<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.platformer.news/p/twitter-stiffs-google">费用</a>的人进行无罪推定？谁将帮助这位解雇了公司大部分股权​​并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/12/twitter-severance-payments-lawsuit">据称</a>欠下 5 亿美元遣散费的人打造这家科技巨头？也许最重要的是，谁对马斯克将时间、精力和金钱集中在什么事情上感到兴奋？<br><br>尽管 X 想要做大，但与马斯克将自己推销为专家的项目相比，微信克隆在概念上还是很小的：太空探索、重新连接人类大脑、彻底改变交通以拯救地球。对X最愤世嫉俗的观点是，那些仍然尊重马斯克的人都是反动派，他们只有在敌人被兴高采烈地嘲笑时才感到高兴。那么，马斯克对社交网络的拆除也许是成功的，只要它让正确的人痛苦即可。由于别无选择，马斯克决定抵押 Twitter 品牌来拯救自己的品牌。即使按照他的标准，这也是一个冒险的赌注。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 16:56:12 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

英尺，腰部同步弯曲，然后像压碎的汽水罐一样塌陷。十秒钟之内，他们就倒塌成滚滚尘土。<br><br>对于任何观看过拆除过程或在网上观看过视频的人来说，这个信息很明确：TVA，一家规模庞大的联邦公用事业公司，成立于 90 年前，是富兰克林·D·罗斯福总统新政的一部分，正在摆脱煤炭。<br><br>尽管该地区的一些人对此举感到遗憾，但这对当地环境和全球气候来说是一场胜利。在过去的几年里，随着减缓气候变化的紧迫性日益增强，人们就如何做到这一点达成了共识：绿色电网，同时尽可能地重组经济体——汽车、建筑、工厂——以使用零碳电力运行。乔·拜登总统去年 8 月签署的《抑制通货膨胀法案》以 3700 亿美元的补贴支持该计划。在 2021 年的行政命令中，拜登指示联邦政府“以身作则，到 2035 年实现无碳污染的电力部门”，并到 2050 年实现净零经济。<br><br>鉴于这一战略，电力公司对我们的未来至关重要，尤其是美国最大的公共电力提供商 TVA。其领土几乎涵盖整个田纳西州；阿拉巴马州、密西西比州和肯塔基州的大片地区；以及其他三个州的一些情况。在美国最保守的地区之一，1000 万人从联邦机构获得电力，而该机构无需向股东负责，也无利润可赚。<br><br> “TVA 是一只疯狂的独角兽，它与众不同，”南方清洁能源联盟执行董事斯蒂芬·史密斯 (Stephen Smith) 告诉我。作为一个联邦机构，TVA 不仅负责促进清洁能源转型，还负责建设清洁能源转型，它的定位是提供一个国家模式，TVA 表示它正在这样做。<br><br>但这并不是史密斯和其他环保倡导者对 TVA 行为的描述。他们看到一家公用事业公司正在用燃气发电厂取代天堂和其他地方的燃煤发电厂，这将污染气候数十年。他们看到一家公用事业公司在尚不存在的小型核反应堆上投入了大量资金。他们表示，最重要的是，TVA 未能采用成熟的清洁能源技术，例如太阳能和风能以及能源效率措施。<br><br> “TVA 是一个活生生的实验室，可以成为推动清洁能源转型的巨大推动力的一部分，”史密斯说。他认为这不再是一个“为实现零碳而战备的机构”，而是成为“行政部门的一个障碍”。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental-stewardship/sustainability/carbon-report">自 2005 年以来，TVA 已将碳排放量减少了一半以上</a>，远远高于全国电力行业的平均水平，同时收费低于平均水平。它通过用天然气替代煤炭并启动大型新核反应堆来实现这一目标。但与大多数美国公用事业公司一样，TVA 没有计划在 2035 年实现拜登提出的净零电网目标；它的目标是到那时只减少 80% 的碳排放。 “我们渴望到 2050 年实现净零排放，如果可以的话，我们渴望走得更远、更快，”自 2019 年起担任 TVA 总裁兼首席执行官的 Jeff Lyash 在 11 月的该机构董事会会议上表示。但就现有技术而言，他认为这是不可能的。<br><br>实现净零排放的正确道路是什么？田纳西河流域是一场全国性辩论的一个富有启发性的缩影，其中解决气候变化的必要性与不仅要维持可靠的电力供应，还要大幅扩大电力供应以满足脱碳经济的需求的巨大实际挑战之间的矛盾。 “TVA 在引领清洁能源未来方面处于独特的地位，”Lyash 在 11 月表示。他和他的批评者在这一点上达成了一致。但至于那个未来何时到来、是什么样子，他们确实相差甚远。<br><br>时间<br><br><span class="smallcaps">VA 诞生</span>于另一场全球危机。 1933 年，当罗斯福和内布拉斯加州共和党参议员乔治·诺里斯说服国会建立田纳西州管理局时，美国正处于大萧条的最低谷，田纳西河谷是美国最贫困的地区之一，那里只有极少数的家庭通电。 TVA 改变了它。从阿拉巴马州马斯尔肖尔斯的威尔逊大坝开始，一系列水坝控制了田纳西河及其支流的洪水，并使整个山谷通电。水力发电厂仍以无碳方式生产该地区约 10% 的电力。<br><br>私人公用事业公司讨厌TVA，并强烈抱怨他们认为不公平的竞争。他们两次向最高法院质疑该机构的存在，但都失败了。直到 20 世纪 50 年代，德怀特·艾森豪威尔 (Dwight Eisenhower) 总统还想出售该机构，他认为该机构是“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/18/archives/eisenhower-points-to-the-t-v-a-as-creeping-socialism-example.html">社会主义蠕动</a>”的一个例子。该机构通过半独立于联邦政府而得以生存。 TVA 的董事会由总统任命，国会确认，但自 1959 年以来，TVA 的大部分运作都没有联邦拨款。它通过出售电力来支付自己的费用——不是直接向消费​​者（除了几十个工业和联邦财产），而是向 153 家市政或合作拥有的地方电力公司 (LPC) 出售电力，这些公司负责向人民分配电力。<br><br>从一开始，TVA 的战略就是让电力变得便宜且容易获得，以便人们可以用它来做一切事情。该机构取得了如此巨大的成功，以至于需求很快就超过了即使是完全筑坝的河流也无法满足的需求。 20世纪50年代，TVA开始依赖煤炭作为主要能源，最终建造了12座大型发电厂。在过去的十年里，它已经关闭了六家，但仍然留下了大量的有毒火山灰。 2008 年，田纳西州金斯顿燃煤电厂的堤坝破裂， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/coal-other-dark-side-toxic-ash?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1676993465551">超过 500 万立方码的灰烬</a>流入埃默里河和克林奇河。<br><br>环保主义者长期以来有理由不信任 TVA。上世纪 70 年代，当新成立的环境保护局开始监管空气污染时，TVA 进行了抵制。习惯于自己做出工程决策的它认为，为其煤堆投资洗涤器是没有意义的——毕竟，它即将用核反应堆取代其中的大部分。但该机构只完成了计划中的 17 座反应堆中的 7 座——电力需求的增长速度低于预期——如今，未完工的反应堆残骸散布在山谷各处。此次惨败使 TVA 陷入债务困境，债务总额仍接近 200 亿美元。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1962/04/the-rape-of-the-appalachians/658469/">From the April 1962 issue: Harry Caudill on TVA and the destruction of the Appalachian Mountains</a><br><br>尽管如此，TVA仍对其核舰队感到自豪。尽管佐治亚电力公司预计很快就会将一座新反应堆投入运行，但 TVA 是过去三十年来唯一一家做到这一点的美国公用事业公司。 1973 年，该公司开始在田纳西州瓦茨巴工厂建造两座反应堆；将它们封存多年；然后分别于 1996 年和 2016 年完成。2023 年上半年，它们和该机构的其他反应堆帮助该机构发电了近 60% 的千瓦时而不排放碳，明显高于全国平均水平。但史蒂芬·史密斯告诉我，它“摸索、失败、失败”，陷入了令人羡慕的境地。史密斯说，气候危机需要变革，而 TVA 已经放弃了提供这种变革的历史使命。<br><br>在<span class="smallcaps">查塔努加市中心</span>，直接负责向该山谷 1000 万居民供电的人员坐在 TVA 的系统运营中心。这是一间宽敞、安静、灯光昏暗的房间，一排排弯曲的工作站面向墙壁，墙上贴满了 TVA 庞大的传输网格的照明示意图。第一排操作员跟踪输电线路的物理状况和电压。它们背后的运营商根据需要从电网周围的数百台发电机“调度”电力，每分钟都匹配供应与需求。这项复杂的工作通过拥有大量“可调度”电力而得到简化，这些电力是煤炭、天然气、核能和水力发电厂提供的，至少在原则上是这样：电力可以在一天或一年中的任何时间提供。<br><br>在俯瞰控制室的会议室里，我见到了 TVA 副总裁兼负责传输和供电的高级副总裁 Greg Henrich 和 Aaron Melda。梅尔达帮助制定了该机构的脱碳战略，他抓起一支记号笔在挂图上勾勒出数字。该战略的核心内容是到 2035 年关闭 TVA 的最后五座燃煤电厂，这些电厂的运行时间均超过 50 年。“同期，我们将增加 10,000 兆瓦的太阳能发电量，”梅尔达说。为了在没有阳光的时候储存能量，TVA 还将增加 1,000 兆瓦的电池容量。<br><br>不过，在接下来的十年里，该机构的主要碳减排战略是建造更多的天然气发电厂——价值 7,000 兆瓦，大致相当于当前燃煤电厂的容量。当我去年秋天参观系统运营中心时，TVA 正在敲定最新扩建项目的计划：位于田纳西州坎伯兰市的一座 1,450 兆瓦天然气发电厂，位于田纳西州坎伯兰市最大的燃煤发电厂所在地，该发电厂的两台发电机组计划于 2026 年和 2028 年退役。环保人士强烈反对这座天然气发电厂，甚至连 EPA 也对此提出质疑，认为这将使 TVA 在 2035 年甚至 2050 年之后很久才排放碳。不过，在短期内，改用煤炭将大幅减少碳和其他污染物的排放。 “用天然气代替煤炭，现在每一兆瓦的碳强度都降低了 50%，”梅尔达说。<br><br> Why not just build more batteries and more solar, and take the intensity down to zero? It would cost a lot more, Melda said, and batteries discharge within several hours. A few rainy days could leave you unable to meet demand. Nor is solar a big help on dark winter mornings, which are the moments that TVA worries about most. The majority of homes in the Valley have electric heat. A spokesperson for TVA, Scott Fiedler, later said that gas is “the only mature technology that allows us to quickly add renewable energy and maintain the low cost and reliability” needed.<br><br> I visited the system-ops center on a chilly November day a week before Thanksgiving. Early that morning, as people cranked up their thermostat, TVA had seen a fairly typical winter peak in the load on its grid. Warmer weather was coming that would drive down demand, Henrich said, but it would rise again on Thanksgiving morning, as people roasted turkeys. That afternoon, the load would plummet. “Everybody&#39;s asleep on the couch,” Henrich said. “It&#39;s awesome to watch—it&#39;s truly societal behavior driving your load.”<br><br> He opened the blinds on the conference-room windows so we could see into the control room itself. It looked pretty quiet, with a lot of the workstations empty. “When does it ever get exciting?” I asked. A month later, my question was answered.<br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">n December 23</span> , people in the Tennessee Valley awoke to temperatures that had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/tennessee/2023/01/19/tva-blackouts-winter-storm-cold-aging-power-plants/69777671007/">plunged 40 degrees or more overnight</a> . Worse, both units of the Cumberland coal plant had shut down, because thick ice from a big storm had encased instruments on the exposed boilers. In the morning, the Bull Run coal plant wouldn&#39;t start, and some natural-gas plants failed too. As demand soared to an all-time winter record of 33,427 megawatts, the operators in Chattanooga found themselves about 8,000 megawatts short. Neighboring utilities couldn&#39;t help; the storm had affected half the country.<br><br> For two hours that morning, TVA had to instruct its 153 local power companies to cut demand by 5 percent. On Christmas Eve, it asked for a 10 percent cut for more than five hours. To comply, the LPCs shut off power neighborhood by neighborhood for 15 minutes or more at a time. The rolling blackouts were the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2023/jan/31/tva-looking-into-ways-to-avoid-future-outages-tfp/">first in TVA&#39;s 90-year history</a> . At Christmas dinner, Fiedler told me, his mother required him to explain why his storied organization had cut her power on the holiday. “She wore me out,” he said.<br><br> TVA likes to boast of its reliability, and environmental advocates seized on the Christmas failure. “The emperor has no clothes,” Amanda Garcia, the director of the Southern Environmental Law Center&#39;s Tennessee office, told me. “The winter storm to me provided a perfect example of why TVA needs to change”—by showing that fossil fuels are no guarantee of reliability and that it should be transitioning to renewables faster. The Sierra Club ranks TVA among the very worst American utilities for its energy transition. The Center for Biological Diversity calls it a “climate laggard.” Both want the agency to replace all its coal plants as soon as possible with renewable energy, not gas.<br><br> A modeling study released in March by the Center for Biological Diversity and by GridLab, a nonprofit consulting group, concluded that TVA could indeed stop burning both coal and gas by 2035. To do that, it would need to build the equivalent of about 145 large solar farms, with a total capacity of 35 gigawatts, in its territory, along with the transmission lines needed to import about 12 gigawatts of wind power from the Midwest. (The Valley isn&#39;t windy enough to produce cost-effective wind power.) Then, by 2050, it would have to nearly triple that expansion again in order to electrify and decarbonize the Valley&#39;s economy. The goals are ambitious, given the delays that now plague many renewable and transmission projects—but the benefits to society would dwarf the costs, the study found. Consumers would save more than $250 billion, mostly from switching to cars that run on TVA&#39;s electricity rather than gasoline. Carbon emissions would drop by hundreds of millions of tons.<br><br> The first step toward a clean-energy future, advocates agree, would be to reduce energy waste in the Valley. About a quarter of homes there rely on resistance heating—the method employed in electric furnaces and space heaters. Many heat pumps also fall back on it at freezing temperatures, Huntsville Utilities&#39; president and CEO, Wes Kelley, told me. “That is basically the equivalent of turning on a bunch of big hair dryers to heat your house,” Kelley said.<br><br> According to National Renewable Energy Laboratory <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://resstock.nrel.gov/factsheets/TN">estimates</a> , efficiency measures, including more and better heat pumps, could save roughly as much electricity as the Cumberland gas plant will generate. “If you reduce that resistance heating, you&#39;re helping the system as a whole”—by reducing the peak load—“as well as the customer,” Maggie Shober, the research director at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE), told me. Because people in the Valley use so much electricity, monthly bills are high even though rates are low, creating an especially heavy burden on the poor.<br><br> Utilities generally have little incentive to invest in energy-saving measures, which only reduce their revenue. But TVA should be different: It doesn&#39;t need to make a profit. Since 2018, it has run an admirable program, called Home Uplift, that provides heat pumps, weatherization, and other measures to low-income homeowners, all for free—but so far, only to 5,000 of the hundreds of thousands of Valley residents who might be eligible. TVA could do much more, SACE and other critics say, especially now that the Inflation Reduction Act is subsidizing energy-efficiency programs. For its part, TVA says it&#39;s planning more of these types of investments, including rebates to replace older and less efficient heat pumps. Fiedler, the TVA spokesperson, said the agency will lower energy costs in underserved communities by $200 million over the next five years through Home Uplift and other programs.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he environmental advocates</span> I talked with were all suspicious of TVA&#39;s clean-energy intentions. SACE&#39;s Stephen Smith, a close observer of the agency for more than three decades, thinks TVA is building gas plants now and planning nuclear for the future because large power plants are what it is comfortable building, and it has a monopoly on building them in the Valley. The future of the industry should lie in “shifting from central stations to a more distributed model that opens up a whole new powerful toolbox for fixing the climate crisis,” Smith said. “But TVA is not going there.”<br><br> He and other advocates see a “rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future,” to quote the most recent United Nations climate report, and in that stark light, TVA&#39;s current fleet of renewables looks inadequate, especially if you set aside the hydroelectric dams and focus on what it has achieved lately. It buys about 1,200 megawatts of wind from the Midwest; it has installed about 1,000 megawatts of solar capacity in the Valley. That&#39;s far less solar power, Amanda Garcia pointed out, than deployed by utilities in the Carolinas or Georgia. Though she acknowledged TVA&#39;s plans to expand solar over the coming decade, “actions speak louder than words,” she said.<br><br> But TVA is actually making a big effort these days, Gil Hough, the executive director of TenneSEIA, the state solar-industry association, told me. Hough worked for SACE from 2000 to 2010, promoting solar with Smith. Now he helps deliver it to TVA.<br><br> In the mid-2010s, he told me, the agency did indeed walk away from solar because it was focused on paying down its nuclear debt. Under Lyash, though, TVA has changed, Hough said. It may have only 1,000 megawatts of solar online—but it has more than 2,200 under construction or contracted. “TVA wants every megawatt we can provide them right now,” Hough said. “It&#39;s <i>us</i> who&#39;s holding <i>them</i> back.” Supply-chain disruptions have slowed solar projects and raised prices. But Lyash announced in May that TVA would award contracts this year for 6,000 megawatts of solar power, to be brought online between 2026 and 2029. “We are building as much solar as we can get panels for,” he said.<br><br> What got TVA&#39;s attention was the demand from large corporations, says Reagan Farr, the CEO of the Nashville-based Silicon Ranch, which owns and operates solar farms for TVA and other utilities. Farr told me that companies like Google and Meta, by insisting on renewable energy, convinced TVA that it could no longer fulfill its mission of economic development without expanding its solar capacity. “The power of these large companies—their procurement decisions drive actions,” Farr said.<br><br> Local resistance to solar farms is a growing problem, both TVA and the industry say. At the November TVA board meeting, Chief Operating Officer Don Moul <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/environment/2022/11/10/tva-memphis-coal-ash-to-build-solar-farm/69637542007/">announced a $216 million plan to build a 100-megawatt solar plant on top of the coal-ash pile at the Shawnee power plant</a> , in Kentucky. If it works, Moul said, as much as 1,000 megawatts of solar might one day rise from ash piles around the region—poetic justice, and a way to “alleviate some of the land challenges that we&#39;ve heard about from so many of our stakeholders,” Moul said.<br><br> One of TVA&#39;s key constituencies are the local power companies that distribute its electricity. Their perspective is often very different from that of environmental advocates. At a listening session before a February 2023 board meeting in Muscle Shoals, a dozen of their representatives got up to speak—not about renewables or climate change, but about the blackouts. They were a “black eye for all of us in the Valley,” said Brian Solsbee, the executive director of the Tennessee Municipal Electric Power Association and a former TVA employee. “How does TVA ensure it never happens again?” It needs new generation capacity, Huntsville Utilities&#39; Wes Kelley told me.<br><br> When it was Lyash&#39;s turn to speak, he said what he has said repeatedly: that TVA plans to use all available technologies to decarbonize. He promised a renewed focus on energy efficiency and an aggressive expansion of solar—but also of gas and, in the long run, nuclear. “Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket,” he said. Renewables, in his view, are one basket.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he Tennessee Valley</span> is going through a period of economic expansion that would make Roosevelt proud, and TVA, with its reputation for cheap and reliable power, is partly responsible. The Valley&#39;s new growth includes electric-vehicle, battery, and solar-panel manufacturers—the industries that will drive the electrification of America. When I first met Lyash in Chattanooga, where he had just presented TVA&#39;s Engineer of the Year award, he rattled off some of the names. “Ford, GM, Toyota, Mazda, Volkswagen, LG, SK—those industries are going to decarbonize transportation,” he said. “So we have to provide them the energy <i>now</i> .” Demand is growing already, and Lyash expects it potentially to double by 2050. A study last year by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which mapped how the grid might be decarbonized by 2035, in line with Biden&#39;s goal, assumed that demand might even double by then.<br><br> The decision to build a new gas plant at Cumberland comes in that context as well as that of climate urgency. In TVA&#39;s view, even if it could build enough additional renewables and transmission lines to replace the Cumberland coal unit it plans to retire by 2026, which it says it can&#39;t, solar and wind wouldn&#39;t offer “firm, dispatchable power”—power that&#39;s available regardless of weather or time of day. The basic problem, as the NREL report explains, is “seasonal mismatch”: There&#39;s not enough sunlight to meet peak demand on cold winter mornings and not enough wind on hot summer afternoons; both can be minimal for days.<br><br> Given this reality, is it reasonable to build a new gas plant today, even though it will emit some carbon for years to come? I put the question to Paul Denholm, a senior research fellow at NREL and the lead author of the recent study. “That is a fantastic question, and it&#39;s something everybody is trying to figure out,” he said.<br><br> All visions of a decarbonized grid and of an electrified, net-zero society require huge expansions of wind and solar power. But the NREL study foresees that a net-zero grid will also need some kind of gas to meet peak demand. In three of its four net-zero scenarios, turbines are still burning substantial amounts of natural gas in 2035, and the carbon is being captured rather than released into the atmosphere. In all scenarios, many gas turbines are retrofitted to burn zero-carbon hydrogen.<br><br> TVA&#39;s vision of the future, as Lyash and Aaron Melda explained it to me, aligns broadly with the NREL study. Any gas plants that TVA builds now, they said, will one day either burn “green hydrogen” or involve carbon capture—neither is in wide use yet, and TVA is investing in both. The reason TVA won&#39;t promise a net-zero grid by 2035, Lyash said, is because “it&#39;s going to take deploying technologies that are not currently available at a price people can afford and a scale that can be implemented.” The NREL study assumes that those technologies will be developed in time to reach net zero by 2035; TVA doesn&#39;t want to count on that.<br><br> It&#39;s no surprise, Denholm said, that utilities are struggling to figure out how to cut the last 10 to 20 percent of their carbon emissions. NREL researchers haven&#39;t figured it out either. “The fact that you have conservative utilities saying they know how to [cut] 80 percent—that is a really remarkable shift,” he told me. “I think we need to recognize that and applaud it.”<br><br> Another influential report, Princeton&#39;s 2021 “Net-Zero America” study, included a scenario in which <i>only</i> renewable energy was allowed: By 2050, wind turbines were visible from about one-eighth of the area of the Lower 48 states, solar farms covered an area the size of West Virginia, and long-distance transmission lines mushroomed to five times their existing capacity. Even when such facilities share land with other uses—Silicon Ranch, for instance, allows sheep to graze or pollinator gardens to bloom among the solar panels—they are a significant industrial intrusion on the landscape.<br><br> In some regions, people may prefer less of those—and more of the compact central power stations that TVA knows how to build. The NREL and Princeton studies both include net-zero scenarios in which the expansion of renewable facilities and transmission lines is constrained, perhaps by “challenges with siting and land use,” as NREL puts it. Both scenarios rely, as does TVA, on nuclear plants. “I can&#39;t make the numbers work without new nuclear,” Lyash told me.<br><br> Like many nuclear engineers these days, he thinks the future lies in small modular reactors, or SMRs. At a site on the Clinch River, TVA is planning the first of what it hopes will be a fleet of 20 or so identical SMRs, using a relatively conventional design. “Our goal is not just to build a plant, but to build a plant that sets the model for the US industry,” Greg Boerschig, one of the engineers running the TVA effort, told me.<br><br> The way environmentalists focus on TVA&#39;s renewable capacity or lack thereof frustrates Lyash. “The point is,” he said, “what are your carbon emissions, and what&#39;s your price, and what&#39;s your reliability?” Different regions with different starting points—Arizona has a lot of sunshine, Oklahoma has wind, TVA has a legacy of nuclear and hydro—might reach their clean-energy goals in different ways.<br><br> Toward the end of our last conversation, Lyash opened an app on his phone that shows real-time carbon emissions from electricity generation. “One of the countries that gets held up as having deployed huge amounts of solar, and it&#39;s a big percentage of their capacity, is Germany,” he said. “Germany&#39;s carbon emissions right now are 426 grams per unit of electricity. And today, right now, TVA&#39;s is 247 … And our price is less than a third of theirs.”<br><br> That happened to be a bad day for Germany&#39;s numbers and a good one for TVA&#39;s—but long-term data confirm Lyash&#39;s point: Germany gets a far higher percentage of its electricity from renewables than TVA, but emits substantially more carbon per kilowatt-hour. Germany has made different choices. It closed its last nuclear reactor in April.<br><br> E <span class="smallcaps">nvironmentalists are right</span> to be wary of TVA. In the past it has performed badly on a variety of environmental issues. It built an unnecessary dam, the Tellico, that drowned important Cherokee cultural sites and hundreds of farms and notoriously threatened to extinguish a little fish, the snail darter. (The darter has since recovered.) It stepped back from solar and energy-efficiency efforts when it could have led the way. It was slow to reduce air pollution from its coal plants—which are still lethal polluters—and allowed the major coal-ash disaster in Kingston to happen. This May, even as Lyash was promising 6,000 megawatts of new renewable energy, TVA doubled down on its Cumberland decision: It released a draft environmental-impact statement saying that it also wanted to replace the Kingston plant with gas power by the end of 2027. That will lock in higher emissions for longer, environmentalists say.<br><br> Garcia and Smith think TVA lacks public accountability. They point out that it has no independent public-service commission to regulate it, only a board that, like corporate boards, has no staff of its own and thus depends on management. They would like to loosen TVA&#39;s monopoly and free local power companies to buy power elsewhere, bridling the “unicorn” with market discipline.<br><br> But that would risk undermining the very thing that makes the agency such a precious unicorn: the public-power model. TVA has retained political support, at least in its sphere, for an active government role in improving people&#39;s lives. And in a region where environmental causes are hardly unifying, TVA has said, publicly and repeatedly, that it wants to stop emitting carbon as fast as it can. How it does that should be debated—but in many conversations with TVA and its critics, I never heard a solid reason to doubt its good faith.<br><br> As I traveled the Tennessee Valley, I visited monuments from TVA&#39;s golden age, including Wilson Dam, in northwestern Alabama, with its lofty, sunlit turbine hall and arches like a Roman aqueduct&#39;s, and Norris Dam, in northeastern Tennessee, which closes off the narrow Clinch River with a tall, sculptural curve. TVA engineers and the people of this region built these marvels “for generations yet unborn,” as Senator George Norris liked to say,  with no notion of how valuable they would become in an age of climate change.<br><br> Now it&#39;s time to build more.<br><br> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article is part of the</i> Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">Planet series supported by the HHMI Department of Science Education.</i></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 16:44:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tennessee-valley-authority-energy-transition-nuclear/674729/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tennessee-valley-authority-energy-transition-nuclear/674729/</item></channel></rss>
