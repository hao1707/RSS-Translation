href="https://historicjamestowne.org/history/the-first-general-assembly/">全体会议</a>，颁布了“为居住在那里的人民提供快乐指导和治理的正义法律”。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://historicjamestowne.org/history/the-first-general-assembly/">由总督乔治·耶德利爵士组成</a>；他的四位议员；和 22 名当选的“公民”或代表，该团体批准了 30 多项措施。其中包括该国<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/page/1619-laws-enacted-by-the-first-general-assembly-of-virginia">第一部枪支法</a>：<br><br><p>任何人不得向任何印第安人出售或给予任何物品、子弹或火药，或任何其他进攻性或防御性武器，否则将被视为殖民地的叛徒，一旦事实得到证实，将被处以绞刑，不得赎回。</p>在早期的枪支管制例子之后，出现了更多限制枪支拥有和使用的法律。如果枪支一直是美国社会的一部分，那么枪支法也是如此。<br><br>这一事实可能会让一些枪支权利倡导者感到惊讶，他们似乎认为美国的过去是枪支所有权不受管制的时期。这一观点在 2022 年得到了大力支持，当时最高法院在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf"><i>纽约州步枪和手枪协会诉布鲁恩案</i></a>中宣布，现代枪支法的合宪性取决于它们是否“符合这个国家枪支管制的历史传统”。 ”换句话说，任何现代枪支法的宪法标准都归结为你是否能在 1700 年代或 1800 年代找到一个好的先例。<br><br>支持者的假设是，这样的先例很少见，但由于研究人员的工作和档案材料的数字化，现在可以参考数千条旧枪支法，各种可以想象的种类。枪支管制法规在美国历史上绝非罕见，而是默认法规。如果<i>布鲁恩案</i>的目的是废除许多枪支法的宪法基础，那么它应该会失败。<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/repository/search-results/?_sf_s=indian">都颁布了与詹姆斯敦类似的法律</a>，以防止枪支落入“敌对者”之手，但这些法律通常是无效的。在接下来的两个世纪里，直到内战之前，对奴隶叛乱的普遍恐惧促使许多殖民地以及后来的州颁布法律<a data-event-element="inline

个州颁布了许可法，通常在某种形式的监督下允许奴役和自由黑人携带武器。<br><br>在共和国历史的这段漫长时期中，直到 20 世纪初， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/guns-across-america-reconciling-gun-rules-and-rights-robert-spitzer/9780190228583?affiliate_id=atl-347">枪支法</a>对各类公民——特别是契约仆人、流浪者、非新教徒、拒绝向政府、重罪犯、外国人、未成年人和受酒精影响的人宣誓效忠。许多法律规范狩猎行为以及枪支的携带、使用、储存和运输；规范枪支的制造、检验、储存和销售；征收枪支许可证；以及受限制的危险或不寻常武器。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/freedmen-race-neutral-supreme-court-affirmative-action-clarence-thomas/674641/">Adam Serwer：最高法院法官提出的最令人困惑的论点</a><br><br>尽管托马斯意见声称“历史记录显示在 18 世纪和 19 世纪完全禁止使用武器的‘敏感地点’相对较少”，但一些地方当局也禁止在城镇、建筑物或道路内或附近开枪。例如天黑后、周日、公共集会和墓地。在某些司法管辖区，任何使用浪费火药的枪支的行为也构成犯罪。<br><br>对违反这些法律的典型处罚是罚款和监禁的结合。在 1700 年代和 1800 年代，由于 1791 年第二修正案的通过和 1868 年第十四修正案的增加，这是法官们主要关注的时期，违反枪支携带和狩猎法也可能导致没收。<br><br>当然，其中一些法律解决了当时特有的问题。例如，从 1600 年代到 1800 年代中期，对保存火药的担忧<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4007491">非常重要</a>，因为它的相对稀缺性使其成为一种珍贵的物质，无论数量如何，手头持有都是危险的，如果储存或处理不当，它很快就会降解。然而，其他类型的法律更直接地对应于现代枪支法规。<br><br>以在公共场合携带枪支或其他危险武器为例。早在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/the-grants-concessions-and-original-constitutions-of-the-province-of-new-jersey-page-289-290-image-293-294-1881-available-at-the-making-of-modern-law-primary-sources/">1686 年</a>，新泽西州就颁布了一项法律，禁止任何“私下佩戴任何袖珍手枪、绞绳、细高跟鞋、匕首或短剑，或其他不寻常或非法武器”的人，因为它们会引起“极大的恐惧和争吵”。这项法律还警告贵族们不要进行我们现在所说的公开携带：“任何<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncpedia.org/gentry">种植园主</a>不得骑马或携带剑、手枪或匕首，否则将受到处罚。”新罕布什尔州于 1744 年通过了一项法律，对任何“携带棍棒或其他武器（包括火器）”且拒绝驱散的十几人或以上的非法集会进行处罚。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1749-51-mass-acts-339-an-act-for-preventing-and-suppressing-of-riots-routs-and-unlawful-assemblies-chap-12-%c2%a7-1/">1751 年</a>，马萨诸塞州也效仿了这一做法。弗吉尼亚州和北卡罗来纳州分别于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1786-va-laws-33-ch-21-an-act-forbidding-and-punishing-affrays/">1786 年</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link"

年</a>通过了类似的禁止公开携带武器的法律。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=4825&amp;context=lcp">在革命后的 1800 年代</a>，随着暴力犯罪的增加导致更多的人武装自己，共有 42 个州（加上哥伦比亚特区）颁布了禁止隐藏携带武器的法律。 1900 年代初又有三个州这样做，因此总数几乎涵盖了联邦的每个州。从 1700 年代到 1900 年代，许多国家也颁布了某种形式的武器许可法。<br><br>那不是全部。同一时期，至少有 22 个州限制携带枪支，包括长枪。此外，在整个时期，四分之三的州制定了禁止“挥舞”（以威胁或威胁的方式挥舞枪支）或仅仅在公共场合展示武器的法律。<br><br>对于现代美国人来说，隐蔽携带就等同于携带手枪。但在 1700 年代和 1800 年代，单发手枪不可靠且不准确，格斗刀成为主要问题。其中最臭名昭著的是鲍伊刀，以吉姆·鲍伊 (Jim Bowie) 的名字命名，据说在 1827 年的一场<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/jim-bowie-stabs-a-louisiana-banker-with-his-famous-knife">战斗</a>中，吉姆·鲍伊 (Jim Bowie) 使用其兄弟雷辛·鲍伊 (Rezin Bowie) 送给他的一把“大刀”杀死了一名男子并打伤了另一名男子。 1836 年这位冒险家在德克萨斯州阿拉莫的死亡事件进一步放大了这种现象，这<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gunandswordcollector.com/product/bowie-knife-norm-flayderman/">刺激了对这把刀的需求</a>，但也刺激了禁止携带这把刀的法律的颁布。 1830 年代，至少有 6 个州通过了此类法律；到本世纪末，除了一个州外，每个州都限制了鲍伊刀。<br><br> <a

<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1763-1775-n-j-laws-346-an-act-for-the-preservation-of-deer-and-other-game-and-to-prevent-trespassing-with-guns-ch-539-%c2%a7-10/">新泽西州 1771 年的一项法律将</a>“任何装弹枪的设置方式定为犯罪，即该枪应自行爆炸或放电，或通过任何绳子、绳子或其他装置放电”。从 1850 年代到 1900 年代初，至少有 17 个州颁布了反陷阱枪法。<br><br>据我所知，陷阱枪的使用相对较少，但涉及陷阱枪的事件引起了媒体的广泛关注。缅因州班戈市的一份报纸于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/663175190/?terms=%22trap-gun%22&amp;match=1">1870 年 10 月 27 日</a>报道，一名闯入纽约市一家商店的窃贼被机关枪“炸掉了头顶”。该杂志认为，“需要发生一些这样的‘事故’，给最近在这座城市里活动的小偷一个教训。”但大多数当代评论支持反陷阱枪法，因为存在无辜者受伤或死亡的风险，也因为人们对这种私刑式的正义感到厌恶。<br><br>到 19 世纪末，美国发生了巨大的变化，成为一个以城市为主的国家。向工业大都市社会的转变恰逢更便宜、更可靠的手枪的大规模生产和流通增加，导致凶杀案和其他枪支犯罪的增加。新世纪的另一个标志是现代警务的出现，它具有更大的能力来解决这些日益严重的问题；这一发展反映在旨在应对美国城市公共秩序和安全挑战的新一代枪支法中。因此，纽约的<a data-event-element="inline link"

src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/O_Q86vYrTAtNCkvI_NfZ8VZKN7I=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/how_to_john_wilson_2hr/original.jpg" alt="约翰·威尔逊 (John Wilson)，来自 HBO 的“如何与约翰·威尔逊 (How to With John Wilson)”" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>托马斯·威尔逊/HBO</figcaption></figure>每当我试图向从未听说过该节目的人推荐<em>《如何与约翰·威尔逊》时</em>，我都很难弄清楚从哪里开始。 HBO 将其作为电影制片人约翰·威尔逊 (John Wilson) 的纪录片系列进行营销，在片中他探讨了纽约市最古怪居民的怪异行为。但称其为“纪录片系列”感觉不太对。是的，该节目依赖于威尔逊在城市中漫步时收集的镜头和采访，但这些材料也以喜剧方式呈现。而且它并不完全是“关于”任何事情：有时一集会从一个主题转到另一个主题，以至于到半小时结束时，你几乎不记得自己是从哪里开始的。<br><br>描述威尔逊本人也很困难。表面上他是该剧的明星，但他很少出现在镜头前。相反，他用第二人称的视角来讲述观众所看到的一切，讲述自己的经历。 （例如，当他居住的大楼进行彻底翻修时，他观察到该建筑“很快就把你的公寓变成了你住过的最吵闹的地方之一。”）用他布偶般的声音和尴尬的喉咙——清理时，他听起来经常因为外出而感到紧张。相机似乎是他的盾牌，是他与拍摄对象进行目光接触而不必直视他们的方式。在第一季中，他采访的一位室内设计师温和地批评他有这个习惯。 “我会爱你，有时在你的生活中，在你的脑海中，你会说，‘在这种情况下我应该放下相机，’”她说。 “‘我应该是约翰。’”<br><br>在该剧的最后一季中，威尔逊似乎吸收了她的建议。这位电影制片人之前曾通过提及人际关系和他的朋友，并结合他年轻时的档案片段来展现他的个人生活。但第三季在拆除威尔逊与他的节目之间构建的层层方面取得了重大进展。周五的剧集“如何锻炼”是一系列剧集中的第一集，威尔逊将镜头转向自己，并开始定期在他长期探索的纽约市行政区之外冒险。结果是威尔逊迄今为止最脆弱和最雄心勃勃的作品。如果说在前几季中他是用<em>“如何”</em>来理解周围的世界，那么现在他有目的地试图理解自己，并在这个过程中强调了他的方法的局限性。该剧表明，记录现实总是涉及一定程度的捏造。<br><br>威尔逊被誉为一位慷慨的纪录片导演，他愿意跟随他的拍摄对象深入兔子洞，不加评判地聚焦他们的激情。与喜剧演员兼<em>How To</em>制片人内森·菲尔德 (Nathan Fielder) 制作的非传统系列剧《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/07/the-rehearsal-tv-show-review-nathan-fielder/670546/"><em>排练》(The Rehearsal)</em></a>非常相似，威尔逊的作品因此看起来可能会有些不舒服。两者都展现了我的喜剧，因为他们的主题对他们最奇怪的痴迷是多么天真地开放。在威尔逊的例子中，他故意跟踪那些似乎渴望被倾听并想要解释自己怪癖的人，例如他在杂货店<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIs5tOBDAyM&amp;ab_channel=TheOncomingStorm">遇到的</a>一个男人，他提到他对曼德拉效应的迷恋，曼德拉效应是一种人们集体错误记住重大事件或事件的现象。细节。尽管威尔逊在旁白中从未评论过他所拍摄的内容的奇怪之处，但这些剧集无论如何都传达了他的观点。本季早些时候，他和一名试图将家人搬进没有窗户的导弹发射井的男子一起度过了一段时光。在整个序列中，威尔逊使用了一种令人难以忘怀的配乐，听起来就像是一部阴谋惊悚片，似乎是为了强调这个男人的强迫症对威尔逊来说是多么可笑。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/07/the-rehearsal-tv-show-review-nathan-fielder/670546/">阅读：你从未见过像<em>《排练》</em>这样的东西</a><br><br>然而在最新一集中，威尔逊直面自己将人们的怪癖变成娱乐的冲动。当他前往参加 9 月 11 日主题的健美比赛时（这项赛事具有明显但令人震惊的喜剧潜力），他询问了多名参赛者对他们本应纪念的攻击的记忆，但当他收到的答复是关于精神上的痛苦时，他变得沉默了。艰苦的健美运动也可以。威尔逊遇到一名声称他曾经与一名劫机者共事的培训师后，他在简短的问答后故意剪掉，转而播放一部他小时候在 9/11 录制的自制超级英雄电影。就好像威尔逊本人太痛苦了，无法继续让其他人过度分享，所以他作为替代方案介入，跟随自己进入其中一个兔子洞。<br><br>对于威尔逊来说，这是一种出人意料的技巧，而且当他审视那天下午他为什么要拍一部电影时，也是一种发人深省的技巧。他思考自己作为电影制片人的角色，并思考他的平台如何改变了他，进而改变了他所做的工作。他剪下了自己僵硬地站在艾美奖红地毯上的片段。他插入了他拍摄的埃隆·马斯克(Elon Musk)、玛莎·斯图尔特(Martha Stewart) 和迈克尔·布隆伯格(Michael Bloomberg) 的镜头——这些粗体字的名字是他在高档宴会上与他共用房间的。他提请人们注意，因为他有一档以他的名字命名的 HBO 节目，他的相机如何从他的盾牌变成了他的武器；他放大了时代广场上空的自己的广告牌。 “你喜欢认为你只是从远处观看所有这些事情，”他严肃地叙述道，“但也许这就是你现在的样子。”<br><br>这个坦白让我想起了威尔逊在节目第一集中表达过的一些话。 “你与某人交谈的次数越多，”他沉思道，“就越难隐藏自己的真实身份。”三个多季的<em>《如何》</em>从来都不是一部真正的纪录片或喜剧，而是对故事讲述者和主题之间的微妙界限的探索，以及客观记录现实是多么不可能。威尔逊的好奇心塑造了这部剧，但尽管他试图让自己远离他所观察的内容，但他自己的特点影响了播出的每一秒。 “现在的一切都是表演，”他曾在接受采访时轻蔑地<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/magazine/how-to-john-wilson.html">说</a>，因为他解释了为什么他会被拍摄普通人及其平凡的生活所吸引。在最后一季中，威尔逊听起来似乎已经接受了自己不仅仅是一个偶然发现滑稽人物的纪录片制作人的事实。相反，他是一个扮演角色的角色。<br><br></div>

18 年，她因出色的筹款活动和战略敏锐性而受到赞誉，并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2023/06/penn-amy-gutmann-university-president-salary">获得了丰厚的报酬</a>。值得注意的是，她<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://penntoday.upenn.edu/spotlights/vice-president-joe-biden-lead-penn-biden-center-diplomacy-and-global-engagement">于2017年2月</a>主持成立了宾夕法尼亚大学拜登外交和全球参与中心，该中心最初由乔·拜登领导，乔·拜登同时被任命为宾夕法尼亚大学本杰明·富兰克林总统实践教授。<br><br>拥有一位前副总统并不是一件小事，古特曼和拜登似乎已经建立了牢固的关系。 2018年，当拜登的孙女梅西·拜登申请宾夕法尼亚大学入学时，他<a data-event-element="inline link"

2019 年秋天进入了宾夕法尼亚大学，并于今年春天毕业。那时，古特曼已经在柏林安顿下来了。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Annie Lowrey：为什么你必须关心这 12

<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/henry-v/read/5/2/">礼仪制造者</a>”。通过将富人和有权势的孩子与指定弱势群体的孩子混合在一起，他们产生了新的进步精英，对国家的文化和政治生活拥有巨大的影响力。现在，随着常春藤+的招生实践受到左翼和右翼的严格审查，这种强大的炼金术正面临风险，为一批新的精英培养机构打开了大门。<br><br>古特曼杰出的前任美国驻德国大使之一是詹姆斯·布莱恩特·科南特（James Bryant Conant），他曾担任美国驻德国高级专员，然后在冷战初期担任美国首任驻德国大使。与之类似的是，科南特在担任哈佛大学校长 20 年后担任了这一职位。<br><br>在科南特时代和古特曼时代之间，美国的精英高等教育达到了其权力的顶峰。但科南特对哈佛大学的愿景和古特曼对宾夕法尼亚大学的愿景截然不同。<br><br>科南特出身于波士顿的工人阶级童年，他曾致力于将哈佛从一所 WASP 精英的精修学校转变为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-big-test-the-secret-history-of-the-american-meritocracy-nicholas-lemann/9780374527518?affiliate_id=atl-347">一所更加精英化的机构</a>，他要求大学管理人员找到一种能力倾向测试，以选拔全美最聪明、最优秀的人才。有能力的年轻人，这构成了后来SAT的基础。他相信哈佛可以帮助实现“杰斐逊的理想”，即一个由热心公益的知识精英领导的国家，这些精英是通过严格的、基于证据的程序选出的。对于许多美国人来说，科南特论文的某些版本是哈佛大学和类似机构地位提升的最令人信服的理由，这就是为什么背离精英理想往往会破坏常春藤联盟精英的合法性。<br><br>这种<i>精英主义的精英主义</i>从未在实践中得到充分实现，尤其是在常春藤盟校。其一，科南特本人主持了犹太人的配额制度，他被指责<a

href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/194316">至少</a>对反犹太主义的祸害漠不关心。此后的几十年里，一大批大学管理者放弃了精英统治，转而建立了一种不同的、可以说更强大的精英基础。精英高等教育不再一心关注学术卓越，而是采取了更加多元化的方法，将仅根据学术证书选择的学生与其他旨在丰富大学生活的学生混合在一起，无论是象征性的还是字面意义上的。在这一时期的大部分时间里，这些对精英管理范式的背离被视为对筹款和其他平淡的制度目标的必要性的让步。然而，近年来，这种招生多元化品牌在道德上发生了转变。称之为<i>进步精英主义</i>。<br><br> 1995 年 5 月，时任劳伦斯·S·洛克菲勒大学政治学教授兼普林斯顿大学教务长的古特曼在斯坦福大学发表了备受尊敬的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_resources/documents/a-to-z/g/Gutmann96.pdf">坦纳人类价值观讲座</a>。她的言论集中在种族不平等上，她称之为“这个国家公共生活中在道德和智力上最令人烦恼的问题”。<br><br>古特曼的核心论点之一是，因为“有效解决种族不公正问题的公共政策和个人实践是集体利益”，“黑人批评那些从他们打击种族不公正的努力中受益但无所作为的其他黑人是公平合理的”帮助这一事业或同样紧迫的事业。”也就是说，美国黑人“需要团结起来，通过支持平权行动政策等方式打击种族不平等”。<br><br>古特曼认为，不仅仅是美国黑人在这一领域负有特殊义务。 “我们承受的种族负担越少，”她认为，“我们克服种族不平等的义务就越大。”非黑人美国人“负有与种族不公正作斗争的特殊义务，以减少他们成为不公平优势受益者的可能性，这些不公平优势源于社会职务的种族成见和其他形式的制度化不公正，使黑人不公平地处于不利地位。”<br><br>如果古特曼是对的，即优势个人和群体有特殊义务避免加剧种族不平等的不公平优势，那么我们应该如何理解拜登总统为确保他的孙女进入宾夕法尼亚大学而做出的共同努力——或者更确切地说，我们应该如何期待政治哲学家艾米·古特曼明白吗？<br><br>一个可能的解决方案是，为达到目的不择手段。也就是说，如果特权阶层有利于种族和社会正义的更大事业，那么他们利用自己的地位、关系和财富来获得高地位的教育机会是合理且适当的。<br><br>处于古特曼立场的人可能会坚持认为，因为她控制的机构与她和她的同龄人认为值得的事业保持一致，所以招收能够增强其中心地位和声望的学生本身就是一种崇高的追求。对平等主义的承诺不仅赋予宾夕法尼亚大学和类似的大学道德许可，而且赋予他们以国家最有特权家庭的子孙来强化学生群体的道德义务。这样做为像古特曼这样的进步大学校长提供了塑造美国新一代精英的强大工具。<br><br>至关重要的是，这个精英塑造项目需要一个更广泛接受的合法性理论。如果说精英精英主义的合理性在于需要向最优秀、最聪明的人灌输爱国主义和公民责任感，那么进步精英主义的合理性在于需要使美国精英多元化。这意味着增加美国黑人和其他历史上处于不利地位的群体在美国公共生活中扮演重要角色的代表性，但这也意味着保护和加强常春藤盟校作为机会瓶颈的作用。在进步精英主义的影响下，常春藤盟校不仅仅是王朝财富与第一代奋斗者的活力交汇的地方。这是美国精英获得道义认可的地方。<br><br><i>学生公平招生诉哈佛</i>案揭示了这种精英培养方法在实践中的运作方式。学生公平招生是一个反对种族偏好的非营利性法律倡导组织，它聘请杜克大学劳动经济学家彼得·阿尔西迪亚科诺（Peter Arcidiacono）来分析谁被哈佛录取，谁没有被哈佛录取，并利用了该校多年来有义务与他人分享的严密保护的数据。原告。他的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Glenn_Loury/louryhomepage/teaching/Affirmative_Action/Meeting_V/supporting_documents/Doc%20415-8%20-%20(Arcidiacono%20Expert%20Report).pdf">专家证词</a>揭示了该大学的招生做法在多大程度上使亚裔美国申请者处于不利地位，这激起了保守派对种族意识招生的批评。阿西迪亚科诺和他的合著者还<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26316">提请注意</a>哈佛大学对招募的运动员、遗产、院长感兴趣名单上的未来学生以及教职员工子女 (ALDC) 的偏好，在某些情况下，这种偏好非常大。<br><br>对阿尔西迪亚科诺的发现感到震惊，批评者和种族意识招生的拥护者联合起来谴责对 ALDC 的偏好，这是跨意识形态一致的罕见例子。但种族偏好和对 ALDC 的偏好从根本上来说是互补的，正是这种互补性成为进步精英主义的基石。<br><br>越来越多的证据表明，精英教育的主要优势不是教学质量，而是它提供的与有权势人士建立关系的机会。在<i>《纽约时报》</i>最近的一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/opinion/alumni-affirmative-action-legacy-admissions.html">专栏文章</a>中，普林斯顿大学社会学家沙姆斯·汗 (Shamus Khan) 描述了来自特权阶层和弱势背景的学生的社会联系如何能够为后者带来好处。<br><br>汗写道：“从精英学校毕业，你可以加入一个杰出的组织，为你提供与身居高位的朋友的联系，并让你适应高地位环境的惯例和礼仪。”但是，虽然来自特权背景的学生甚至在进入哈佛或宾夕法尼亚大学等院校之前就可以接触到富裕、受过教育、有专业成就的成年人的网络，但地位较低的学生却不能。当这些学生聚集在一起时，那些享有特权的学生会获得一种被认可的感觉——他们的智力、成就和性格——而那些地位较低的学生则获得社会和文化资本，从而加速他们大学毕业后的职业提升。<br><br>尽管可汗并不是传统偏好的捍卫者，但他观察到，“传统学生拥有深厚的社会和文化联系，是弱势学生从精英学校获得如此多好处的部分原因。”这种逻辑不仅适用于传统学生，也适用于其他特权学生，包括杰出民选官员的子孙、主要慈善家、学术和文化名人，甚至可能还有成就斐然的马术运动员和壁球运动员。<br><br>进步精英主义不仅仅塑造精英大学学生的举止、道德和生活轨迹。它使招生人员能够更大规模地参与灵魂艺术。<br><br> 2010 年，经济学家瓦莱丽·拉米 (Valerie Ramey) 和加里·拉米 (Garey Ramey) 发现，自 20 世纪 90 年代中期以来，名牌大学入学<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2010a_bpea_ramey.pdf">竞争的加剧</a>导致受过大学教育的美国父母投入到孩子成长上的时间和资源急剧增加。相比之下，加拿大家长之间的竞争并没有相应增加，因为加拿大高等教育的声望等级没有那么陡峭。雷米夫妇的结论是，这种激烈竞争的最终结果是一场浪费的、零和的“老鼠赛跑”。<br><br>在此实证基础上，散文家马特·菲尼走得更远。在他 2021 年出版的新书<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/little-platoons-a-defense-of-family-in-a-competitive-age-matt-feeney/9781541645592?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>《小排》</i></a>中，他谴责了选择性大学招生的傲慢态度，指责招生官员对有抱负的父母及其孩子的内心生活拥有非凡的权力。<br><br>菲尼认为，面对千禧一代成年后激增的申请，“招生人员开始认识到，这场比赛赋予他们的选择权也是一种深刻而微妙的道德力量……他们现在可以告诉申请者哪些课外活动是<i>更好</i>，以及在招生论文中哪种个人自白更令人愉悦，他们更喜欢什么样的人，正如这些论文和课外活动中所体现的那样。”通过向父母、老师、辅导员和极易受到地位小等级影响的焦虑的年轻奋斗者传达这些行为偏好，招生官员发现“他们现在可以诱导申请者成为这样的人。”<br><br>许多学者和从业者呼吁利用选择性大学招生的方式，以多种方式“推动”家长和学生。例如，2017 年，托马斯·斯科特-雷顿 (Thomas Scott-Railton) 在<i>《耶鲁法律与政策评论》</i>上发表了一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://yalelawandpolicy.org/shifting-scope-how-taking-school-demographics-account-college-admissions-could-reduce-k-12">具有挑衅性的文章</a>，敦促精英大学向就读于高贫困 K-12 学校的申请者提供大量入学奖金，即使他们不是来自低收入家庭。家庭本身的收入。他认为，“通过奖励就读社会经济一体化学校的申请者，大学将调动全国私人参与者的资源来实现一体化。”<br><br>撇开这一特定提案的优点不谈，它说明了精英高等教育对国家中产阶级及以上家庭的非凡影响力。斯科特-雷尔顿的提议可以被视为让常春藤联盟机构推进国会可能会拒绝的政策目标的一种做法。在文化多元化的社会中达成立法协议非常困难。赢得招生办公室的支持要轻松得多。<br><br>这种纪律权力具有意识形态特征，而且并不总是微妙的。 2018年，耶鲁大学的一名招生官员发布了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://admissions.yale.edu/bulldogs-blogs/hannah/2018/02/23/support-student-protests">一份说明</a>，安抚潜在申请者，并承认学生不会因参与枪支管制活动而受到高中停学或其他纪律处分。 “对于那些来到耶鲁大学的学生，”她写道，“我们希望他们精通社会正义问题。”想象一下类似的便条，为耶鲁大学的潜在申请者参加“生命大游行”而欢呼——然后想象一下发布它的招生官员将受到的谴责。<br><br>结果是，精英大学招生的机会瓶颈在进步的管理者和招生官员的手中，变成了将进步的虔诚转化为精英社会规范的工具。<br><br>这让我们明白了为什么常春藤盟校的精英可能已经达到顶峰。<br><br>如果进步精英主义允许选择性大学将道德进步主义与作为其理想来源的精英主义调和起来，那么当常春藤盟校招生官员重塑社会规范的权力不再受到种族正义的呼吁时，会发生什么？自从最高法院的<i>“学生公平招生</i>”决定限制了种族偏好以来，遗产偏好就受到了猛烈的攻击，尤其是来自拜登政府的攻击，拜登政府已经对哈佛使用这种做法发起了<a

月宣布也将效仿</a>。如果沙姆斯·汗是对的，尽管针对弱势学生的精英教育的象征价值可能会在传统招生结束后持续存在，但其作为社会和文化资本来源的价值将大大削弱。<br><br> <a

Inboden）领导，他最近在德克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校任教。佛罗里达大学盖恩斯维尔校区拥有超过 60,000 名学生，已成为全美最受尊敬的公立大学之一，鉴于阳光之州<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-06-29/millions-move-to-the-south-as-us-economy-favors-its-wealth-job-opportunities">经济和人口的快速扩张</a>，它已做好进一步发展的准备。汉密尔顿中心旨在促进思想多样性并提高校园和全州公民教育的质量，代表着对佛罗里达大学巨大潜力的赌注。一种可能性是，它将成为一所新文理学院的苗床，与宾夕法尼亚大学和哈佛大学等大学竞争，吸引来自不同社会和种族背景的聪明、有能力的学生。迄今为止，佛罗里达大学尚未成为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2022-college-guide/national/">社会流动性的灯塔</a>。但这种情况可能很快就会改变。<br><br>没有人指望这些刚刚起步的努力能够将常春藤盟校及其同行从美国高等教育地位等级中的顶端地位驱逐出去，至少目前还不会。我们可以说的是，许多美国年轻人和他们的家庭正在寻找我们所知道的精英教育的替代方案，越来越多的公民企业家希望复兴仍然引起共鸣的精英理想。<br><br></div>

class="smallcaps">天气很冷</span>，即使是八月的旧金山也很冷。当莱昂内尔走过左撇子奥杜尔桥时，风似乎从各个方向吹来——太平洋、海湾、脚下的咸水小溪。每走一步，莱昂内尔的左鞋都会吱吱作响，考虑到他刚刚换好鞋底，这尤其让人抓狂。多年来，他一直路过一家地下鞋匠店，认为让这位古老的罗马尼亚店主参与某个项目既古老又有趣。最后，莱昂内尔走进了这个人的小店，请他给他最喜欢的皮鞋换鞋底，皮鞋很软，感觉就像鹿皮鞋一样。整个遭遇正如预期的那样古怪而令人满意，直到一周后莱昂内尔取回鞋子，发现左边的那双现在每走一步都会发出卡通般的吱吱声。<br><br>当莱昂内尔回到鞋匠那里时，老人耸了耸肩。 “有些鞋子会吱吱作响，”他说。<br><br>莱昂内尔学会了用左脚边缘走路。这降低了声音，但让他的步态令人担忧。体育场里的人们开始询问他这件事。<br><br>莱昂内尔为<i>《审查者报》</i>报道了巨人队的比赛——至少是主场比赛。该报没有足够的预算让他上路。无论如何，这个赛季实际上已经结束了。球队无缘季后赛，俱乐部内气氛低沉。并不是说球员们在获胜时如此喋喋不休。西德尼·科莱蒂（Sydney Coletti）做到了这一点。<br><br>她被任命为媒体关系部门的负责人，对队员们进行言语纪律方面的训练，日复一日，他们发出一些有意义的词组，但什么也没说：“努力做出贡献。” “只是专注于赢得胜利。” “伟大的团队努力。” “很高兴来到这里。”<br><br>西妮穿着漂亮的西装，在体育场里大步走来，乌黑的头发上嵌着墨镜。仿佛意识到自己的专横情绪，她经常带来糖果、纸杯蛋糕、大块手工巧克力。她衣着光鲜、热情，但如果有记者碰到她，她会毫不犹豫地限制她的接触。所以莱昂内尔用坦诚换取了接触，并为此厌恶自己。<br><br> “干得好，莱昂内尔，”西德尼在认可他写的东西时说道。以这种方式受到赞扬是一件可怕的事情。<br><br> “让我粘住，”莱昂内尔的编辑沃伦要求道。<br><br>问题是，当一名球员说了一些甚至含糊不清的话——沃伦用这个词来形容令人难忘、丰富多彩、有争议的事情——体育记者就会猛扑过去，而球员往往会为此付出代价。随之而来的是道歉，失去了代言合同，变化无常的球迷的喜爱减少，要求交易，一支新球队。那样的话，或者玩家就可以闭嘴了。<br><br><i>吱吱，吱吱，吱吱。</i><br><br>莱昂内尔从体育场的媒体门进入，穿过昏暗的走廊来到更衣室，向保安格雷戈里奥展示了他的挂绳。<br><br> “汉娜打败了你，”他说。<br><br> “怎么打我？”莱昂内尔说道，他认为可能有 10 种、12 种方式中的任何一种。她在那里采访赫克托·希门尼斯。<br><br>从技术上讲，田中汉娜是他的竞争对手，因为她为<i>《纪事报》</i>撰稿，这是两位勇敢的当地人中规模较大的一位。但从他开始参加巨人队比赛开始，她就竭尽全力帮助莱昂内尔——把他介绍给体育场的每一位工作人员，分享每一个提示和数据点——他很快就爱上了她。她是那么稳重，那么风趣；她的笑声刺耳，近乎淫荡。<br><br><i>吱吱，吱吱，吱吱。</i><br><br>听到他的话，她转过身来。她拿出笔记本和手机——她有一些转录应用程序，可以立即将玩家所说的所有内容转换为文本——但她看着莱昂内尔，傻笑着。那个坏笑！好主啊。<br><br>不过，她已经结婚了，并且有两个十几岁的女儿，所以莱昂内尔一年比一年更善于掩饰自己的心痛。比赛期间，他们坐在一起，开玩笑、抱怨、交换意见，她低声咬紧牙关说的每一句话，都让他感到刺痛，因为他发现自己最喜欢的人坐在旁边，这是一种巨大的不公平。每天都有她，但每天都是独自回家。<br><br>莱昂内尔环顾四周。他可以和二垒手霍利斯交谈，霍利斯的脚后跟有些问题，但这有什么意义呢？沃伦不会给他空间来报道另一支失败球队的球员差点受伤的消息。<br><br>汉娜结束了希门尼斯的谈话，侧身走到莱昂内尔身边。 “看看这个新人，”她说，并向角落里一个瘦长的男人点了点头。她把当天的媒体包递给莱昂内尔，并指着有关中中继投手内森·库图尔 (Nathan Couture) 从 AAA 萨克拉门托征召入伍的相关段落。 “在悉尼戴上枪口之前抓住他，”汉娜说。<br><br>角落里的那个人正将制服的袖子分开，显然惊讶地发现自己的名字“ <span class="smallcaps">COUTURE</span> ”被缝在了巨人队球衣的背面。<br><br> “内森？”莱昂内尔问道。<br><br>投手转身微笑。他的牙齿很小，左犬齿也缺失了。这让他看起来青春不完整。他有一张窄而麻子的脸，下巴也很脆弱。他严厉干裂的嘴唇上挂着稀疏的小胡子。<br><br> “第一次参加大满贯赛？”莱昂内尔问道。<br><br> “确实如此，”内森说。<br><br>这个词——在更衣室里很少听到。莱昂内尔在笔记本上写下了“确实”，然后提出了体育界最愚蠢、最常见的问题。 “感觉如何？”说出这句话很痛苦。<br><br>但内森点点头，通过鼻孔大口吸气、呼气，仿佛这是他听过的最具挑衅性的问题。<br><br> “就在昨天，当我接到电话时，我很高兴，”内森说。<br><br>莱昂内尔听到了口音。乡村的。也许是东南部。乔治亚州？他写下“兴高采烈”并划了线。<br><br> “从萨克拉门托开车过来是一个狂热的梦想，”内森继续说道。 “风景如融水般急速流逝。然后来到这里，来到这座大教堂，热身，并与这些处于技术巅峰的人会面”——他用手臂环顾房间，现在房间里挤满了十几名穿着毛巾和下体的球员；一个人摇晃着腿，仿佛要唤醒它——“无条件地受到他们的欢迎，现在在这件衬衫上看到我的名字……我不得不说，这太棒了。”<br><br>莱昂内尔写道并强调了“崇高”。他环顾四周，看看自己是不是被恶作剧了。但没有人在听；附近没有人。<br><br> “抱歉，我不知道你的名字，”内森说道，并伸出了手。莱昂内尔做了自我介绍，发现内森正在以友好但令人不安的强度审视他的脸。他的目光落在莱昂内尔的笔记本上。 “你会速记吗？”他问。<br><br>莱昂内尔的笔迹是草书和全大写的混乱混合体——疯子的潦草字迹。 “不，不，”他说。 “我想这只是我的个人密码。”<br><br>四年来，没有球员问过有关莱昂内尔的过程或职业的哪怕是最模糊的问题。<br><br> “我想你会称我为熟练工，”内森说。<br><br>莱昂内尔刚刚写下了这个词。他很快就把它划掉了。<br><br> “别，别，”内森说。 “我喜欢这个词，对我来说它很贴切。远离棒球，这是一个好词，你不觉得吗？旅人。我知道不是每个人都喜欢它，因为它暗示着一种低于成功的炼狱，但孤立地看，这个词有一种简单的美，对吧？你怎么可能不想被称为旅行家呢？”<br><br>莱昂内尔看着他擦掉的单词。 “大概吧。”他把它圈起来。当他再次抬头时，内森正低头看着他，带着教士般的兴趣。<br><br> “你小时候梦想过这份工作吗？”他问。<br><br>莱昂内尔说不出话来。他又回到了这个假设：这是一个恶作剧。他看了看周围。没有人回头看。<br><br> “对不起。我不应该这样试探。”内森说着，将一只手放在了莱昂内尔的肩膀上。 “我突然意识到，我们两个人正处于令人羡慕、甚至超现实的境地，正在实现我们最不可能的梦想。事实上，我们不是在挖沟渠或开采煤炭——我是被付钱来玩游戏的，而你是被付钱来观看游戏并告诉人们你所看到的——在一个充满悲伤和不幸的世界里，这似乎是是一件非常幸运的事情。你不觉得吗？<br><br><span class="smallcaps">莱昂内尔茫然地看着</span>比赛。他坐在新闻席上，汉娜坐在他的右边。他左边的是 Marco DaSilva，20 多岁，圆肩，痴迷于统计数据，出于某种原因做 AM 广播，平均听众为 76 人。Lionel 一遍又一遍地读着他的笔记，同时希望 Nathan Couture 会这么做。被叫去推销。<br><br> “有趣的家伙？”汉娜问道。<br><br> “他的数据很糟糕，”马可说。<br><br>对他们隐瞒任何事情都是不对的，但莱昂内尔却对这次奇怪的采访保密。巨人队输得很惨，内森没有参加比赛，在途中的某个地方，汉娜对莱昂内尔心不在焉的状态感到厌倦，走到马可旁边坐下，并表现出在这种新的座位安排中度过了特别愉快的时光。<br><br>莱昂内尔（Lionel）编写了游戏，但由于内森（Nathan）不是其中的一个因素，因此将他包括在内是没有意义的。莱昂内尔想，他迟早会玩，到那时他就可以让他进入一个故事了。也许沃伦会让他做一个侧写。或者可能不是。沃伦一般不喜欢人性化的故事。<br><br>那天晚上，莱昂内尔上网寻找内森·库图尔。他的家乡是阿拉巴马州托马斯维尔。他今年 28 岁，从未上过大学。他的统计数据在各方面都表现平淡，这意味着他不太可能在大联盟中停留很长一段时间。他既普通又老。一个平庸的投手，很高兴加入大联盟，谁询问了莱昂内尔的工作和方法？他在想什么？<br><br>内森第二天被送回萨克拉门托。<br><br>当内森走出去时，他在警告跑道上等待，长长地吸了一口气。他走上草地，就像走上皇家楼梯的第一步一样。<br><br>莱昂内尔写下了那周比赛的总结，打印了球员们的愚蠢言论，悉尼烤的白巧克力布朗尼蛋糕也很出色。<br><br> “实际上，我不喜欢她烘焙，”马可说。在另一个凉爽的八月下午，他和汉娜以及莱昂内尔正在观看击球练习。<br><br> “她的饼干很脆，”汉娜说。莱昂内尔以前并没有这样想过悉尼的饼干，但它们肯定是易碎的。很快，三人就将体育场内的所有食物都打开了。上一季还很脆的蒜蓉薯条现在不那么脆了，披萨上的小意大利辣香肠也掉了几个档次。<br><br> “还记得它们还是卷曲的时候吗？”莱昂内尔问道。<br><br>投诉之门现已敞开。他们一致认为，公园的建筑师没有分配足够的电梯，因此编剧们经常不得不等待——有时甚至要等待几分钟——才能从场地到达记者席。<br><br> “还有纸巾！”马可突然悲惨地说道。<br><br>在离记者席最近的浴室里，纸巾分配器已被空气干燥器取代，他们都认为空气干燥器噪音太大。<br><br> “好吧，”马可声音疲倦地说，“我想我们应该进去安排今晚的阵容。”<br><br>莱昂内尔抓起西德尼放在他小房间里的副本，看到了内森的名字。他感到一阵兴奋，这让他感到尴尬。<br><br> “时装又回来了，”汉娜说，莱昂内尔点点头，没有透露任何信息。<br><br>比赛开始，到了第六局，巨人队以 5-0 领先，他们不太可能需要内森。他是名单上的第三或第四中中继投手，而且首发球员的表现仍在飙升。<br><br>但教士队在左、右浅区连续打出一记单打，比分突然变成了5-3，然后是5-4。主教练走到投手丘上接球，首发球员低着头嘀咕着走向休息室。莱昂内尔看着牛棚，看看谁会出现。<br><br>当内森走出去时，他在警告跑道上等待，长长地吸了一口气。他像皇家阶梯的第一步一样走上草地，然后开始稳步小跑。其余的入场和准备工作都是例行公事。他踢了泥土并进行了热身赛。他的脸出现在外场巨大的屏幕上，出现在一张傻乎乎的照片中，两万名球迷漫不经心地想知道​​他是谁。然后，他毫不费力地用三球三振了第一个击球手。<br><br> “该死，”马可一边说，一边疯狂地打字了一会儿。莱昂内尔认为他正在为刚刚发生的事情寻找一些数字背景。<br><br>下一个击球手击中了左侧的绳子。三垒手维恩布伦纳将球击倒，但将球击倒，第一垒上有一名跑垒员。<br><br>当第三名球员将运球者击中二垒时，霍利斯笨拙地将球传给游击手，游击手踩到二垒并投向一垒，形成双杀。<br><br> “好吧，”汉娜说。 “好的。”对于汉娜来说，这是很高的评价。<br><br>下一局，内森以几乎相同的方式处理前三名击球手——巧妙的投球选择和精确的位置。当第三名击球手对球犯规时，内森追赶球，短暂地迷惑了一垒手，一垒手挥手示意他离开并接住了球。<br><br>在局间休息时，汉娜接到了一个神秘的电话。<br><br> “嗯，”她说。显然，二垒手霍利斯正在接受核磁共振检查。一直困扰他的脚后跟现在被击中了。在那双打过程中发生了一些事情。<br><br>更有经验的投手结束了第八和第九场比赛，仅此而已。巨人队以 5-4 获胜。在更衣室里，霍利斯的脚后跟很早就受到了不好的评价。沃伦不想听内森·库图尔的故事，更不想听先发二垒手受伤的那晚。不管怎样，莱昂内尔还是走到了内森身边。大多数球员已经洗完澡了，但内森还穿着队服。<br><br> “这很老土吗？”内森问道。 “我想再细细品味一下。”<br><br>霍利斯拄着拐杖摇摇晃晃地走进房间，记者们蜂拥而至。专业的做法是去听听这位赢得四次金手套并获得 1200 万美元报酬的球员的意见。但莱昂内尔留在了内森身边。<br><br> “我注意到你第一次走出去时停了下来，”他说。<br><br> “我做到了，”内森说。 “我想你想知道那是什么感觉？”<br><br>莱昂内尔微笑着，戏剧性地舔了舔笔尖。<br><br> “它很大，”内森说。<br><br>莱昂内尔写下了“它很大”，有那么一刻，他怀疑内森早先的口才是否是侥幸。<br><br> “开玩笑吧，莱昂内尔。确实，我认为这是一个令人高兴、完全不合理的景象，”他说。 “你不觉得吗？我是说-”<br><br> “坚持住，”莱昂内尔说，然后抓起他的录音机。<br><br>内森深吸了一口气。 “我的意思是，那些上层甲板的座位可能高 200 英尺。想一想吧。今晚有两万五千人来到这里，其中一些人坐在 200 英尺高的空中，观看人们玩着有史以来最愚蠢的游戏。球、球棒和垒——当然，所有这些都完善和专业化，但本质上是幼稚和无关紧要的。为了服务它、庆祝它，这座耗资十亿美元的体育馆被建造起来。人们不远千里来到 100 英里，在 1,000 盏灯光下观看。你我第一次见面的时候，那是一天的比赛，完全不同的气氛。到了晚上，体育场呈现出深空的感觉。天空是那么黑，灯光是那么白，照亮了一片超现实的绿色海洋。当你像我一样在黑暗中慢跑时，短暂地感觉就像你在一艘宇宙飞船里，正在接近一个新星球。”<br><br>接球手赫克托·希门尼斯（Hector Jiménez）的储物柜就在内森的储物柜旁边，他开始听着，并用不满的眼神看着内森。<br><br> “那个界外球引起了一些混乱，”莱昂内尔说道，内森已经点头了。<br><br> “首先，”他说，“那个球理应是古铁雷斯的，但它从我头顶上方开始，然后东北风把它吹向一垒线。所以我曾经看到过它，但后来它就消失了。我的意思是，它不再是了！”<br><br>莱昂内尔引起了希门尼斯的注意。他看起来很惊慌，很惊恐。<br><br> “很长一段时间，”内森继续说道，“当我在虚空中寻找球时，我想，<i>我已经抓住了一百万个球。我怎么会失去这个呢？</i>然后我想，<i>我为什么在这里？我的腿在哪里？我的手臂还举着吗？为什么我看不到？</i>天空一片漆黑，这个棒球这个实体的东西，彻底消失在了其中！所以我想知道这个球是否是真的，我是否是真的，是否有什么是真的。”<br><br>希门尼斯把他的装备扔进行李袋里，大声拉上拉链。<br><br> “然后我闻到了烤牛肉的味道！”内森说着，放声大笑，把手放在莱昂内尔的肩膀上。 “我想，我闻到<i>的是烤牛肉的味道吗？谁把烤牛肉带到了球场？</i>然后古铁雷斯喊道：“走吧，孩子，我明白了！”我的目光转向他。当他们这样做的时候，我看到第一排看台上有 1000 张模糊的面孔。然后他接住了球。”<br><br>希门尼斯走开了。几秒钟后，悉尼出现了。当采访时间过长时，她总是会产生怀疑。<br><br> “这里一切都好吗？”她问。<br><br> “好吧，”莱昂内尔说，但采访结束了。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">莱昂内尔不得不</span>等待几天，霍利斯受伤的戏剧性事件才上演，然后才要求沃伦在报纸上留出一些空间来介绍内森。沃伦对此兴趣为零，尤其是因为内森没有再打比赛。但有一天，一则广告被删除，因此在第 23 页，莱昂内尔被分配了六英寸的专栏来介绍“内森·时装，具有独特前景的投手”。在悉尼把他赶走之前，他只是打印了从内森那里得到的两段长引言，但这篇文章给人留下了深刻的印象。<br><br> “你必须给我播放那盘磁带，”汉娜显然有些怀疑。<br><br>所有的记者都想采访内森，但内森突然没空了。西德尼觉得，让这个古怪的阿拉巴曼人不断地喋喋不休，他们已经躲过一劫，并以某种方式避免了灾难性的错误。她不会再冒险了。但后来她说她会的。<br><br> “业主坚持这样做，”沃伦说。<br><br>这位八十多岁的球队老板显然读过莱昂内尔的文章，并且立即成为内森文章的粉丝。他希望内森参加比赛，并希望内森在比赛前后尽可能多地说话。店主本人被认为是个怪人（尽管来自堪萨斯州），被认为不会在这个世界上待太久。内森第一次出战三天后，他在另一场紧张的比赛中投出了第八局，他再次保住了自己的位置，巨人队获胜。这一次，他必须击球，并且实际上将直线球击入了三重巷。内森违背一垒教练的意愿，绕过了一垒，并在二垒轻松被标记出局。这是一场滑稽又多事的一局，主场球迷陷入了疯狂。<br><br>随后，一群记者围住了他，不明智地等待电梯的莱昂内尔发现自己来到了第三环。他感到一种奇怪的专有感，甚至被抛弃了。他希望内森承认他与众不同，承认他是第一，这在某种程度上让他感到羞愧。<br><br>内森环顾四周，露出灿烂的笑容。 “嗯，这真是非同寻常。”<br><br>汉娜是最接近的。 “一般的想法，时装先生？”<br><br>内森盯着天花板看了一会儿，仿佛要揭开层层询问，然后将目光落在她身上。<br><br> “首先我想到了青草的气味，”他说。 “他们今天割了它，所以气味很新鲜，只是有点酸，就像新割的草一样。有某种东西既湿又干，既死又活。我吸的时间比平常长了一点，想要把一切都看清楚，然后我看到四个头发花白的男人手挽着手在看台上摆姿势拍照。然后大屏幕上播放了一张这些人在青少年时期观看球赛的照片。同样的四个人，同样的姿势，就在五十多年前。而且我有一种感觉，他们四个人，每当这样并肩站着的时候，大概都会有一种所向无敌的感觉。”<br><br> “内森，我——”<br><br>另一位记者插话道，以为内森已经完蛋了。但莱昂内尔知道他不是。<br><br> “然后我看到了一只海鸥。也许你也这么做了？它在本垒上方盘旋了一会儿，大约 20 英尺高。在灯光的照射下，它就像一个小天使。我想知道是什么让这只鸟独自来到球场。毫无疑问，他希望自己能找到一些被丢弃的薯条或薯条，但风险也相当大。灯光和三万人会不会让人望而生畏？但话又说回来，他会飞。当你可以飞的时候，有什么令人畏惧的吗？我简短地思考了飞行的本质。我确实认为有一天人类或多或少可以像鸟类一样飞行，我想知道这将如何影响我们的自由观念。如果有人能够飞翔，他们会在精神上还是物质上感到受到限制吗？”<br><br>莱昂内尔写下了“如果我们能飞”。<br><br> “然后就到了投球的时候了，”内森说。现场传来阵阵笑声，还有眼神交流。内森本人比莱昂内尔文章中的他更加陌生。十几只手举了起来。<br><br> “哦天哪，”内森说。 “我只是一直这样说下去。而且你可能还有很多其他玩家可以交谈。我们为什么不进行快速循环呢？交易？”<br><br>前面有人问：“第一次被击中是什么感觉？”<br><br> “如果你还记得的话，”内森说，“我在前两次投球时犯规了。犯规就像你在生活中犯的每一个错误一样：你把你所有的一切都投入到一项任务中，如果只是一点点错误，它就足以让整个努力白费。球无处可去，或者比无处可去还要糟糕。但当木棒的杆身击中球时，你什么感觉也没有。没有抵抗力。什么都没有。球飞向天空。斗争已经过去了。”<br><br>马可插了进来。“内森，你的四缝线平均旋转速度很稳定，为 2320，在中中继投手中排名第九，但今晚，你最后三名击球手的平均旋转速度为 2090。你有计划解决这个问题吗？” ？”<br><br>当马可说话时，内森的脸色松弛下来，目光呆滞，当马可说完后，他说：“说实话，马可，我没有什么永远爱的想法。”<br><br>一个穿着淡蓝色运动服的秃顶男人举起了手。这是《<i>洛杉矶时报》</i>的汤姆·维洛。他很可能会来到北部，给旧金山的新景点泼冷水。<br><br> “你能告诉我们跑步的事吗？”他问。 “你看起来有点生锈了。”<br><br> “事情有我想象的那么糟糕吗？”内森说道，脸上露出了一个极其尴尬的笑容。 “你知道，尽管我击球时很自然，但跑步却相反。我感觉自己就像穿着一千年历史的盔甲奔跑。当我到达二垒时，球已经到了二垒手的手套里。他像新郎等待新娘一样等待着我。当他把我标记出来时，我松了一口气，我想投入他的怀抱。”<br><br>汤姆笑了。 “在广播里，他好像对你说了些什么。”<br><br> “他做到了。他说，“<i>美乔</i>，现在你可以休息了。”内森看着墙上的时钟。 “我们应该快点。现在超高速。”<br><br> “接住球时的声音是什么样的？”一位年轻的网络记者问道。<br><br> “当我还是阿拉巴马州的孩子时，我的祖父住在后院的一座小小屋里。每天晚上晚饭后，我都会和他一起走回他的住处，他会亲吻我的头顶并说：“再见。”然后他关上门，关门的声音是低沉、潮湿、果断的咔哒声。这就是接住球时的声音。就像我祖父家的门被敲响一样。”<br><br>内森看了看时钟。 “好吧，最后一张？我看到你了，莱昂内尔。”<br><br>莱昂内尔站在后面，为内森感到高兴，但暂时觉得没有必要。他摇摇头。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">正是那场比赛</span>和那次采访，让内森·库图尔 (Nathan Couture) 登上了全国媒体。第二天，以及接下来的一周，他无处不在。 ESPN 做了一个片段，吉米·金梅尔让他出现在他的节目中。 With Sydney offering Nathan freely to all, the only thing Lionel could do was go to Phoenix.<br><br> Nathan&#39;s parents, though they&#39;d raised Nathan in Alabama, had moved to Arizona, and Warren green-lit a longer profile. In a stolen moment before a game, Lionel told Nathan he was thinking of going, and Nathan gave his blessing. “I trust you,” he said.<br><br> “Thank you,” Lionel said.<br><br> “You report accurately and you listen carefully,” he said.<br><br> “I try,” Lionel said.<br><br> “They are tremendous people,” Nathan said. “Immeasurably charming. You&#39;ll love them, and they you. I&#39;m envious that you get to see them. I&#39;ll call ahead and let them know I vouch for you.”<br><br> Lionel arrived at a comfortable ranch house 20 minutes from downtown Phoenix. A pickup truck was out front, and next to it, a small fishing boat rested on a trailer. Lionel rang the bell, and when the door opened, a thin couple in their late 60s stood before him, arms around each other&#39;s waists. Jim and Dot, short for Dorothy.<br><br> “Lionel,” Jim said.<br><br> “I took the liberty of pouring you a glass of ice water,” Dot said.<br><br> Lionel followed them in. He walked on the side of his left foot, but the squeaking was clearly audible. Lionel guessed, correctly, that they would be too polite to mention it.<br><br> “Come sit,” Jim said, and indicated a plush leather recliner in the living room. It was almost surely Jim&#39;s TV chair, and Lionel took the honor given. Nathan&#39;s parents sat to his right, on a matching couch.<br><br> “Nathan speaks highly of you,” Dot said.<br><br> “He does,” Jim agreed.<br><br> Lionel got his notebook out and looked around the room. He&#39;d expected a house full of books, but saw few. There were no trophies, either—no shrine to their son, the professional baseball player. An enormous TV dominated one wall. Next to it were two photos, from middle school, he guessed. One was clearly Nathan. The other was a girl, younger by a year or two, who shared a version of Nathan&#39;s goofy smile. But there was something knowing, even sardonic, in her eyes.<br><br> “So how does it feel,” Lionel asked, “with Nathan becoming this …” He almost said “curiosity” but instead chose “phenomenon.”<br><br> “Oh, it&#39;s been so nice,” Dot said.<br><br> “He worked hard,” Jim said. “Deserves it.”<br><br> Lionel smiled, thinking they were warming up. But they were done. Dot held her glass of water with two hands and smiled at Lionel in a motherly way. Lionel looked down at his notebook.<br><br> “So outside his skill as a pitcher,” he said, “one of the things that&#39;s gotten Nathan noticed is his way with words. Was he always loquacious?”<br><br> Dot winced. She looked to Jim. Jim chewed his cheek.<br><br> “I read your first article,” Dot said. “When you had him saying &#39;Indeed,&#39; right away I thought, <i>That&#39;s the comebacker</i> .” She pointed to her temple.<br><br> “He was never, you know, book smart,” Jim added. “That was his sister.”<br><br> “Never read a book unless you tied him down,” Dot said.<br><br> “He didn&#39;t talk a whole lot,” Jim said, “and when he did, he did it in a regular way. He was all laser-focused. That&#39;s how his coaches described him.”<br><br> “Single-minded. Then the comebacker happened,” Dot said.<br><br> “I&#39;m sorry. The comebacker?” Lionel asked.<br><br> “Well, he was hit by a comebacker,” Jim said, sounding surprised that Lionel didn&#39;t know. “In Sacramento. It was on the radio up there.”<br><br> “We were at the game,” Dot said. “It was awful. Nathan threw a fastball to a very big guy, I think he was from Nevada, and this guy hit the ball right back at him a million miles an hour. Hit him right here.” Again she pointed to her temple.<br><br> “From our angle, it looked awful,” Jim amended. “But later we saw it on tape, and it was more of a … It sorta grazed his head. The doctor checked him out and said he was okay. Nathan felt okay too. He pitched the rest of the inning and did fine. But then he took us out for dinner afterward, and it was like talking to some other person.”<br><br> “He had a $10 word for everything,” Jim said. “He said the wine was &#39;unafraid.&#39; I remember that. The wine was &#39;unafraid.&#39; That was new.”<br><br> “He did say that. He said a lot of things,” Dot said.<br><br> “He talked a lot that night,” Jim added. “We flew home the next morning, and a few days later, he gets called up to the Giants. Which is when you met him.”<br><br> “We figured the new way of talking was some temporary thing,” Dot said. “But then your article comes out, and he&#39;s still talking this way—&#39;indeed&#39; this and &#39;glorious&#39; that.”<br><br> “His sister talked like that. She was the reader.”<br><br> Lionel was afraid to ask.<br><br> “She passed young,” Dot said, and leaned forward, her hands on her knees. “It was a tumor. When they found it, it was too big.”<br><br> Jim cleared his throat. “Anyway. With Nathan, when he was talking like that, we put it together. It had to be the comebacker.”<br><br> Dot was nodding steadily, her eyes locked on Lionel. “Like something got knocked loose, and whatever was clogged up in there came pouring out. Sometimes people get hit in the head and start speaking another language.”<br><br> Jim nodded enthusiastically. “French, Portuguese, Turkish. But it seems like it&#39;s usually French.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">By the time</span> Lionel left, the impossible heat of paved Arizona had relented. He drove with the windows open, the red sunset behind him. He got back to the hotel and checked his messages. One was from Hannah.<br><br> “Sorry about your boy,” she said. “You probably know more than I do. Call if you want to compare notes.”<br><br> Lionel looked online and found a short blip about it. Nathan had been pitching in Cleveland when he blew out his arm. He left the park in a sling.<br><br> The professional thing for Lionel to do would be to return to Nathan&#39;s parents&#39; home and get their reaction. But he couldn&#39;t bring himself to bother them, and was so shattered that he sat on the bed and stared at the wall for the better part of an hour. Finally he got to his feet and drove his rental car to the airport.<br><br> Back in San Francisco, Lionel waited for news. For two days Nathan wasn&#39;t at the park, and no one had updates. Finally a press conference was called.<br><br> “How can a sequoia withstand a thousand years of earthquakes and fires and wind, and finally, one day, it just falls?”<br><br> The room was full. Lionel sat at the back. The team doctor came out and said they&#39;d done an MRI and consulted with the best specialists in the city. Nathan would need surgery, and even after that, the prognosis was not good. “I can&#39;t promise anything,” the doctor said.<br><br> And then Nathan walked in, wearing a coat and tie, his arm in a sling. He sat down. He looked warmly out at the throng of reporters, but before he could begin, Tom from the <i>LA Times</i> walked in late. “What&#39;s the prognosis?”他问。<br><br> The room groaned, but as always, Nathan treated the question with great decorum.<br><br> “If I were still 18,” he said, “I might be able to get the surgery. Then, in 10 or 12 months, I could return, though with reduced capacity. But I&#39;m almost 30, so there is no way back. Even if I did every last thing right, I&#39;d be, at best, a single-A player. And an old one at that.”<br><br> Hannah was in the front row. She raised her hand.<br><br> “Hi, Hannah,” Nathan said. “I&#39;m guessing you&#39;d like to know how it feels?”<br><br> She laughed and lowered her hand.<br><br> “It&#39;s a good question. At the moment, I&#39;m still stunned. Numb. I have to admit my imagination had gotten away from me, and I saw great glory ahead. I was looking forward to the rest of the season, to seasons to come, to the lights, all those people sitting 200 feet in the sky to watch this game. It&#39;s over sooner than I expected, for sure. So for the moment, I&#39;m adrift. Don&#39;t you cry now, Hannah.” He looked around the table for tissues. “All we have up here is water. Here,” he said, and poured her a tall glass from the pitcher. And as he did, time slowed. Every reporter in the room watched closely, as if they&#39;d never before seen water move from one vessel to another.<br><br> Nathan sat down again, and called on Lionel.<br><br> “Did you have any warning?” Lionel asked.<br><br> “You know, my friend, I really didn&#39;t. I felt good that day in Cleveland. But it&#39;s probably like any other thing. How can a sequoia withstand a thousand years of earthquakes and fires and wind, and finally, one day, it just falls? One afternoon, a gust comes and it gives up.” Nathan stood. “I&#39;ll miss you all. Hope I see you here or there or somewhere in between. Goodbye now.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Lionel walked</span> onto King Street, trying to figure out how to shape the story, or if he should bother. He still hadn&#39;t written about his time with Nathan&#39;s parents; his heart wasn&#39;t in it. When he turned the corner at Third Street, heading home, he felt a presence next to him.<br><br> “Caught up to you!” It was Nathan, out of breath. “I tried to find you at the park, and then was wandering around the neighborhood, hoping to run into you. I know you live around here. Then I heard the squeaking.”<br><br> They ducked into a burrito place. Lionel tried to order margaritas for them both, but Nathan declined. “I don&#39;t know why my mind is working the way it does now, but I don&#39;t want to mess with it.” He ordered a lemonade.<br><br> It was criminal to sit in that park, Lionel thought, with all that color, all that vaulting joy in a world of sadness and misfortune, and not do better.<br><br> Lionel ordered a lemonade too, and they sat by the window facing the park. “Your parents told me about the comebacker,” he said.<br><br> “Yeah, I figured,” Nathan said. “Funny thing is, I don&#39;t feel different, and I don&#39;t see differently than I ever did before. I&#39;ve always noticed the same things, but I guess that now I have the need, and maybe the words, to describe it.<br><br> “My sister was the eloquent one,” he continued after a pause. “My parents mention her?”<br><br> “A little bit,” Lionel said.<br><br> For a second Nathan smiled, as if thinking of her, of something she&#39;d said. “Anyway,” he said, “I&#39;ll be reading you, making sure you get it right.”<br><br> “I can do better,” Lionel said suddenly, and Nathan did not argue the point. It was criminal to sit in that park, Lionel thought, with all that color, all that vaulting joy in a world of sadness and misfortune, and not do better.<br><br> “You plan to fix the squeak?” Nathan asked.<br><br> “I took it back to the shoe guy,” Lionel said, “but he freed himself of any responsibility.”<br><br> “Can I?” Nathan asked, and Lionel took off his shoe and handed it to Nathan.<br><br> “It has to be an air pocket, right?” Nathan said. Even with one bum arm, he quickly found the pocket and aimed a fork at it. “Can I?” he asked again. Lionel nodded, and Nathan jabbed a strategic hole. “Try it now.”<br><br> Lionel put the shoe back on and walked a few steps. The squeak was gone. His relief was immeasurable. “Thank you,” he said.<br><br> They finished their lemonades and stepped back into the city. The lights were on in the stadium. Lionel had forgotten there was a home game that night. He turned to Nathan, thinking he&#39;d be wistful, but his eyes were sharp and happy.<br><br> “So what will you do now?” Lionel asked.<br><br> “I&#39;ve been thinking about that. Are you walking this way?” Nathan was heading toward the water, his gait loose. Lionel followed.<br><br> “Maybe you buy that Romanian shoemaker out.”<br><br> Nathan laughed. “You know,” he said, “a few years ago, I was in a high-rise in Guangzhou, visiting a friend at his office. Long story. But anyway, this was 42 floors up, and there was a man outside, cleaning the windows. He had one of those wide T-shaped tools for cleaning the glass—like a blade. You know the tool. So simple. He drenched the window with soap, applying it with such liberality. Just soaked this vast window overlooking this limitless city.”<br><br> Nathan turned to the towers of downtown San Francisco.<br><br> “And then, with the T-shaped blade, he slashed the surface of the glass with the precision and finality of a guillotine. He got every last white sud. As we watched, the view through the window went from muddy to crystalline.”<br><br> Lionel couldn&#39;t figure out what the connection was. Nathan wanted to be a businessman in a Chinese high-rise? And how had this minor-league pitcher from Alabama ended up with a friend in Guangzhou?<br><br> “So I thought I&#39;d like to do that job,” Nathan said. He meant cleaning the windows. “Not necessarily in Guangzhou, and not forever, but I&#39;d like to try that for a while. I like being outside.”<br><br> They&#39;d arrived at the water, and Lionel thought he should get back to the ballpark. He reached out to shake Nathan&#39;s hand. Nathan lowered his sling and took Lionel&#39;s fingers in his.<br><br> “Or babies!” he said, still pumping Lionel&#39;s hand. “You know how after babies are born in hospitals, there are nurses who hold the babies while the moms recover from the birth?

Danya Perry 告诉我。她说，阿维纳蒂被关进了关押墨西哥毒枭“矮子”的同一间牢房。 （阿文纳蒂后来<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/nyregion/michael-avenatti-trump-jail.html">声称</a>，他的治疗是时任司法部长比尔·巴尔下令偿还的；监狱长<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/22/michael-avenatti-rise-and-fall-house-arrest-profile-525301">表示</a>，他被单独监禁是因为“严重担心”他的安全，而巴尔称阿文纳蒂的指控“荒谬”。）<br><br>然而，斯通和阿维纳蒂都不像特朗普那么引人注目，特朗普可以说是美国历史上最著名的联邦被告。佩里怀疑楚特坎会在审判前监禁他。多年来，特朗普无视负责监督针对他提起的各种民事案件的法官的警告，并且从未面临过切实的后果。佩里说：“他已经完成了很多次，并且成功滑冰了很多次，这让他更加有勇气。”<br><br>事实上，特朗普还暗示他将无视楚特坎的禁言令。 “我会谈谈它。我会。他们没有剥夺我的第一修正案权利，”特朗普周三在新罕布什尔州的竞选集会上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/08/trump-on-possible-gag-order-pound-sand-00110357">说</a>。<br><br>特朗普诽谤检察官并再次将自己描绘成政治迫害的受害者，其政治动机很明显：他试图激怒他的共和党基础。特朗普在有关审判的公开声明中似乎也在执行某种法律策略。他称华盛顿特区为“肮脏且犯罪猖獗的尴尬之地”，可能是因为这些言论将迫使法院同意他的请求，将审判转移到潜在陪审员群体更友善的地点，例如西弗吉尼亚州。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/">大卫·A·格雷厄姆：特朗普的表现就像他被逼到了绝境</a><br><br>据我采访的前检察官称，这种做法不太可能奏效。 “如果看到这一举措取得成功，我会感到震惊，”前联邦检察官、华盛顿反腐败倡导组织公民责任与道德组织的负责人诺亚·布克宾德 (Noah Bookbinder) 告诉我。 “这有点像一个老笑话，说的是一个孩子杀死了他的父母，然后因为他是孤儿而请求宽恕。我只是不认为法庭会这么做。”<br><br>特朗普的攻击也给特别检察官史密斯带来了问题。一方面，检察官显然有兴趣确保证人不会感到受到威胁；另一方面，史密斯可能觉得试图让特朗普保持沉默会助长这位前总统的受害者叙事。司法部检察官提醒查特坎注意特朗普在法庭文件中发表的“我正在追捕你”的帖子，在今天的听证会上，他们表示担心，如果不加以限制，特朗普可能会披露有利于他的竞选活动的证据。 （特朗普的一位发言人表示，前总统的警告是“政治言论的定义”，并且提到了反对他的候选资格的“特殊利益集团和超级政治行动委员会”。）但史密斯的团队并没有要求查特坎完全堵住特朗普的嘴，甚至警告他他。 “你看到检察官非常非常克制，”布克宾德说。 “很多被告都在说检察官和证人的坏话，他们会立即进去要求被告停止这样做。”<br><br>布克宾德将特朗普帖子的引用描述为政府的“回击”，这表明他们正在密切关注这位前总统的公开声明。但和查特坎一样，史密斯可能不愿意将此事推得太远。布克宾德指出，与特朗普就禁言令展开争执可能会分散政府想要将案件重点放在特朗普涉嫌犯罪上的注意力，并且可能会满足他拖延审判的愿望。但特别检察官必须权衡这些担忧与失控的被告可能危及检察官和证人安全的可能性。 “我强烈怀疑杰克·史密斯不想去那里，”布克宾德说。 “我认为在某些时候他可能别无选择。”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 11 Aug 2023 17:38:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊插图。资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure>拉达·帕特尔（Radha Patel）<span class="smallcaps">在马里兰州长大</span>，她没有看到她所在地区的任何人使用媒人。 But she was aware that in India, where her parents had emigrated from, plenty of couples were fixed up—by relatives, respected elders, women in the community trusted to intuit good pairs.不知为何，这个念头一直在她的脑海里挥之不去。 2018 年这种情况依然存在，当时朋友们对约会应用程序感到沮丧，开始寻求帮助寻找爱情。 “我不是技术人员，”她想。 “我能做些什么？”然后她意识到<em>自己</em>可以扮演媒人。<br><br>她开始介绍人，这变成了一种爱好，并于当年晚些时候变成了一项生意，《Single to Shaadi》。 2020 年，Netflix 热门节目<em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/08/netflix-indian-matchmaking-and-the-shadow-of-caste/614863/">《印度婚介》</a></em> （讲述了来自孟买的职业丘比特的故事）播出后，她和她认识的许多媒人迎来了一波新客户。冠状病毒大流行可能是导致病例激增的原因之一；尤其是在早期，很多人不想进行不必要的面对面约会。也许他们还意识到，他们的时间太宝贵了，不能浪费在约会应用上毫无结果的刷卡上。 Patel 表示，从 2019 年到 2020 年，Single to Shaadi 的活跃客户数量翻了一番，第二年又翻了一番。<br><br>该领域仍然有动力。过去几年里，新的婚介公司<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/04/tired-of-swiping-left-singles-turn-to-new-matchmaking-services-.html">不断</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/style/what-its-like-to-work-with-a-matchmaker.html">推出</a>，我采访过的婚介者告诉我，他们最近的兴趣有所上升。一些约会网站也试图利用这一趋势。 2021 年，拥有 Tinder、Hinge 和其他几款约会应用程序的巨头公司 Match Group 在 Match.com 上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/match-introduces-a-human-matchmaking-element-to-its-dating-app-11637269774">推出了</a>一项功能，通过该功能，真人教练每周为愿意每周支付 4.99 美元的每位会员推荐两份个人资料。今年早些时候，Netflix 推出了一部衍生剧： <em>《犹太婚介》</em> 。<br><br>这一历史传统的某些方面似乎与当代社会很好地契合。在约会应用程序让用户对自己的浪漫生活拥有令人难以置信的控制权的时代，对于某些人来说，让别人来掌控方向盘似乎越来越有吸引力。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">在世界各地的社会中</span>，人们都向第三方寻求合作伙伴。在犹太社区，几千年来，学者和拉比等值得信赖的人物充当了<em>媒人</em>的角色。在日本，传统上会招募一位“<em>中间人</em>”来推荐浪漫的候选人。历史上，韩国家庭会拜访<em>中美</em>以寻求配对，而在中世纪的天主教社会中，乡村牧师有时也会发挥作用。在所有这些习俗和许多其他习俗中，媒人通常为符合条件的年轻人的父母工作。家庭，而不仅仅是个人，都被联系在一起。 <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/labor-of-love-the-invention-of-dating-moira-weigel/9780374536954?affiliate_id=atl-347">《爱的劳动：约会的发明》一书</a></em>的作者莫伊拉·韦格尔告诉我，至少在工业革命之前，许多文化中的婚姻通常都与农业有关：将家庭团结起来，分担农业劳动，并确保下一代能够继续下去。那个工作。<br><br>但韦格尔告诉我，从 19 世纪左右开始，工业化使许多家庭不再需要这种结合；爱情成为更普遍的理想。尽管相亲在许多文化中仍然很流行，但在许多其他文化中，寻找浪漫已成为一种更加个人化的追求。人们仍然得到一些非正式的帮助；朋友和家人可能会尝试为单身人士牵线搭桥，无论他们欢迎与否。但随后出现了约会应用程序——这是一种特别孤独的求爱形式。<br><br>网上约会不仅会让人感到孤独，而且还非常耗时。梳理这些应用程序感觉就像是一份兼职工作。 2016 年，Hinge <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2016/10/03/why-is-the-dating-app-hinge-bashing-swipe-apps/">报告称</a>，该应用程序上的滑动次数只有五分之一会导致电话号码被交换。同年，当该公司对其 300 名用户进行调查时，发现<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thedatingapocalypse.com/stats/">其中 81% 的用户</a>从未在任何基于滑动的约会应用程序上找到过长期关系。 2018年，约会公司Badoo对英国5000名18至30岁的人<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating-apps-millenials-10-hours-per-week-tinder-bumble-romance-love-a8174006.html">进行调查</a>时发现，用户平均每周在约会应用上花费10个小时。<br><br>所有这些工作都让约会者在爱情生活中比以前有更多的代理权。他们不需要等待一次偶然的邂逅，甚至不需要离开家。他们可以随时滑动、发送消息、约人见面。但这种控制感对许多人来说是一种祝福，也可能是一种负担——尤其是当你同时与几个追求者交谈时，这在应用程序中很常见。帕特尔称之为“DIY约会”：所有的分析和过度思考都涉及到——“<em>什么不起作用？什么是对的？</em> ……<em>我在消息之间等待的时间是否太长？电话那头的那个人是真的吗？</em> ——这一切都得你自己做。”<br><br>那么，难怪媒人会很高兴。许多有能力外包约会劳动力的人都渴望这样做。婚介服务的成本可能非常昂贵：虽然有些公司可能会承诺以几百美元的价格提供几次匹配，但许多公司会收取数千甚至数十万的费用，以获得为期 6 至 12 个月的会员资格或少数有保证的日期。但他们宣传的是一个细致的流程，专家根据客户的兴趣、价值观和对过去关系的评估，有条不紊地缩小大量候选人的范围。人们不会倾向于使用媒人，除非他们正在寻求长期承诺，因此客户可以非常有信心，他们不会在令人困惑的情况或歪曲的意图上浪费时间。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/04/couples-dating-defining-the-relationship-status-uncertainty/673650/">阅读：关系中最可怕的部分</a><br><br>媒人还可以在整个非常脆弱的约会过程中充当向导。为一个热情、令人安慰且……人性化的中介人进行算法交易可能很有吸引力。与应用程序不同的是，许多媒人会就如何寻找伴侣、如何展现自己、何时再给某人一次机会、甚至某人在人际关系中可能出问题的地方等方面提供建议。当婚介公司 Selective Search 让我联系他们的客户 Connie Weaver（一家人寿保险公司的首席营销官）时，我听说了这件事。她告诉我，在她的丈夫于 2020 年去世之前，她已经结婚三十多年了。当她在 60 多岁时再次开始约会时，她不知道自己想要什么，也不知道如何去寻找它。她是一位成功的高管和人际交往能力，擅长在任何商务会议上进行对话。 “但这并不意味着 35 年后，”她告诉我，“我在这方面很擅长。”在选择性搜索中，“有人拉着我的手给我信心，”她说。<br><br>韦弗的第二场比赛是她可能不会直接滑动的人，如果他们是在应用程序上的话。她不想和医学界的任何人约会——他的领域。 （她有过糟糕的经历。）但她决定对这个过程充满信心。 “你必须相信他们会从你身上吸引出<em>真正的你</em>，”她告诉我。四个月后，韦弗仍然见到他；虽然很新，但感觉很特别。 “我高兴极了，”她告诉我。 “每个人都说我容光焕发。而且我已经很久没有发光了。”<br><br>对于在约会世界中挣扎的人们来说，经验丰富的化学专业人士可以发现你内心深处隐藏的品质，并利用它们引导你找到你可能错过的人，这个想法可能非常诱人。但为了让媒人做到这一点，他们可能需要了解客户告诉他们的内容之外的内容。西北大学研究浪漫吸引力的心理学家伊莱·芬克尔告诉我，人类往往不太擅长推断我们自己想要什么。在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00466-005">一些</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51251730_When_and_why_do_ideal_partner_preferences_affect_the_process_of_initiating_and_maintaining_close_relationships">研究</a>中，研究人员询问参与者他们在寻找什么样的伴侣，结果发现他们的答案并不能预测他们真正喜欢的人类型。无论如何，人们往往会被相同的品质所吸引。如果你正在寻找一个有吸引力的、友善的、有趣的人，那么你并不完全是独一无二的。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/helen-fisher-science-online-dating-apps-tinder/672419/">阅读：让网上约会成为一门“科学”的女人</a><br><br>即使媒人试图不相信客户的话，芬克尔也认为提前预测兼容性本质上是一场艰苦的战斗。 “很多让我们与人相处融洽的因素都是<em>自然而然出现的</em>，”他告诉我。 “也就是说，它是在我们相遇<em>之后</em>才开始存在的。”即便如此，化学仍然是复杂而神秘的，并且部分取决于运气。他举了一个例子：也许约会时一个人说他们来自阿肯色州，另一个人说，<em>哦！这次公路旅行我去了阿肯色州，去了约瑟夫母亲熟食店。你到过那里吗？</em>晚上的进展情况可能部分取决于这个问题的答案，因为<em>“是”</em>和<em>“否”</em>会让谈话转向不同的方向。也许两个人都去过那里，他们交换意见，这会引发笑声，引发内部笑话，感觉就像火花一样。<br><br>但爱情的谜团也是媒人魅力的一部分。如果你自己没有答案，你至少可以希望别人能找到答案。韦弗告诉我，她认为相亲既是“一门艺术，也是一门科学”。一方面，令人欣慰的是存在可以破解的兼容性代码。另一方面，我们不希望浪漫过于临床，纯粹从几次采访或详细的调查问卷中推断出来。米哈尔·奈斯特 (Michal Naisteter) 是费城的一名媒人，也是播客<em>The Yentas</em>的联合主持人，他告诉我，这就是人们向她寻求帮助的部分原因，而且通常是向人类而不是算法寻求帮助。 “这个过程有些是神奇的，”她告诉我。 “这有点宇宙性。”<br><br>这就是现代的浪漫之道：人们需要效率，但也需要人性。他们想要独立，而不是依赖家庭，但他们仍然需要指导；他们想要选择，而不是仅仅从该地区的少数追求者中进行选择，但他们不想花几个小时来筛选他们。当代婚介是人类在爱情方面相互对立的冲动的支点：它试图平衡现代性和传统，将劳动力外包，并在不剥夺人们自主权的情况下，在孤独的约会世界中为人们提供一个盟友。<br><br>帕特尔只是众多试图向客户展示他们可以拥有这一切的媒人之一。她给她的公司起了一个口号：“不是你父母的媒人”，并且她对自己的流程进行了现代化改造：她不会根据种姓进行匹配。她强调与不同宗教以及不同性取向的人一起工作。 Single to Shaadi 不与客户的父母合作（尽管帕特尔还有另一家更以家庭为导向的婚介公司），帕特尔试图让她的服务相对实惠——起价略高于 100 美元——这样年轻的单身人士就可以在不涉及他们的情况下支付费用。家庭。这看起来和她从小到大听到的相亲有点不同，但也不是无法辨认。她还没有摆脱基本的福利：不需要确切知道自己想要什么的天赋，因为你不是独自做决定。<br><br><em><small>当您使用此页面上的链接购买书籍时，我们会收到佣金。感谢您对</small></em><small>大西洋月刊</small>的支持<em><small>。</small></em><br><br></div>

Threads 这样的新网站，还是想从 F​​acebook 这样的老网站中获得更多信息，这里都有一些关于如何在不使用社交媒体的情况下使用社交媒体的提示。<br><br><strong>举办一场街区派对。</strong><br><br>在现实生活中，如果有人闯入一群陌生人的聚会并开始大声辱骂并扰乱谈话，他们很快就会被赶出聚会。然而在社交媒体上，这种刻薄的​​行为不仅被容忍，有时甚至受到赞扬。在我们的日常生活中，对不当行为进行纪律处分是我们学习变得更好的方法。但由于这些规范在互联网上从未得到维护，许多空间变得有毒，许多人从未得到改掉坏习惯所需的反馈。阻止是反馈的一部分。当人们意识到如果以某种方式表达自己的意见就不会被听到时，他们就会停下来。即使他们不这样做，您也没有义务适应他们。您的社交媒体动态就是您的聚会，您可以决定宾客名单。这样做，你并不是脸皮薄，而是脸皮薄。您是一位尽职尽责、营造良好氛围的主人。<br><br><strong>正确地阅读房间。</strong><br><br> “阅读房间”的警告是社交媒体上最懒惰的反驳之一。对于那些理智上不严肃的人来说，这是一种通过示意想象中观众的反应来驳回争论而不涉及其实质内容的方式。但这个概念包含着真理的核心。在社交媒体上，我们都在不同的房间里工作，说话时会想到不同的人。许多在线冲突都是由交叉线造成的，当针对一种情况的对话（对志同道合的人来说是一个讽刺性的笑话）渗透到另一种情况（在不理解这个笑话的人之间）时。但这个问题有一个简单的解决办法：在发布内容之前，问问自己这是否是适合您要说的内容的平台。<br><br>有些声明是针对群聊的，而不是针对整个互联网的。其他人则受益于尽可能广泛的听证会。想要电视或旅游推荐吗？问问 Twitter 或 Facebook 的蜂巢思维。想分享您的风景假期吗？ Instagram 吧。想要讨论敏感的个人事务或解决棘手的政治问题吗？在聊天中与您的朋友联系，或者只是向值得信赖的知己发送私人消息。如果做得好，阅读房间不应该阻止你说出你想说的话，而是帮助你说出可以真正被听到的事情。<br><br> <a

Rosenberg：如何重新控制您在互联网上阅读的内容</a><br><br><strong>不要使用社交媒体作为公众舆论的代理。</strong><br><br>正是因为不同的平台有不同的用处，所以吸引了不同类型的人群和话语。这意味着这些网站并不能很好地反映民众情绪。举个例子，皮尤研究中心<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/">发现</a>，只有 23% 的美国成年人使用 Twitter（该网站现在被称为 X），而<a data-event-element="inline link"

的成年人。这没有什么问题。一般来说，每个社交媒体网站都服务于自己的利基市场和社区。当人们试图将这些平台当作他们不具有代表性的公众样本时，问题就出现了。这往往会导致对我们的世界做出<a data-event-element="inline link"

（这就是为什么像乔·拜登这样的政治候选人往往在社交媒体上表现不佳，但在投票箱上表现更好的原因之一。）在采用新平台和使用旧平台时，我们应该牢记它们的局限性，而不是不加批判地允许流行的内容他们影响整个公司或国家的进程。<br><br><strong>抵制愤怒的诱饵。</strong><br><br>

href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/13/likes-and-shares-teach-people-express-more-outrage-online">发现</a>，愤怒帖子的点赞和分享会鼓励那些发帖者在未来发表更多愤怒的帖子。总而言之，这些研究说明了社交媒体如何创建一个反馈循环，在这个循环中，平台本身鼓励用户逐渐发布更多关于敌人的精神错乱的言论。获得奖励的行为会被重复。<br><br>

Twitter 这样的平台就没那么宽容了——它更像是一串意识形态香蕉皮摆在数百万陌生人面前。每天，网站上的某些内容或其许多后继者都会诱使我们发表超出我们专业知识的评论。但我们不必这样做。<br><br>这种克制不仅能让你避免尴尬，还能防止你对最新的突发新闻反应过度，而且当你有重要的事情要说时，它还能帮助你发挥作用。你在网上公开武断地谈论的话题越多，你就越有可能犯错，让人们有理由对你所说的其他内容打折扣。这并不意味着您不应该在互联网上直言不讳！但你应该将自己限制在你最希望被听到或影响别人的实际专业领域。你最不想看到的就是你对文化战争问题的即兴看法会损害你对真正重要的事情的深刻见解。这也是为什么依赖公众信任来传达信息的记者和学者应该坚持自己的节奏，而不是发布超出其范围的主题。如有疑问，请回忆一世纪拉比的智慧，他<a

Doing this may seem harmless in isolation, but in practice, it&#39;s not happening in

class="smallcaps">any people say</span> they are looking for happiness. They spend a lot of time and resources searching for the secrets of well-being, like old-time miners prospecting for gold. But for some sages throughout history, this is the wrong approach. Happiness isn&#39;t something to be <i>found</i> ; it&#39;s something to <i>attract</i> .<br><br> Perhaps the most famous proponent of the second path was the Greek philosopher Aristotle. He defined happiness as <i>eudaemonia</i> , which means “good spirit.” To us moderns, this might sound vaporous, like the superficial happy feelings that so many people (incorrectly, in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/11/finding-happiness-and-meaning-in-politically-divided-america/672130/">my view</a> ) chase. Instead, the philosopher meant that happiness was a divine state that would visit each of us as it pleased. Our only responsibility was to open the door to it. And we do so by living well.<br><br> To live well, we should practice specific virtues and make them into habits. As Aristotle <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9">wrote</a> in his <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> , “If it is better to be happy as a result of one&#39;s own exertions than by the gift of fortune, it is reasonable to suppose that this is how happiness is won.” Here are 10 of the virtues he recommends—which, as modern research shows, do generally attract the good spirit.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C.

Whether he would recognize the virtue in our modern settings is hard to guess—who knows what he would say about the fear of being canceled on social media? But the question at hand is not the source of fear but whether courage—to act in the face of fear rather than give in to it—invites happiness. And the research suggests that it does: Scholars have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259778922_Biological_contributions_to_well-being_The_relationships_amongst_temperament_character_strengths_and_resilience">shown</a> that courage can lead to resilience after adversity, and resilience <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-07991-007">leads</a> to greater happiness.<br><br> <b>2.</b><b> </b><b>Temperance</b><br> By this, the philosopher means self-control in the face of one&#39;s appetites and base impulses. He would classify the hippie motto “If it feels good, do it!” as a recipe for misery. Modern researchers investigating self-control agree, but with a twist. Scholars writing in the <i>Journal of Personality</i> in 2017 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12322?casa_token=xFX0iDLDuiQAAAAA%3AfPL8aHFxVyoSerYzXI9M4aTRzOK-q_SMOPXPgMgGf9gzupRILN3uZvR-ZMakYB2hPOk1F9PnepszUL0">found</a> that as impulse control among college students increased over the course of a day, positive affect initially <i>fell</i> . As self-control kept rising, however, negative feelings decreased; happiness rose to its highest levels when self-control was at its highest as well. In other words, a little moderation isn&#39;t so good for well-being, but immoderate moderation may be great.<br><br> <b>3.</b><b> </b><b>Liberality</b><br> By this, the philosopher is referring not to politics (liberal <i>ism</i> ) but to money. Specifically, he recommends avoiding stinginess but without being profligate. In fact, evidence suggests that being a cheapskate influences your well-being. For example, three economists in 2014 set up an ultimatum-bargaining game in which participants had to split a certain amount of money: One participant offered a certain split; the other could say yes or no, but <i>no</i> meant that neither side got anything, so the offer of a lousy split could be answered with spite. The authors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108218">found</a> that physical stress levels were higher for both parties when the bargaining involved offered a split lower than 40 percent.<br><br> <b>4.</b><b> </b><b>Magnificence</b><br> Related to liberality is what Aristotle <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-nicomachean_ethics/1926/pb_LCL073.207.xml">calls</a> “magnificence,” according to which a person “will think how he can carry out his project most nobly and splendidly, rather than how much it will cost and how it can be done most cheaply.” He was not asserting here that the path to happiness is to buy an ostentatious yacht; rather, magnificence <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://philarchive.org/archive/ATHADO">means</a> giving to projects that benefit a large number of people. Today, we might call this “munificence”—to be as philanthropic as you reasonably can be. For this, the support is unambiguous: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.journalppw.com/index.php/jpsp/article/view/4535">Giving feels good</a> .<br><br> <b>5.</b><b> </b><b>Greatness of soul</b><br> A great-souled person, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0002.002/--modern-greatness-of-soul-in-hume-and-smith?rgn=main;view=fulltext">according</a> to Aristotle, acts like his close predecessor in ancient Greek philosophy, Socrates, who was a “being indifferent to good and bad fortune.” This requires being high-minded—not that you can&#39;t tell the difference between pleasant and unpleasant things, but that you are occupied by what is deeper and more meaningful in life than transitory pleasures and passing irritations. Indeed, research comparing the pursuit of pleasure versus of meaning among adolescents <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Linting-Zhang/publication/364186853_Pursuing_Pleasure_or_Meaning_A_Cross-Lagged_Analysis_of_Happiness_Motives_and_Well-being_in_Adolescents/links/6353a4656e0d367d91b4a52e/Pursuing-Pleasure-or-Meaning-A-Cross-Lagged-Analysis-of-Happiness-Motives-and-Well-being-in-Adolescents.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&amp;_sg%5B1%5D=started_experiment_milestone&amp;origin=journalDetail&amp;_rtd=e30%3D">shows</a> that the latter leads to greater happiness. In other words, get off social media and read, say, <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> .<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/03/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-anti-vaxxer-history/673522/">Read: To understand anti-vaxxers, consider Aristotle</a><br><br> <b>6.</b><b> </b><b>Gentleness</b><br> The virtue of gentleness refers to a propensity toward kindness and an ability to control your temper. The idea is that to be self-possessed in this way brings happiness. If true, then gentleness&#39;s opposite, aggression, should lower well-being by making it harder to manage one&#39;s own emotions. Researchers have tested this idea by asking people to think of someone they despise, and then either to imagine violent, malicious actions toward the person or to focus on a neutral thought (specifically, what they planned to do the following Wednesday—presumably <i>not</i> beat up the person in question). They <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260518812796?journalCode=jiva">found</a> that the aggressive thinkers began to brood over their fantasy assault and experienced lower well-being than the temperate crew as a result.<br><br> <b>7.</b><b> </b><b>Truthfulness about yourself</b><br> Aristotle put a great premium on honesty. He counseled against “pretense in the form of exaggeration” and boastfulness, but also against self-deprecation. You might say he recommended that we seek something like secure humility, through which we recognize ourselves and can show others who we are without either puffery or self-denigration. This tracks with the general work on humility, which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lisa-Ross-4/publication/357425333_Humility_Personality_and_Psychological_Functioning/links/6238bf09781d2e6df7ab6792/Humility-Personality-and-Psychological-Functioning.pdf">correlates</a> with lower levels of neuroticism and depression, as well as with a greater love of life. But it is also consistent with research <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760801999461">showing</a> that insecurity and excessive self-criticism are associated with anxiety and sadness.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/when-philosophy-becomes-therapy/380531/">Read: When philosophy becomes therapy</a><br><br> <b>8.</b><b> </b><b>公平</b><br>This is a word that gets a lot of attention in our modern debates. It commonly involves efforts to increase fairness and to redress past discrimination. And it is manifestly true that when people believe they are being treated unfairly, it <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797611417262">lowers their happiness</a> . But Aristotle meant something totally different. “The equitable man,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D10">wrote</a> the philosopher, “is one who by choice and habit … does not stand on his rights unduly, but is content to receive a smaller share although he has the law on his side.” He called this “a special kind of Justice.” For this proposition, I can find no specific empirical evidence. However, it is almost certainly related to the next virtue.<br><br> <b>9.</b><b> </b><b>Forgiveness</b><br>亚里士多德<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D11">写到</a>了考虑他人的美德。 To the contemporary ear, this sounds like politeness, or sensitivity to others&#39; feelings, but the philosopher was recommending something much trickier: forgiveness and forbearance toward others&#39; faults. The wisdom of this advice has a large modern literature to support it. Virtually every study of forgiveness <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://osf.io/8qzgw/">shows</a> that practicing it purposefully and letting go of grievances lowers depression and anxiety symptoms.<br><br> <b>10.</b><b> </b><b>Modesty</b><br> Modesty is often thought in the modern world to resemble humility. But Aristotle defined it as refraining from shameful (if tempting) behavior—and applied this even to private conduct. This conception of modesty makes it similar to temperance, except that instead of moderation in the face of base appetites, we should abstain completely from vices. He added a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0054:book=4:chapter=9&amp;highlight=modesty">caveat</a> , however: Modesty could be a virtue only if “a good man would be ashamed if he were to do so and so.” In other words, you have to believe a certain action is vicious in order to be virtuous in avoiding it. I personally have no moral qualms about liquor but don&#39;t drink myself, so by the Aristotelian standard, my teetotaling is not a virtue. Bearing this caveat in mind, this kind of modesty is indeed a happiness strategy: When people undertake what they consider <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1251560?casa_token=RE8pgoNigLIAAAAA:TcdOOZGDpCbkQbmv_wZgSuAGB-YrCj_FrXPAg7kR4I0-p9wP-Bn3iBHGcMVa1TMHqJvHiauz-0vU">moral acts</a> , they gain in happiness and even more so in sense of purpose; when they commit immoral acts, they experience the opposite.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">ristotle proposed these</span> happiness virtues more than two millennia ago, but I believe they provide a handy checklist today for living well. Here&#39;s an abbreviated list you might just want to put up on your fridge, or tape to the bottom of your computer screen.<br><br> 1. Name your fears and face them.<br> 2. Know your appetites and control them.<br> 3. Be neither a cheapskate nor a spendthrift.<br> 4. Give as generously as you can.<br> 5. Focus more on the transcendent; disregard the trivial.<br> 6. True strength is a controlled temper.<br> 7. Never lie, especially to yourself.<br> 8. Stop struggling for your fair share.<br> 9. Forgive others, and forbear their weaknesses.<br> 10. Define your morality; live up to it, even in private.<br><br> None of these rules is easy to follow. It is harder still to make them into habits.

Violence is, unfortunately and inevitably, central to feminist writing. Rape, domestic violence, racist violence, misogyny—these events indelibly shape women&#39;s lives, whether we experience them directly or adjust our behavior in fear of them.<br><br> Back then, I was convinced that such warnings were sometimes necessary to convey the seriousness of the topics at hand (the term <i>deeply problematic</i> appears a mortifying number of times under my byline). Even so, I chafed at the demands to add ever more trigger warnings, especially when the headline already made clear what the post was about. But warnings were becoming the norm in online feminist spaces, and four words at the top of a post—“Trigger Warning: Sexual Assault”—seemed like an easy accommodation to make for the sake of our community&#39;s well-being. We thought we were making the world just a little bit better. It didn&#39;t occur to me until much later that we might have been part of the problem.<br><br> The warnings quickly multiplied. When I wrote that a piece of conservative legislation was “so awful it made me want to throw up,” one commenter asked for an eating-disorder trigger warning. When I posted a link to a funny <em>BuzzFeed</em> photo compilation, a commenter said it needed a trigger warning because the pictures of cats attacking dogs looked like domestic violence. Sometimes I rolled my eyes; sometimes I responded, telling people to get a grip. Still, I told myself that the general principle—warn people before presenting material that might upset them—was a good one.<br><br> Trigger warnings migrated from feminist websites and blogs to college campuses and progressive groups. Often, they seemed more about emphasizing the upsetting nature of certain topics than about accommodating people who had experienced traumatic events. By 2013, they had become so pervasive—and so controversial—that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2013/12/trigger-warnings-from-the-feminist-blogosphere-to-shonda-rhimes-in-2013.html"><em>Slate</em> declared it</a> “The Year of the Trigger Warning.”<br><br> The issue only got more complicated from there. Around 2016, Richard Friedman, who ran the student mental-health program at Cornell for 22 years, started seeing the number of people seeking help each year increase by 10 or 15 percent. “Not just that,” he told me, “but the way young people were talking about upsetting events changed.” He described “this sense of being harmed by things that were unfamiliar and uncomfortable. The language that was being used seemed inflated relative to the actual harm that could be done. I mean, I was surprised—people were <i>very</i> upset about things that we would never have thought would be dangerous.” Some students, for instance, complained about lecturers who&#39;d made comments they disliked, or teachers whose beliefs contradicted their personal values.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/03/do-trigger-warnings-work/585871/">Read: The real problem with trigger warnings</a><br><br> To a certain degree, Friedman said, this represented a positive change. Mental illness was becoming less stigmatized than ever before, and seeking care was more common. But Friedman worried that students also saw themselves as fragile, and seemed to believe that coming into contact with offensive or challenging information was psychologically detrimental. In asking for more robust warnings about potentially upsetting classroom material, the students seemed to be saying: <i>This could hurt us, and this institution owes us protection from distress.</i><br><br> Have we inadvertently raised a generation that has fewer tools to manage hardship?<br><br> Trigger warnings were only one part of a larger shift. Complaints quickly entered the wider culture, and were applied to “toxic” workplaces and “problematic” colleagues; students decried the “potential trauma” caused by ideas and objected to the presence of some speakers and works of art.<br><br> My own doubts about all of this came, ironically, from reporting on trauma. I&#39;ve interviewed women around the world about the worst things human beings do to one another. I started to notice a concerning dissonance between what researchers understand about trauma and resilience, and the ways in which the concepts were being wielded in progressive institutions. And I began to question my own role in all of it.<br><br> Feminist writers were trying to make our little corner of the internet a gentler place, while also giving appropriate recognition to appallingly common female experiences that had been pushed into the shadows. To some extent, those efforts worked. But as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/02/the-tragic-mystery-of-teenage-anxiety/673076/">mental health of adolescent girls</a> and college students crumbles, and as activist organizations, including feminist ones, find themselves repeatedly embroiled in internecine debates over power and language, a question nags: In giving greater weight to claims of individual hurt and victimization, have we inadvertently raised a generation that has fewer tools to manage hardship and transform adversity into agency?<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Since my days</span> as a feminist blogger, mental health among teenagers has plummeted. From 2007 to 2019, the suicide rate for children ages 10 to 14 tripled; for girls in that age group, it nearly quadrupled. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/pdf/YRBS_Data-Summary-Trends_Report2023_508.pdf">2021 CDC report found</a> that 57 percent of female high-school students reported “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness,” up from 36 percent in 2011. Though the pandemic undoubtedly contributed to a crash in adolescent mental health, the downturn began well before COVID hit.<br><br> Teenage girls report troublingly high rates of sexual violence and bullying, as well as concern for their own physical safety at school. But it&#39;s not clear that their material circumstances have taken a plunge steep enough to explain their mental-health decline. The CDC study suggests that, over the past decade, bullying among high schoolers has actually decreased in certain respects. Today&#39;s teenagers are also less likely to drink or use illicit drugs than they were 10 years ago. And even before pandemic-relief funds slashed the child-poverty rate, the percentage of children living in poverty <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/09/record-drop-in-child-poverty.html">fell precipitously after 2012</a> . American public high schoolers are more likely to graduate than at any other time in our country&#39;s history, and girls are significantly more likely to graduate than boys.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/11/facebooks-dangerous-experiment-teen-girls/620767/">Jonathan Haidt: The dangerous experiment on teen girls</a><br><br> So what has changed for the worse for teenage girls since roughly 2010? The forces behind their deteriorating mental health are opaque and complex, but one big shift has been a decline in the time teenagers spend with their friends in person, dipping by 11 hours a week—a decline that began before the pandemic, but was badly exacerbated by it. Since 2014, the proportion of teens with smartphones has risen by 22 percent, and the proportion who say they use the internet “almost constantly” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2022/08/10/teens-social-media-and-technology-2022/">has doubled</a> . Part of the issue may be a social-media ecosystem that lets teens live within a bubble of like-minded peers and tends to privilege the loudest, most aggrieved voices; this kind of insularity can encourage teenagers to understand distressing experiences as traumatizing. “I think it&#39;s easier for them to artificially curate environments that are comfortable,” Shaili Jain, a physician and PTSD specialist, told me. “And I think that is backfiring. Because then when they&#39;re in a situation where they&#39;re not comfortable, it feels really alarming to them.”<br><br> Applying the language of trauma to an event changes the way we process it. That may be a good thing, allowing a person to face a moment that truly cleaved their life into a before and an after, and to seek help and begin healing. Or it may amplify feelings of helplessness and hopelessness, elevating those feelings above a sense of competence and control.<br><br> “We have this saying in the mental-health world: &#39;Perception is reality,&#39; ” Jain said. “So if someone is adamant that they felt something was traumatizing, that is their reality, and there&#39;s probably going to be mental-health consequences of that.”<br><br> Martin Seligman, the director of the Positive Psychology Center at the University of Pennsylvania, has spent the past 50 years researching resilience. One study he co-authored looked at the US Army, to see if there was a way to predict PTSD. Unsurprisingly, he and his fellow researchers found a link to the severity of the combat to which soldiers were exposed. But the preexisting disposition that soldiers brought to their battlefield experiences also mattered. “If you&#39;re a catastrophizer, in the worst 10 or 20 percent, you&#39;re more than three times as likely to come down with PTSD if you face severe combat,” Seligman told me. “And this is true at every level of severity of combat—the percentage goes down, but it&#39;s still about twice as high, even with mild combat or no obvious combat.”<br><br> In other words, a person&#39;s sense of themselves as either capable of persevering through hardship or unable to manage it can be self-fulfilling. “To the extent we overcome and cope with the adversities and traumas in our life, we develop more mastery, more resilience, more ability to fend off bad events in the future,” Seligman told me. “But conversely, to the extent that we have an ideology or a belief that when traumatic events occur, we are the helpless victims of them—that feeds on itself.”<br><br> Seligman also found that some soldiers who experienced severe trauma could not only survive, but actually turn their suffering into a source of strength. “About as many people who showed PTSD showed something called post-traumatic growth, which means they have an awful time during the event, but a year later they&#39;re stronger physically and psychologically than they were to begin with,” he said. But that empowering message has yet to take hold in society.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">So what would be</span> a more productive way to approach adversity? Friedman, the former Cornell mental-health coordinator, compares building resilience to physical exercise. “It&#39;s like any form of strength training,” he told me. “People have no hesitation about going to the gym and suffering, you know, muscle pain in the service of being stronger and looking a way that they want to look. And they wake up the next day and they say, &#39;Oh my God, that&#39;s so painful. I&#39;m so achy.&#39; That&#39;s not traumatic. And yet when you bring that to the emotional world, it&#39;s suddenly very adverse.”<br><br> The problem is that this idea—that to develop resilience, we must tough out hard situations—places a heavier burden on some people than others. Friedman pointed out that people who grew up under constant stress, perhaps owing to abuse, poverty, or food insecurity, may find that this stress is “erosive” to their ability to use those resilience muscles. The exercise metaphor rankled Michael Ungar, the director of the Resilience Research Centre at Dalhousie University, in Halifax, Canada. “Chronic exposure to a stressor like racism, misogyny, being constantly stigmatized or excluded, ableism—all of those factors do wear us down; they make us more susceptible to feelings that will be very overwhelming,” he told me. There are, after all, only so many times a person can convince themselves that they can persevere when it feels like everyone around them is telling them the opposite.<br><br> Creating the conditions where resilience is possible is as much a collective responsibility as an individual one.<br><br> Tyffani Monford Dent, a clinical psychologist and an author whose work focuses on sexual violence and racial trauma, calls this “the resiliency trap.” Black women in particular, she told me, have long been praised for their toughness and perseverance, but individual resiliency can&#39;t solve structural problems. From Dent&#39;s perspective, young people aren&#39;t rejecting the concept of inner strength; they are rejecting the demand that they navigate systemic injustice with individual grit alone. When they talk about harm and trauma, they aren&#39;t exhibiting weakness; they&#39;re saying, <i>Yes, I am vulnerable, and that&#39;s human</i> . These days, patients are being more “transparent about what they need to feel comfortable, to feel safe, to feel valued in this world,” she said. “Is that a bad thing?”<br><br> Most of the experts I spoke with were careful to distinguish between an individual student asking a professor for a specific accommodation to help them manage a past trauma, and a cultural inclination to avoid challenging or upsetting situations entirely. Thriving requires working through discomfort and hardship. But creating the conditions where that kind of resilience is possible is as much a collective responsibility as an individual one.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">If we want</span> to replace our culture of trauma with a culture of resilience, we&#39;ll have to relearn how to support one another—something we&#39;ve lost as our society has moved toward viewing “wellness” as an individual pursuit, a state of mind accessed via self-work. Retreating inward, and tying our identities to all of the ways in which we&#39;ve been hurt, may actually make our inner worlds harder places to inhabit.<br><br> “If everything is traumatic and we have no capacity to cope with these moments, what does that say about our capacity to cope when something more extreme happens?” Ungar said. “Resilience is partly about putting in place the resources for the next stressor.” Those resources have to be both internal and external. Social change is necessary if we want to improve well-being, but social change becomes possible only if our movements are made up of people who believe that the adversities they have faced are surmountable, that injustice does not have to be permanent, that the world can change for the better, and that they have the ability to make that change.<br><br> To help people build resilience, we need to provide material aid to meet basic needs. We need to repair broken community ties so fewer among us feel like they&#39;re struggling alone. And we need to encourage the cultivation of a sense of purpose beyond the self. We also know what stands in the way of resilience: avoiding difficult ideas and imperfect people, catastrophizing, isolating ourselves inside our own heads.<br><br> In my interviews with women who have experienced sexual violence, I try not to put the traumatic event at the center of our conversations. My aim instead is to learn as much as I can about them as people—their families, their work, their interests, what makes them happy, and where they feel the most themselves. And I always end our conversations by asking them to reflect on how far they&#39;ve come, and what they are proudest of.<br><br> That last question often elicits a powerful response. I started asking it because I hoped to let the women I met feel seen in full, beyond the worst things that had happened to them.<br><br> <small><em>This article appears in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09">September 2023</a> print edition with the headline “The Resilience Gap.”</em></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 09 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/trigger-warnings-feminism-teen-girls-mental-health/674759/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/trigger-warnings-feminism-teen-girls-mental-health/674759/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Welcome to the Age of ‘Foomscrolling’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The online frenzies that followed LK-99 and ChatGPT reveal a resurgent techno-optimism—and a shared longing for a new technology that will free us from human limits. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/yP3vUxT9CICFGM-CAF-gr3x3Fo4=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/lk_99_foomscroll_/original.jpg" alt="许多手机的插图，每部手机都显示一个漂浮的“LK99”肿块的图像" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊插图。资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure> I remember the first time I saw the floaty rock. It was the middle of night, and I was facing the insomniac&#39;s dilemma: to reach for the phone or not. I reached and opened Twitter—this was two weeks ago; the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-x-rebrand-juvenile-internet-style/674875/">new name</a> hadn&#39;t yet sunk in—on the theory that a scroll through my feed might achieve some hypnotic effect, creating an opening for sleep to take hold. That&#39;s when I saw the blurry <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sciencecast.org/casts/suc384jly50n">video</a> . In it, a scrap of material, small and misshapen like a pencil&#39;s broken lead tip, hovers mystically above a thick wafer of polished metal.<br><br> I scrolled right by. Despite following a fair number of “neat science thing” aggregators, in the wee hours I do not always thrill to edification. But a few minutes later, I saw the video again, and then a third time. I registered that this was not some didactic explanation of magnetism. This was news: The floaty rock was LK-99, a substance synthesized by a team of South Korean scientists, who believe it to be a room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductor.<br><br> I&#39;d like to report that the words <em>room-temperature ambient-pressure superconductor</em> were meaningful to me that night, but no. I puzzled over this phrase, like an ape taking stock of a monolith. I looked for contextual clues. I counted exclamation points. After a few minutes of internal resistance, I did some due diligence, by which I mean light and bleary-eyed Googling. Eventually, through some effort, I came to understand that LK-99 was potentially a holy-grail finding for materials scientists.<br><br> But not only materials scientists! This was not like the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/09/venus-life-phosphine-microbes/616342/">observation</a> of phosphine in Venus&#39;s atmosphere in 2020. Had that discovery held up—alas, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-signs-life-venus-are-fading-astronomers-downgrade-their-original-claims">it did not</a> —it would have strongly suggested the presence of life on that planet, an epochal finding but not one that would transform our world. The existence of a room-temperature superconductor would not simply be a nice new fact about nature. Rather, according to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://theconversation.com/room-temperature-superconductors-could-revolutionize-electronics-an-electrical-engineer-explains-the-materials-potential-201849">some</a> observers, it would mean we have access to a magical, all-purpose substance that can deliver us into a new technological age, where electricity flows through our world <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://theconversation.com/how-do-superconductors-work-a-physicist-explains-what-it-means-to-have-resistance-free-electricity-202308">without friction</a> , more computers are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thequantuminsider.com/2023/08/03/how-would-room-temperature-superconductors-change-quantum-computing/">quantum</a> , and trains, too, are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02481-0">floaty</a> .<br><br> Given LK-99&#39;s alleged import, a global race to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/lk99-superconductors-floating-rocks/674939/">reproduce the South Korean findings</a> was already under way, with much of the internet watching, excitedly. The specter of China getting there first added a layer of geopolitical intrigue. (I liked to imagine America&#39;s materials scientists huddled together, bracing for their Sputnik moment.) Meanwhile, the South Korean scientists were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/23820077/lk-99-superconductor-experts">reportedly</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2384782-room-temperature-superconductor-breakthrough-met-with-scepticism/?utm_source=rakuten&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=2116208:Skimlinks.com&amp;utm_content=10&amp;ranMID=47192&amp;ranEAID=TnL5HPStwNw&amp;ranSiteID=TnL5HPStwNw-w0iN0psrMFqpajHAWVaDMA">feuding</a> among themselves. And everyone could follow along on social media, marveling at each levitating rock the way that Twitch viewers marvel at a gamer&#39;s latest kill shot. If nothing else, it&#39;s a great way to pass time until a gleaming techno-utopia materializes around us.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/lk99-superconductors-floating-rocks/674939/">Read: A big week for floating rocks</a><br><br> What I&#39;m describing is, to be clear, the vibe surrounding LK-99 as I&#39;ve experienced it. Its closest analogue may be the frenzy that accompanied ChatGPT&#39;s release last November. Perhaps you remember: Late-pandemic malaise was wearing off; people were ready for shiny new things; and then, suddenly, those things appeared in the form of bots that could chat, code, and maybe even break up your marriage. Social-media feeds filled up with screenshots of their cleverest and most devious exploits <em>.</em><br><br> In the months after ChatGPT&#39;s release, some came to believe that a “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/foom">foom</a> ” was taking place. In the AI literature, a foom occurs when an AI&#39;s cascading self-improvements accelerate its own development until it becomes powerful beyond human comprehension. (The term is meant to evoke the sound of an explosive eruption.) The neat thing about this particular, supposed foom: It was being experienced in real time, at least by those who were sufficiently online. Technology was about to deliver us from suffering and scarcity, we were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://a16z.com/2023/06/06/ai-will-save-the-world/">told</a> , and you could see it all on Twitter. During the Trump presidency, the word <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doomscrolling-the-new-high-tech-way-to-slide-into-despair-11607640701"><em>doomscrolling</em></a> was coined to describe the habit of mainlining bad news through your smartphone. This was different; it had a positive valence. Call it foomscrolling.<br><br> Not every emerging technology will lead to foomscrolling. When its extraordinary powers can be demonstrated in some immediately recognizable visual form—two-tone chat screenshots, say, or floaty rocks—the behavior is more likely to occur. More important, to be eligible for foomscrolling, an emerging technology needs to be the kind of thing that could plausibly level up the species. (The Apollo missions would have led to endless foomscrolling; imagine 1 million reposts of the <em>Earthrise</em> photo captioned <span class="smallcaps">we are so back</span> .) GLP-1-receptor-activating drugs, like the one that&#39;s in Ozempic, provide an instructive counterexample. Despite constituting a long-hoped-for miracle—a weight-loss medicine that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/08/novo-nordisk-wegovy-cardiovascular-risk/">works</a> —they address only certain problems <em>.</em> No one is posting that these drugs will end up solving climate change; Ozempic won&#39;t prompt anyone to foomscroll.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/ozempic-pills-obesity-drugs-semaglutide/674541/">Read: Goodbye, Ozempic</a><br><br> In the case of AI, foomscrolling quickly curdled into something self-parodic: a cottage industry of AI influencers. They had paid-for blue checks and bios that carefully laundered their previous crypto enthusiasms. Initially, they were useful. The field was moving quickly and it was nice to have some aggregators of industry news, however credulous. But they soon overwhelmed the discourse with claims that this week&#39;s list of mind-melting breakthroughs was even more extensive than the last. It all started to seem a little sad, like LinkedIn.<br><br> Perhaps this is just the foomscrolling cycle. In recent days, the LK-99 fandom has been on the back foot; an aura of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-08/superconductor-lk-99-sample-may-be-available-in-weeks">deflationary realism</a> has begun to color the story. Some commentators are claiming that LK-99 is merely a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/alexkaplan0/status/1688734992682086400">ferromagnet</a> , and scientists have got the word out that even if the substance is indeed a room-temperature superconductor, the path to the future depicted in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-world-if">How Society Would Look meme</a> will be a long one. Replication claims are no longer topping my “For You” feed. Nuance and sobriety appear to be winning the day.<br><br> Peak superconductor foomscrolling may have already passed. But the cultural desire that fueled it—the hunger for a new tool that will lift us out of our human frailty and onto some smooth exponential trajectory to a shimmering and deathless future—that looks to be quite resilient. That collective longing may have been with us since Olduvai, in one form or another. The internet only magnifies it into a kind of searchlight. I imagine that its beam will soon find something else to lock onto, something new for the world&#39;s insomniacs to Google in the dead of night, in the hope that maybe, this time, the foom will be real.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 08 Aug 2023 20:47:40 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/foomscrolling-ai-chatgpt-lk-99-superconductor/674955/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/foomscrolling-ai-chatgpt-lk-99-superconductor/674955/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ones We Sent Away]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> I thought my mother was an only child.

It&#39;s the summer of 2021. My husband wanders into the kitchen and asks whether I&#39;ve seen<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/RoseUnwin/status/1429941550881124353">the post from the English theater director</a> that has been whipping around Twitter, the one featuring a photograph of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/15/stephen-unwin-son-joey-learning-disability">his nonverbal son</a> . I have not. I head up the stairs to my computer. “How will I find it?” I shout.<br><br> “You&#39;ll find it,” he tells me.<br><br> I do, within a matter of seconds: a picture of Joey Unwin, smiling gently for the camera, his bare calves and sandaled toes a few steps from an inlet by the sea. Perhaps you, too, have seen this photo? His father, Stephen, surely did not intend it to become the sensation it did—he wasn&#39;t being political, wasn&#39;t playing to the groundlings. “Joey is 25 today,” he wrote. “He&#39;s never said a word in his life, but has taught me so much more than I&#39;ve ever taught him.”<br><br> That this earnest, heartfelt tweet has been liked some 80,000 times and retweeted more than 2,600 is already striking. But even more so is the cascade of replies: scores of photographs from parents of non- and minimally verbal children from all over the world. Some of the kids are young and some are old; some hold pets and some sit on swings; some grin broadly and some affect a more serious, thoughtful air. One is proudly holding a tray of Yorkshire pudding he&#39;s baked. Another is spooning his mom on a picnic blanket.<br><br> I spend nearly an hour, just scrolling. I am only partway through when I realize my husband hasn&#39;t steered me toward this outpouring simply because it&#39;s an atypical Twitter moment, suffused with the sincere and the personal. It&#39;s because he recognizes that to me, the tweet and downrush of replies <i>are</i> personal.<br><br> He knows that I have an aunt whom no one speaks about and who herself barely speaks. She is, at the time of this tweet, 70 years old and living in a group home in upstate New York. I have met her just once. Before this very moment, in fact, I have forgotten she exists at all.<br><br> It is extraordinary what we hide from ourselves—and even more extraordinary that we once hid her, my mother&#39;s <i>sister</i> , and so many like her from everyone. Here are all these pictures of nonverbal children, so pulsingly alive—their parents describing their pleasures, their passions, their strengths and styles and tastes—while I know nothing, absolutely nothing, of my aunt&#39;s life at all. She is a thinning shadow, an aging ghost.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">When I first discovered</span> that my mother had a younger sister, I reacted as if I&#39;d been told about the existence of a new planet. This fact at once astonished me and made an eerie kind of sense, suddenly explaining the gravitational force that had invisibly arranged my family&#39;s movements and behaviors for years. Now I understood why my grandfather spent so many hours in retirement as a volunteer at the Westchester Association for Retarded Citizens. Now I understood my grandmother&#39;s annual trips to the local department store to buy Christmas presents, although we were Jewish. (At the time, my aunt lived in a group home where the residents were taken to church every Sunday.)<br><br> I now even understood, perhaps, the flickers of melancholy I would see in my grandmother, an otherwise buoyant and intrepid personality, charming and sly and full of wit.<br><br> And my mom: Where do you start with my mom? For almost two years, she had a sister. Then, at the age of 6 and a half, she watched as her only sibling, almost five years younger, was spirited away. It would be 40 years before she saw her again.<br><br> Strange how seldom we think about who our parents were as people before we made their acquaintance—all the dynamics and influences that shaped them, the defining traumas and triumphs of their early lives. Yet how are we to know them, really, if we don&#39;t? And show them compassion and understanding as they age?<br><br> I was 12 when I learned. My mother and I were sitting at the kitchen table when I wondered aloud what I&#39;d do if I ever had a disabled child. This provided her with an opening.<br><br> <i>Her name is Adele.</i><br><br> She had red hair, I was told. Weird: Who in our family had red hair? (Actually, my great-grandmother, but I knew her only as a white-haired battle-ax dedicated in equal measure to her soap operas and cigarettes.) She is <i>profoundly retarded</i> , my mother explained. There had been no language revolution back then. This was the proper descriptor, found in textbooks and doctors&#39; charts. My mother elaborated that the bones in Adele&#39;s head had knitted together far too early when she was a baby. So, a smaller brain. It was only when I met her 16 years later that I understood the physical implications of this: a markedly smaller head.<br><br> It was staggering to meet someone who looked just like my mother, but with red hair and a much smaller head.<br><br> My grandmother told my mother that she instantly knew something was different when Adele was born. Her cry wasn&#39;t like other babies&#39;. She was inconsolable, had to be carried everywhere. Her family doctor said nonsense, Adele was fine. For an entire year, he maintained that she was fine, even though, at the age of 1, she couldn&#39;t hold a bottle and didn&#39;t respond to the stimuli that other toddlers do. I can&#39;t imagine what this casual brush-off must have done to my grandmother, who knew, in some back cavern of her heart, that her daughter was not the same as other children. But it was 1952, the summer that Adele turned 1. What male doctor took a working-class woman without a college education seriously in 1952?<br><br> Only when my mother and her family went to the Catskills that same summer did a doctor finally offer a very different diagnosis. My grandmother had gone to see this local fellow not because Adele was sick, but because <i>she</i> was; Adele had merely come along. But whatever ailed my grandmother didn&#39;t capture this man&#39;s attention. Her daughter did. He took one look at her and demanded to know whether my aunt was getting the care she required.<br><br> What did he mean?<br><br> “That child is a microcephalic idiot.”<br><br> My grandmother told this story to my mother, word for word, more than four decades later.<br><br> In March of 1953, my grandparents took Adele, all of 21 months, to Willowbrook State School. It would be many years before I learned exactly what that name meant, years before I learned what kind of gothic mansion of horrors it was. And my mother, who didn&#39;t know how to explain what on earth had happened, began telling people that she was an only child.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is the fall</span> of 2021. My aunt lives in a uniquely unlovely part of upstate New York, a dreary grayscape of strip malls and Pizza Huts and liquor stores. But her group home is a snuggery of overstuffed furniture, flowers, family photos; the outside is framed by an actual white picket fence. It is precisely the kind of home you would hope that your aunt, abandoned to an institution through a cruel accident of timing and gravely misplaced ideas, would find herself in as she ages. When my mother and I arrive to see her, she is waiting for us at the door.<br><br> The drive to this house was 90 minutes from where my folks live in northern Westchester. Yet the car ride yielded just 29 minutes and 15 seconds of recorded conversation with my mother. This could partly be explained by the unfamiliar directions in her GPS, but still: Here she was, visiting the sister she hadn&#39;t seen since 1998—and then only twice before that, in 1993, shortly after her father died—and she had almost nothing to say about where we were headed or what the weather was like inside her head. She seemed far more interested in telling me about the necklaces she was making and selling to support Hadassah, one of her favorite charities. Whether this was out of anxiety or enthusiasm, I didn&#39;t know.<br><br> “Are you feeling nervous about seeing her?” I finally asked.<br><br> “No.”<br><br> “Really?为什么不？ <i>I&#39;m</i> nervous.”<br><br> “Why are you nervous?”<br><br> “Why are you <i>not</i> nervous?”<br><br> “Because I made peace with my separation from her many, many years ago.”<br><br> My grandparents, for their part, had visited my aunt almost every week, at least when she was young. Even after my grandmother moved to Florida, she made an effort to visit once a year. When I was in my late teens or early 20s, I remember my mother telling me that Adele never knew or understood who my grandmother was, not ever. This fact stuck with me—and hit me especially hard when I became a mother myself. As we were humming along the Taconic State Parkway, I reconfirmed: Adele didn&#39;t recognize her own mother?<br><br> “No,” she said. “She didn&#39;t know her. She didn&#39;t understand the concept of a mother.”<br><br> But when my mother last saw her sister, in 1998, it wasn&#39;t my grandmother who accompanied her. It was me. The whole trip had been at my instigation, just like this one. I&#39;d mentioned that I was interested in meeting my aunt, and my mother had stunned me then, just as she&#39;d stunned me now, by saying, “Why don&#39;t we go together?”<br><br> And what do I remember of that singular day? How uncharacteristically animated and affectionate my mother was when she saw Adele, for one thing. You could almost discern the outlines of the little girl she&#39;d been, the one who would circle Adele&#39;s crib and play a made-up game she called “Here, Baby.” Also, how petite my aunt was—4 foot 8, dumpling-shaped—and how slack the musculature was around her jaw, which may have had something to do with the fact that my aunt had no teeth. She had supposedly taken a medication that had made them decay, though there&#39;s really no way to know.<br><br> But what stayed with me most from that day—what I thought about for years afterward—were the needlepoint canvases marching along the walls in Adele&#39;s bedroom. My mother and I both gasped when we saw them. My mother, too, was an avid needlepointer in those years, undertaking almost comically ambitious projects—the Chagall windows, the Unicorn Tapestries. Adele&#39;s handiwork was simpler, cruder, but there it was, betokening the same passion, the same obsession.<br><br> One other thing: My mother and I discovered that day that Adele could carry a tune—and when she sang, she suddenly had hundreds of words at her disposal, not just <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i> , the only two words we heard her speak. Again, we were amazed. For years, my mother was a pianist and studied opera; her technical skills were impeccable, her sight-reading was impeccable, her ear was impeccable. She could pick up the telephone and tell you that the dial tone was a major third.<br><br> My mother couldn&#39;t get over it—the needlepoints, the singing.<br><br> I felt like I was staring at some kind of photonegative of a twin study.<br><br> So here we are, 23 years later, and Adele is greeting us at the door. She is wearing a bright-red sweater. There is my mother at the door. She, too, is wearing a bright-red sweater. Adele is wearing a long, chunky beaded necklace she has recently made at her day program. And my mother, like her sister, is wearing a long, chunky beaded necklace she has recently made—not at a day program, obviously, but for Hadassah. It turns out that Adele loves making necklaces and has whole drawers of them. As, lately, does my mother.<br><br> I have a picture of the two of them standing side by side that day. I cannot stop looking at it.<br><br> Carmen Ayala, Adele&#39;s extraordinary 79-year-old caretaker, has instructed Adele to say “Hello, Rona, I love you” to my mother, a gesture that&#39;s both sweet and awkward—Adele doesn&#39;t know my mother by sight, much less by name. Still, it catches my mother by surprise, not least because it suggests that her sister&#39;s vocabulary has expanded considerably since we last saw her, when she was living in a different group home. They embrace and take seats on the couch in the living room. We try, for a time, to ask Adele basic questions about her day, without much success, though when we ask if she knows any Christmas carols—the holiday is coming up—she sings “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” for us, and my mother replies in kind with “Silent Night.” Then Adele zones out, staring at her hands. She can spend hours staring at her hands.<br><br> My mother and I start to ask Carmen and her youngest child, Evelyn—she lives nearby and knows well all three residents in her parents&#39; home—the customary questions: How did Carmen get into this line of work? What is Adele&#39;s routine? How did Adele handle the transition to Carmen&#39;s house 22 years ago, after her previous caretaker retired? And although I&#39;m interested in the answers, I find myself growing restless, thoughts of that Twitter thread plucking at my consciousness. I finally blurt out: What is my aunt <i>like</i> ?<br><br> Evelyn replies first. “Very meticulous,” she says. “She needs things a certain way, and she will correct you the minute you do something wrong.”<br><br> I stare at my mother, who says nothing. I turn back to Evelyn and Carmen and prompt them. Such as?<br><br> Her clothes have to match, they say, down to the underwear. She keeps her bed pin-neat.<br><br> “She knows where everything is at,” Evelyn continues. “If we”—meaning her or any of her family members—“come here and we are washing a dish and we put it in the wrong place, she will tell us, <i>Nope</i> .”<br><br> I stare at my mother expectantly. Still nothing.<br><br> “Like, <i>That doesn&#39;t go there</i> ,” Evelyn explains.<br><br> At this point, my mother pipes up. “I don&#39;t let anyone else load the dishwasher.”<br><br>最后。<br><br> “That&#39;s Adele,” Evelyn says.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Arthur Miller&#39;s youngest son</span> , Daniel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/09/miller200709">was institutionalized</a> . He was born with Down syndrome in 1966 and sent to Southbury Training School, in Connecticut, when he was about 4 years old. Miller never once mentioned him in his memoir <i>Timebends</i> , and Miller&#39;s <i>New York Times</i> obituary said not one word about him, naming three children, rather than four.<br><br> Erik Erikson, the storied developmental psychologist, also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/08/22/reviews/990822.22edmundt.html">put his son with Down syndrome in an institution</a> . He and his wife, Joan, told their other three children that their brother died shortly after he was born in 1944. They eventually told all three the truth, but not at the same time. Their oldest son learned first. That must have been quite a secret to keep.<br><br> It is astonishing how many Americans have relations who were, at some point during the past century, sequestered from public view. They were warehoused, disappeared, roughly shorn from the family tree.<br><br> Pearl S. Buck, the Nobel Prize winner for literature and author of <i>The Good Earth</i> , institutionalized her 9-year-old daughter, Carol, likely in 1929. But Buck was different: She regularly visited her daughter, and 21 years later had the courage to write about her experience in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-child-who-never-grew-a-memoir-pearl-s-buck/9781504047968?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Child Who Never Grew</i></a> .<br><br> It is remarkable how many Americans have relations who were, at some point during the past century, sequestered from public view. They were warehoused, disappeared, roughly shorn from the family tree. “Delineated” is how the Georgetown disability-studies scholar Jennifer Natalya Fink puts it, meaning denied their proper place in their ancestral lineage.<br><br> With time, we would learn the terrible toll that institutionalization took on those individuals. But they weren&#39;t the only ones who paid a price, Fink argues. So did their parents, their siblings, future generations. In hiding our disabled relations, she writes in her book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/all-our-families-disability-lineage-and-the-future-of-kinship-jennifer-natalya-fink/9780807008133?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>All Our Families</i></a> , we as a culture came to view disability “as an individual trauma to a singular family, rather than a common, collective, and normal experience of all families.”<br><br> This is precisely what happened to Fink. When her daughter was diagnosed with autism at 2 and a half, Fink was devastated, despite her liberal politics and enlightened attitude toward neurodiversity. Then she realized that the only disabled person she knew about in her family was a relative who&#39;d been institutionalized in the early &#39;70s. This sent her on a journey to learn more about him—and in so doing, she discovered yet another disabled family member, in Scotland. Had she known far more about them—had they been an integral part of family discussions and photo albums (and, in the case of the American relative, family events)—she would have had a far richer, more expansive understanding of her ancestry; her own child&#39;s disability would have seemed like “part of the warp and woof of our lineage,” as she writes, rather than an exception.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/10/autisms-first-child/308227/">From the October 2010 issue: Autism&#39;s first child</a><br><br> It occurred to me that this may have been one of my unconscious motives in trying to get to know Adele at such a late stage of my own life, in addition to simple curiosity about a lost relative. It would be a minor act of restitution, of relineation. Without any malevolent intent, we&#39;d all colluded in one woman&#39;s erasure. And our entire family had been the poorer for it.<br><br> Mass institutionalization wasn&#39;t always the norm in the United States. During the colonial era, people with developmental and intellectual disabilities were integrated into most communities; in the early 1800s, with the advent of asylums and special schools, American educators hoped some could be cured and quickly returned to mainstream society.<br><br> But by the late 19th century, it became clear that intellectual disabilities couldn&#39;t be vanquished simply by sending people to the right schools or asylums, and once the eugenics movement captured the public&#39;s imagination, the fate of the country&#39;s intellectually and developmentally disabled was sealed. “Undesirables” and “defectives” weren&#39;t just institutionalized; they became the involuntary subjects of medical experiments, waking from mysterious surgeries to discover that they could no longer have children.<br><br> Cue the line from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/274us200"><i>Buck v. Bell</i> , the infamous 1927 Supreme Court case</a> that upheld a Virginia statute permitting the sterilization of the so-called intellectually unfit: “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”<br><br> Then the postwar era came along, with its apron-clad mothers and gray-flanneled fathers and all-around emphasis on a certain species of Americanness, a certain norm. “I&#39;m speaking in huge generalities here,” says Kim E. Nielsen, the author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/a-disability-history-of-the-united-states-kim-e-nielsen/9780807022047?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>A Disability History of the United States</i></a> , “but I think that push for social conformity exacerbated the incredible shame folks had about family members with intellectual and physical disabilities.” Institutionalizing such family members often became the most attractive—or viable—option. The stigma associated with having a different sort of child was too great; too often, schools wouldn&#39;t have them, state-subsidized therapies weren&#39;t available to them, and churches wouldn&#39;t come to their aid. “There were no support structures at all,” Nielsen told me. “It was almost the opposite. There were <i>anti</i> -support structures.”<br><br> My aunt was born in that postwar period. But I don&#39;t think my grandparents were capitulating to social pressure when they institutionalized Adele. They were simply listening to the advice of their doctors, authoritative men with white coats and granite faces who told them there was no point in keeping their daughter at home. According to my mother, my grandparents ferried Adele from one specialist to another, each declaring that she would never walk, never talk, never outgrow her diapers.<br><br> Which raised a question, on further reflection: Did my aunt&#39;s condition have a name? As we were driving along, my mother told me she didn&#39;t know; Adele had never had genetic testing.<br><br>真的吗？我问。 Even now? In the 2020s?<br><br> Really.<br><br> My grandparents are no longer with us. I know little of what they were told or how they felt when they were advised to send their second child away. But I imagine the script sounded similar to what a physician told Pearl S. Buck when she took Carol to the Mayo Clinic. “This child will be a burden on you all your life,” he said, according to Buck&#39;s memoir. “Do not let her absorb you. Find a place where she can be happy and leave her there and live your own life.” She did as she was told. But it violated every ounce of her maternal intuition. “Perhaps the best way to put it,” she wrote, “is that I felt as though I were bleeding inwardly and desperately.”<br><br> “The parents who institutionalized their children—they too are survivors of institutionalization and victims of it,” Fink told me. “They were broken by this. It was not presented as a choice, for the most part. And even when it was, the medical establishment made it seem like institutionalization was the <i>best</i> choice.”<br><br> That applied to my grandmother, a tower of resilience, a woman who survived her father&#39;s suicide, a brutal knife attack by a madman in a public restroom, and breast cancer at a relatively young age. She, like Buck, bled inwardly and desperately, in the most literal sense, developing an ulcer when my mom was 11 or 12. “Before Grandma died, she started talking about Adele, and for the first time that I can remember, she admitted that she felt terrible institutionalizing her,” my mother told me as we drove. “When I reminded her that if she had not institutionalized her, nobody in the family would&#39;ve had a normal life, she said, &#39;Yes, but she would&#39;ve been with people who loved her.&#39; ”<br><br> One of the beneficiaries of that so-called normal life was, ostensibly, my mother. In his magisterial <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/far-from-the-tree-parents-children-and-the-search-for-identity-andrew-solomon/9780743236720?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Far From the Tree</i></a> , the writer Andrew Solomon notes that the most commonly cited rationale for institutionalization in those years was that neurotypical siblings would suffer—from shame, from attention starvation—if their disabled siblings were kept at home.<br><br> But it&#39;s more complicated than that, isn&#39;t it? My mother has never in her life uttered a cross word about her parents&#39; decision, and she&#39;s hardly the sort to play the victim—she may have been trained as an opera singer, but she&#39;s the least divalike person I know. Yet when I asked her what it was like when Adele left the house, she reflexively confirmed Fink&#39;s hypothesis: She suffered. “It was like I lost an arm or a leg,” she said.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/phantom-twin/">his second memoir,</a></span> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/phantom-twin/"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/phantom-twin/"><i>Twin</i></a> , the composer and pianist Allen Shawn writes about the trauma of losing his twin sister, Mary, to an institution when they were 8 years old. He describes her absence as “an unmourned death,” which closely matches my mother&#39;s experience; he writes, too, that when she was sent away, it felt to him like a form of punishment, “an expulsion, an exile,” which my mother has also recounted in melancholy detail.<br><br> But what most captured my attention was Shawn&#39;s analysis of how his sister affected his personality. “From an early age,” he writes, “I intuited that there were tensions surrounding Mary and instinctively took it upon myself to continue to be the easier child and avoid worrying my parents.”<br><br> That was my mother: the peerless good girl. High-achieving, rule-abiding, perfection-seeking. She skipped a grade. Until junior high, she chose practicing piano over playing with friends. In high school, she sang with the all-city chorus at Carnegie Hall.<br><br> Did she ever rebel? I asked her.<br><br> “Nah,” she said. “I was a goody-goody.”<br><br> To this day, my mother is the good girl. Buttoned-up, always reasonable, always in control. When hotter tempers flare around her, she defaults to a cool 66 degrees.<br><br> My mother was thrilled when her parents brought her newborn sister home. She remembers Adele scooching to different corners of her playpen to follow her as she ran in circles around it. She remembers sitting on the kitchen counter and watching my grandmother prepare bottles. She remembers my grandmother asking her to go on tiptoe into my grandparents&#39; room to see if Adele was asleep in her crib or still fussing. When my grandmother and grandfather began their frantic circuit of New York City&#39;s specialists, wondering what could be done to help Adele, my mother had no clue that anything was the matter. Why would she? She was 6 years old. She&#39;d always wanted a sibling and now she&#39;d been gifted one. Adele was marvelous. Adele was perfect. Adele was her sister.<br><br> When my grandparents left to take Adele to Willowbrook in March of 1953, they had no idea what to tell my mother, settling eventually on the story that they were taking her sister to “walking school.” My mom thought little of it. But for weeks, months, years, she kept expecting Adele to return. <i>When is she coming back?</i> she would regularly ask. <i>We don&#39;t know</i> , my grandparents would reply.<br><br> At 8, my mother one day had a sudden meltdown—became unstrung, hysterical—and demanded much more loudly to know when Adele would be returning, pointing out that it was taking her an awfully long time to learn how to walk. That was the first time she saw my grandmother cry.<br><br> <i>I don&#39;t know</i> , she still answered.<br><br> That same year, my great-grandmother, recently widowed, moved in with my grandparents. More specifically, she moved into my mother&#39;s room, into the twin bed that Adele was supposed to occupy. My mother was furious about having to move her things, furious that she was losing her privacy, furious that her grandmother was moving into Adele&#39;s bed. (Now she modified the question she regularly asked her parents: <i>Where will Adele sleep when she comes home?</i> And they would always reply: <i>We&#39;ll figure it out when the time comes.</i> ) Adele never did come home, and my grandparents would never try to have another child to fill that bed. My great-grandmother was there to stay.<br><br> My great-grandmother: Lord. She meant well, I suppose. But she had only a grade-school education and all the subtlety of a flyswatter. When my mother was 13, my great-grandmother told her that she had to be good enough for two children, smart enough for two children. “She kept emphasizing that my parents had lost a child,” my mother said. The pressure was awful.<br><br> By 13, of course, my mother had already figured out that something was different about her sister—and that Adele was never coming home. She&#39;d heard the neighborhood kids whisper. One cruelly declared she&#39;d heard Adele was in reform school. Consciously or unconsciously, my mother began handling the situation in her own way, volunteering in classrooms for kids with intellectual disabilities. Two liked her so much that she started tutoring them privately.<br><br> Yet throughout my mother&#39;s childhood, my grandparents never once invited her to come with them to visit Adele. At first she was told no children were allowed; by the time her parents did ask her to join them, my mother, at that point an adult with children of her own, said no. She felt too raw, too tender about it. She didn&#39;t want to unloose a current of ancient hurts. My grandparents never raised it again.<br><br> I asked if she ever sat around and just thought about Adele. “Oh, sure,” she told me. “I wonder what she would&#39;ve been like if she weren&#39;t disabled. I wonder what kind of relationship we would&#39;ve had. I wonder whether I would&#39;ve had nieces and nephews. Whether she would&#39;ve had a husband, whether she would&#39;ve had a good marriage, whether we would&#39;ve been close, whether we would&#39;ve lived near each other …”<br><br> And what ran through her mind, I asked, when she set eyes on Adele for the first time in 40 years, back in 1993? “I got deprived of having a real sibling,” she said.<br><br> For weeks afterward, I thought long and hard about this particular regret. Because my aunt <i>was</i> a real sibling. But no one of my mother&#39;s generation was told to think this way. The disabled were dramatically underestimated and therefore criminally undercultivated: hidden in institutions, treated interchangeably, decanted of all humanity—spectral figures at best, relegated to the margins of society and memory. Even their closest family members were trained to forget them. After my mother came home from that visit, she scribbled six pages of impressions titled “I Have a Sister.” As if she were finally allowing it to register. To acknowledge this clandestine part of herself.<br><br> It is painful, almost too painful, to think about how differently my mother might have felt—how different her life and my aunt&#39;s might have been—if they had been born today.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s June of 2022.</span> I&#39;ve just asked Adele how many pictures are sitting in front of me. My mother is skeptical. I ask again. “How many pictures? One …”<br><br> “One,” she repeats.<br><br> “Two …” I say.<br><br> “Two, three,” she finishes.<br><br> I look triumphantly at my mother.<br><br> My mother is now somewhere between skeptical and delighted. She tries herself. “How many fingers?” she asks, holding up her hand.<br><br> “Five.”<br><br> There are five.<br><br> “She understands,” I tell my mother.<br><br> “Well, either that or she memorized it.”<br><br> I show Adele two fingers and ask how many.<br><br> “Two.”<br><br> There&#39;s a reason my mother is surprised. When we visited Adele in 1998, she barely spoke at all, much less showed that she had a notional sense of quantity. (She will today show us that she can count to 12 before she starts skipping around.) She wasn&#39;t agitated back then when we saw her, not exactly. But she wasn&#39;t relaxed. A transfixing report about Adele, sent to my mother not that long ago, suggests that one of the reasons she may be more alert now—and possesses a larger vocabulary—is because she&#39;s on a better, less sedating regimen of medications.<br><br> But there&#39;s another reason, I think, for my mother&#39;s skepticism. Her whole life, she&#39;d been given to understand that Adele&#39;s condition was fixed—that her sister was consigned to a life without any deepening or growth. As she put it to me during that first car ride: “There would be no reason for her to get any more cognizant or any smarter.” That&#39;s how everyone thought about disability back in my mother&#39;s day. It&#39;s my own generation—and the ones following—that came to see the brain as a miracle of plasticity, teachable and retrainable right into old age.<br><br> Yet Adele exceeded the expectations of all the specialists who gave dire predictions to my grandparents. She did learn to talk. She did become toilet-trained. Not only can she walk, but she dances a mean salsa, which she shows us now—and where she gets her sense of rhythm, I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s great. (I personally dance like Elaine on <i>Seinfeld</i> .) Carmen and her husband, Juan, both from Puerto Rico, often play Latin music, and Adele jumps right in, with one hand on her belly and the other high and outward-facing, as if on the shoulder of an imaginary partner, all while shaking her hips and waggling her rear. Juan, whom she calls “Daddy,” often joins her.<br><br> Adele gently rests her head on my mother&#39;s shoulder and keeps it there. My mother, ordinarily a coil of discipline, looks so blissed out, so happy.<br><br> I ask Carmen (whom she calls “Mommy”) whether Adele knows any Spanish, given that she and Juan speak it around the house. She says yes.<br><br> “ <i>¡Mamá!</i> ” Carmen calls to Adele.<br><br> “What?”<br><br> “ <i>¿Tú quieres a papi?</i> ” Do you love Daddy?<br><br> “What?”<br><br> “ <i>¿Tú quieres mucho a papi?</i> ” Do you love Daddy a lot?<br><br> Adele nods emphatically.<br><br> “How much?” Carmen asks, switching to English. “How much you love Daddy? Let me see how much.”<br><br> “Four dollars.”<br><br> “Four dollars!” Carmen exclaims. “Oh my God.” Juan cracks up.<br><br> This kind of confusion is also typical of what we see in Adele throughout this, our second visit to the Ayala home. The report sent to my mother, which contains assessments of the institutions she&#39;s inhabited and the day programs she&#39;s attended throughout her life, continually notes that she has trouble grasping concepts—that she “can name various objects, but become[s] confused when long sentences are used.” It adds that she “often mumbles and is difficult to understand. If she does not understand what is being said to her, she simply says, &#39;Yeah.&#39; ”<br><br> And we do have a hard time understanding her, and she does say “Yeah” to a number of our basic questions about her day, which can make getting to know her frustrating. But not when she becomes animated about things she likes. Summer is approaching, for instance, which means Adele will shortly be going to camp. She adores camp. I ask what she does there. “A game! And color.” Coloring, she means.<br><br> Other things Adele loves: <i>Care Bears</i> , stuffed animals, blingy baseball hats, shopping at Walmart, wearing perfume, preparing Juan&#39;s nightclothes, tucking in her roommate each night.<br><br> Camp is the only time Carmen truly gets a break from caring for Adele and her two housemates—“I don&#39;t like to leave them with nobody,” she explains to me—and even when she does go out, she generally doesn&#39;t travel very far.<br><br> I stare at Carmen, now 80, and realize I already live in fear of the moment when she won&#39;t be able to look after my aunt anymore. She has pulmonary hypertension and requires oxygen every night, and sometimes during the day. Yet she still cares for her three charges, whose pictures populate her photo albums right alongside those of her biological kids and grandkids. (My favorite: Adele standing next to a life-size Angry Bird.) Every day, she helps bathe them; makes their beds; shops for them; manages their various doctor appointments; takes them on outings; and, with Juan, prepares their breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Five out of seven days, this means rising at 5 am In my aunt&#39;s specific case, it means doing her hair each morning just the way she likes, putting in her earrings, and pureeing her food—Adele refuses to wear her dentures.<br><br> “When I was raising my kids, you know—it&#39;s something that you miss,” Carmen explains.<br><br> Adele&#39;s transition to the Ayala home wasn&#39;t easy. Change is hard for her; she likes order. And when she arrived at Carmen&#39;s house 23 years ago, she had scabies, which—in addition to raising questions about how well cared for she&#39;d been in her previous home—meant that Carmen had to throw out everything she owned: her beloved stuffed animals, her clothes, her sheets. The adjustment became that much more traumatic; now my aunt truly had nothing. She threw tantrums. She once called Carmen “the B-word” (as Carmen puts it). Carmen phoned the home liaison. “And she says, &#39;Carmen, easy. She&#39;s a very good lady.&#39; ”<br><br> I ask how she earned my aunt&#39;s trust. “I used to sit down with her and, you know, I used to talk to her a lot,” she says. “Talking, talking, talking to her. I&#39;m telling her, &#39;Come here, help me with this&#39; or &#39;Help me with that.&#39; ”<br><br> Now, Carmen says, Adele can recite all of her grandchildren&#39;s names and knows them by sight. She demonstrates, asking Adele to name everyone in her son Edgar&#39;s family. “JJ, Lucas, Janet, Jessica …” Adele says. Neither of her housemates can do this. “It doesn&#39;t matter how long she hasn&#39;t seen them,” Evelyn, Carmen&#39;s daughter, later tells me. “She knows who they are. She has a memory that she&#39;ll meet somebody and she&#39;ll remember their name. That&#39;s her gift.”<br><br> Her gift? I am incredulous when I hear this. I keep thinking about what I&#39;ve been told my whole adult life: that Adele never even recognized her own mother, at least as far as my mom understood it. Was this some kind of misapprehension? Maybe Adele <i>had</i> known my grandmother? Or maybe she hadn&#39;t, but only because she&#39;d been so aggressively narcotized?<br><br> As Carmen is talking with us, Adele gently rests her head on my mother&#39;s shoulder and keeps it there. My mother, ordinarily a coil of discipline and control (always correct, always the good girl), looks so blissed out, so happy. When our visit is over, she tells me that this was her favorite part, Adele burrowing into her—and that she&#39;s already thinking about when she can next see her again.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">November 22, 1977:</span> <i>On medication due to head banging behaviors … She stares off into space, fixates on her hands, or hair and has the compulsion to smell people&#39;s hair</i> (Wassaic State School, Amenia, New York).<br><br> This is from the report sent to my mother, the one containing assessments of Adele from the different institutions she&#39;s lived in and day programs she&#39;s been a part of. I had a closer look at it maybe a week or two after our second visit.<br><br> February 11, 1986: <i>(Psychotropic) Meds originally prescribed for screaming, hitting others, hitting self, extreme irritability</i> (case-worker report from a day-treatment program, Ulster County, New York). It is noted that she is taking 150 milligrams daily of Mellaril, a first-generation antipsychotic.<br><br> October 1991: <i>Outbursts look like psychosis … yell[s] out statements such as “Adele. Stop that!” or … “Leave me alone!”</i> (summary of a report from a day program, Kingston, New York).<br><br> Late 2006: <i>Psychiatry providers now recognize that there is psychosis present and Zyprexa is effectively treating this</i> (summary of various evaluations).<br><br> The report is eight pages long. But you get the idea. The dear woman who nestled into my mother&#39;s shoulder, waved at us until our car pulled out of sight, and recently wandered into Carmen&#39;s room when she intuited that something was the matter (Carmen was unwell) also had an unremitting history, until not that long ago, of violent outbursts, self-harm, and psychosis.<br><br> Far be it from me to quarrel with those who evaluated her, including the esteemed men in white coats. But “psychosis” seemed, when I read this report, like an incomplete story, carrying with it the stench of laziness and <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest</i> reductivism— <i>This person is difficult; let&#39;s sedate her</i> .<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/autism-first-diagnosis-donald-triplett/674453/">John Donvan and Caren Zucker: What we learned from autism&#39;s first child</a><br><br> I could have been totally wrong. Based on this report, Adele certainly seemed, at times, to pose a danger to herself and others. But I found it curious that nowhere in this document did it say anything about a behavior that even my untrained eye detected immediately during our visits: My aunt does tons of harmless stimming, the repetitive motions frequently associated with autism. (She is especially fond of wiggling her fingers in front of her eyes.) In all the years of observational data about her—at least from what I saw here—there wasn&#39;t a word about this, or the word <i>autism</i> itself. And autistic individuals, when frustrated or confronted with change or responding to excessive stimuli, can sometimes behave aggressively—or in ways that could be misread as psychotic.<br><br> And so, for that matter, can traumatized people.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is December of 2022</span> . A visiting nurse, Emane, whom Adele calls Batman, is swabbing Adele&#39;s cheek. My aunt is being sweet and obedient; Emane, tender yet efficient. The sample will go to a lab in Marshfield, Wisconsin, that will sequence Adele&#39;s genes.<br><br> Wendy Chung, the Boston Children&#39;s Hospital geneticist with whom my mother and I are working, has warned us that there is only a one-in-three chance that Adele&#39;s genetic test will come back with a condition or syndrome that has an actual name. But Chung has told me, as have a number of other experts, that there&#39;s no other way to know for sure what Adele has. Dozens of things can cause microcephaly.<br><br> “But if you can find out exactly what she has,” Chung says, “then you can find a family—”<br><br> “—with a child who has it now,” I say.<br><br> Exactly, she says. And then I can compare how children with this syndrome fare today, versus how they fared in the 1950s.<br><br> My mother, Adele&#39;s medical proxy, had to sign the forms to do this genetic test. My aunt was incapable of giving her own consent. And it occurs to me, as I sit here watching her so docilely allow Emane to rake her cheek with a Q-tip, that Adele has never been able to give her consent for anything, good or bad, her whole life. Not for the medications she has taken, which may or may not have helped her; not for mammograms, which, given our family history, are indisputably a good idea. Not for any of the things that were done to her while she was institutionalized until the age of 28; not for a trip to the mall to get ice cream.<br><br> She cannot consent to this profile, I suddenly realize with some alarm.<br><br> I spend quite a few weeks fretting about this. Only after speaking with Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, a renowned bioethicist and disability scholar, do I understand exactly why this is so. The last thing I want to do is hurt Adele. So <i>not</i> writing about her would be consistent with this wish, in keeping with the benevolent spirit of the Hippocratic oath: I&#39;d be doing no harm. Whereas I am trying to do good, a much riskier proposition. “The problem with trying to do good,” she tells me, “is you don&#39;t know how it&#39;s going to come out.”<br><br> “I don&#39;t have a <i>legal</i> right to know anything about my relatives who were disappeared,” says Jennifer Natalya Fink, who faced a similar ethical predicament when she wrote <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/all-our-families-disability-lineage-and-the-future-of-kinship-jennifer-natalya-fink/9780807008133?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>All Our Families</i></a> . “But I have a <i>moral</i> right. And it&#39;s a moral wrong, what was done to them. For us not to keep perpetuating those wrongs, we have to integrate knowledge of our disabled forebears.”<br><br> There remains a school of thought that privileges the privacy of people with intellectual disabilities above all else, particularly when it comes to something as delicate as divulging their medical history. And this argument may be right. I don&#39;t know. But I ultimately decide, in the weeks after that swab, that integrating Adele means saying her name, and that understanding Adele—and her needs, and her potential, and whether she&#39;s been treated with the appropriate care and dignity her whole life—means knowing and naming whatever syndrome she has. To refrain from doing so would simply mean more erasure. Worse: It would imply that her condition is shameful, and there&#39;s been more than enough of that in my family.<br><br> To hell with shame.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">I don&#39;t know</span> why this is, but I keep coming back to my mother&#39;s deep desire for order. I had always assumed, I suppose, that it was a response to early trauma—a natural reaction to helplessly watching her sister get shipped away. But then I spent time with Adele and discovered that she shared the same trait, as if it were inscribed in the family genes.<br><br> I mention this one day to Evelyn, Carmen&#39;s daughter, on the phone. She mulls it over. “But maybe it comes from the same place in Adele,” she says. “She was taken from her mother. She&#39;s been controlled <i>her whole life</i> . You don&#39;t know what she&#39;s gone through, where she&#39;s been.”<br><br> I sit in chastened silence for several seconds. She is absolutely right. Of course it could come from the same place. Adele no doubt also experienced savage trauma in her life. It was just less legible, because she had no clear way to convey it. For all I know, my aunt is a <i>matryoshka</i> doll of buried pain.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In January of 1972,</span> Michael Wilkins met in a Staten Island diner with a young television journalist named Geraldo Rivera and discreetly handed him a key. It opened the doors to Building No. 6 at Willowbrook State School, from which Wilkins, a doctor, had recently been fired. He&#39;d been encouraging the parents of the children in that ward—and others, from the sound of it—to organize for better living conditions. The administration didn&#39;t like that very much.<br><br> In February of that year, Rivera&#39;s half-hour exposé, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abc7ny.com/willowbrook-geraldo-rivera-staten-island-bill-ritter/11575075/">Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace</a> ,” aired on WABC-TV. It was sickening. To this day, it remains one of the most powerful testaments to the horrors and moral degeneracy of institutionalization. You can easily find it on YouTube.<br><br> Rivera was by no means the first to visit Willowbrook. Robert F. Kennedy had toured the place in 1965 and called it “a snake pit.” But because Rivera suddenly had access to one of the ghastliest dorms on campus, he and his camera crew could storm the premises unannounced. What he found—and what his viewers saw—was the kind of suffering one associates with early-Renaissance depictions of hell. The room was dark and bare. The children were naked, wailing, and rocking on the floor. Some were caked in their own feces. “How can I tell you about the way it smelled?” Rivera asked. “It smelled of filth, it smelled of disease, and it smelled of death.” He went on to interview Wilkins, who made it clear that Willowbrook wasn&#39;t a “school” at all. “Their life is just hours and hours of endless nothing to do,” he said of the patients, adding that 100 percent of them contracted hepatitis within the first six months of moving in.<br><br> Actually, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leahrosenbaum/2020/06/12/willowbrook-scandal-hepatitis-experiments-hideous-truths-of-testing-vaccines-on-humans/?sh=23070f41279c">doctors were deliberately giving some of those children hepatitis</a> . Even into the 1970s, the intellectually disabled were the subjects of government-funded medical experiments.<br><br> “Trauma is severe,” Wilkins told Rivera, “because these patients are left together on a ward—70 retarded people, basically unattended, fighting for a small scrap of paper on the floor to play with, fighting for the attention of the attendants.”<br><br> “Can the children be trained?” Rivera asked at one point.<br><br> “Yes,” the doctor said. “Every child can be trained. There&#39;s no effort. We don&#39;t know what these kids are capable of doing.”<br><br> This was where my aunt spent the formative period of her youth, from the time she was a toddler until she was 12 or 13 years old. Though she left eight years before Rivera and his crew arrived, it&#39;s hard to imagine that the conditions were any better in her day. As Kim E. Nielsen writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/a-disability-history-of-the-united-states-kim-e-nielsen/9780807022047?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>A Disability History of the United States</i></a> , World War II was devastating for these institutions, which were hardly exemplary to begin with. The young men who worked there were shipped off to war, and most of the other employees found better-paying jobs and superior conditions in defense plants. These state facilities remained dreadfully poor-paying and understaffed from then on, their budgets forever in governors&#39; crosshairs.<br><br> “It was horrible,” Diana McCourt told me. She placed her daughter, Nina, born with severe autism, in Willowbrook in 1971. “She always smelled of urine. Everything smelled of urine. It&#39;s like it was in the bricks and mortar.”<br><br> Diana and her husband, Malachy McCourt—the memoirist, actor, radio host, and famous New York pub owner—soon became outspoken activists and got involved in a class-action lawsuit against the institution. “I can&#39;t quite tell you how much they didn&#39;t want us to witness what was going on inside,” Malachy told me. When children were presented to their parents, they were taken to the entranceway of their dorm after being hastily dressed by attendants. “The clothes were never her clothes,” Diana said. “She was wearing whatever they could find in the pile.”<br><br> But most chilling of all was an offhand comment Diana made about the reports she received about her daughter. They were vague, she said, or demonstrably untrue, or maddeningly pedestrian—that she&#39;d just gone to see the dentist, for instance. “The dentist,” Diana said, “was notorious for pulling people&#39;s teeth.”<br><br> Wait, I said. Repeat that?<br><br> “Instead of dental care, they pulled the teeth out.”<br><br> Is <i>that</i> how my aunt lost her teeth?<br><br> Rivera noted in his special that the wards contained no toothbrushes that he could see.<br><br> I&#39;d like to think that Adele&#39;s life improved when she went to Wassaic State School in 1964. But New York produced, at that moment in time, nothing but hellholes. (Rivera also visited Letchworth Village in his documentary, an institution so awful that the McCourts steered clear of it, opting for Willowbrook instead.) Wassaic, too, had a reputation for being grim. At least one note from the report sent to my mother indicated that my aunt was very keen on leaving it. The date was January 18, 1980. Adele was by then 28 years old and had enough of a vocabulary to get her point across. “Clothes and suitcase?” she asked one of the clinicians.<br><br> Even when my aunt finally transferred to residential care, living in private homes and attending local programs in upstate New York, her treatment, until the &#39;90s, seemed less than ideal. In March of 1980, my aunt attended a day facility in an old factory that still had very loud electric and pneumatic machines, and the result was disastrous—“agitated, violent outbursts.” She was frequently taken to the “Quiet Room,” quilted with actual padded walls, where the staff would physically restrain her. This practice, the report notes, is no longer used in New York.<br><br> It took seven years and nine months before her team realized that the industrial cacophony was causing a good deal of the problem.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is mid-December 2022.</span> Adele&#39;s genetic test has come back.<br><br> Her disorder does indeed have a name. Remarkably, it would not have had a name if we&#39;d tested her just four years ago. But in 2020, a group of 50-plus researchers announced their discovery of Coffin-Siris syndrome 12, the “12” signifying a rare subtype within an already rare disorder. At the time they made this discovery, they could identify just 12 people in the world whose intellectual disability was caused by a mutation in this particular gene. Since then, says Scott Barish, the lead author of the paper announcing the finding, the number has climbed to somewhere between 30 and 50. So now, with my aunt, it&#39;s that number plus one.<br><br> I immediately join a Facebook group for people with Coffin-Siris syndrome. I find only a few parents with children who have the same subtype as Adele. One couple lives in Moscow; another, Italy. But as soon as I post something about my aunt, there&#39;s a flurry of replies from mothers and fathers of kids across the Coffin-Siris spectrum, most of them focused on the same thing: Adele&#39;s age. Seventy-one! How thrilling that someone with Coffin-Siris syndrome could live that long! They want to know all about her, and what kind of health she is in. (Robust, I reply.)<br><br> Because Coffin-Siris syndrome, first described in 1970, can be caused by mutations in any one of a variety of genes, its manifestations vary. As a rule, though, the disorder involves some level of intellectual disability and developmental delays. Many people with Coffin-Siris syndrome also have “coarse facial features,” a phrase I&#39;ve come to absolutely loathe; trouble with different organ systems; and underdeveloped pinkie fingers or toes (which is how, before genetic testing came along, a specialist might suspect a patient had it). Some, though by no means all, have microcephaly.<br><br> As far as I know, my aunt&#39;s fingers and toes are all fully developed—Coffin-Siris syndrome 12 doesn&#39;t seem to affect pinkies as much—and she doesn&#39;t appear to have any organ trouble. She does, however, have microcephaly, as did four of the 12 subjects in<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(20)30400-6">the breakthrough paper about her specific subtype</a> . But what really stood out to me in that study—and I mean really shone in a hue all its own—was this: Five of the dozen subjects displayed autistic traits.<br><br> In fact, the sparse literature on this subject suggests that a substantial portion of people with Coffin-Siris syndrome, no matter what genetic variant they&#39;ve got, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.802583/full">have a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder as well</a> .<br><br> Which is what I&#39;ve suspected my aunt has had all along.<br><br> Knowing what I now do, I&#39;m that much keener to find a family with a child who has Coffin-Siris syndrome 12 that would be willing to welcome me into their home. I call Barish, the lead author of the breakthrough paper, who heroically refers me to two. But one suddenly becomes shy and the other lives in Ireland. I start making my way through the other 50 co–first authors, co–corresponding authors, and just plain co-authors listed in the study. For a long while, I get nothing—turns out I&#39;m talking to lab people, mostly—though I learn a lot about protein complexes and gene expression.<br><br> Then I reach Isabelle Thiffault, a molecular geneticist at Children&#39;s Mercy Kansas City. By some extraordinary fluke, she has, in her database, <i>four</i> children with my aunt&#39;s subtype. Two have microcephaly. One of those two is a 7-year-old girl named Emma, who lives in the Kansas City area.<br><br> I call her mom, Grace Feist. Would she mind if I paid a visit? She would not.<br><br> Grace and her husband, Jerry, took Emma in at seven months old and adopted her at a year and a half, knowing she had significant intellectual and developmental delays. They were prepared. They had fallen in love.<br><br> They also had ample state resources at their disposal, heavily subsidized or even free. More still: They had a rich universe of support groups to draw from, a sophisticated public school in their backyard, and the benefit of a culture that&#39;s come a long way toward appreciating neurodiversity.<br><br> They were able to actively choose Emma. Whereas my grandparents—pressured by doctors, stamped by stigma, broken by exhaustion and confusion and pain—felt like they had no choice but to give their daughter away.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">“So this is</span> the best thing, because it will keep your hair nice and neat, and it doesn&#39;t have any tingles.”<br><br> Tingles? I ask. It&#39;s late February of 2023. We&#39;re sitting in Emma&#39;s bedroom in Lee&#39;s Summit, Missouri, and she&#39;s waving a new silk pillowcase at me.<br><br> “They&#39;re like big stuff in your hair.” She gestures at her thick brown ponytail.<br><br> Tingles … oh, tangles!<br><br> She nods. “Guess what? Tangles will get in your hair. If Mommy&#39;s brushing, I will be so mad.”<br><br> A few feet from her is a mounted poster that says <span class="smallcaps">For like Ever</span> . As in: <i>We&#39;ve embraced this little girl for life—for, like, ever.</i> Grace got it at TJ Maxx shortly after Emma&#39;s adoption became official.<br><br> Every time I hear Emma speak, I find it hard to believe that she and my aunt have a mutation in the same gene. She chatters merrily in full sentences, talks about her friends, and can express how she feels, often in ways that are surprising or quite poignant.<br><br> “Emma, are you the same as other kids or different?” Grace asks when we pick her up at school the next day.<br><br> “Different.”<br><br> “为什么？”她问。<br><br> “Because I&#39;m the only one doing coloring. Not the other kids.”<br><br> “Do you like being different?” I ask her.<br><br> “No.”<br><br> “为什么？” I ask.<br><br> “Because I want to be like other people.”<br><br> But what I&#39;m stuck on is all the ways that Emma <i>started out</i> like my aunt. When Grace and Jerry (a very involved father, just shy around reporters) first took her in at seven months to foster her, “she just lay there like a two-month-old baby,” Grace says. “We thought she was blind.” She didn&#39;t make eye contact; she couldn&#39;t roll. But in Bismarck, North Dakota, where Grace and Jerry were living at the time, Emma was entitled to all kinds of state-funded early intervention, as she is in Missouri. By nine months old, she was sitting unsupported, thanks to hours spent in a special tube swing to help her develop her core muscles.<br><br> Emma wasn&#39;t as late to walk as Adele, but she didn&#39;t take her first wobbly step until 16 months, and because it was 2016, rather than the early 1950s, physical therapists again intervened, having her toddle on uneven surfaces—pillows, cushions—to bolster muscle tone. She developed a smoother gait at about 2, but it took a couple more years for her to have the balance and coordination to walk normally, or to climb the stairs without help.<br><br> And speech! A huge surprise. Emma may be a bubbly ingenue, telling me all about indoor recess and her BFFs at school, but that&#39;s hardly how she started. When she was 4 years old, she had only 100 words in her vocabulary, and that&#39;s a generous estimate. “The way it was described was: She&#39;s not deaf, but it&#39;s almost the speech of someone who can&#39;t hear,” Grace says. But Emma was working with state-funded speech therapists at the time, and they determined that she had auditory-processing disorder. When she got to her public school in Lee&#39;s Summit—which gives extra speech and occupational therapy to those who need it, plus additional reading and math instruction—her vocabulary started to grow, slowly at first, and then in a rush. “I don&#39;t know what it was,” Grace says.<br><br> Well. I have some idea. It was having a supportive school. It was having several hours a week of occupational, physical, and speech therapy from the time Emma was an infant. And it was Grace herself.<br><br> If you&#39;re going to have an intellectual disability, who you really want as your mother is Grace Feist. Thirty-three, forever in flip-flops, and brimming with opinions—she has the concentrated energy of a honeybee—Grace has gone to exceptional lengths to tend to Emma&#39;s education and psychological well-being. She&#39;s decorated the basement playroom in pastels and muted colors. (“With visual-processing disorder, which Emma has, it&#39;s not as overwhelming,” Grace explains.) Once a week, she takes Emma to vision therapy; she picks Emma up at school early every day to focus even more on her reading and math at home, without distraction. Grace is the queen of resourcefulness when it comes to all things pedagogical.<br><br> “I had a developmental pediatrician tell me: &#39;There is no rock you haven&#39;t looked under. This is what you have, and that&#39;s okay,&#39; ” she says. “And he came from the best of intentions. But let me tell you, there were, like, 50 rocks I hadn&#39;t looked under.”<br><br> As Grace and Emma give me a tour of Emma&#39;s in-home classroom, all I can think is, <i>My God, the effort</i> . It contains a bucket of at least 80 fidget toys, many of them simple household items repurposed for anxious hands (silicone sink scrubbers, sewing bobbins). Emma sits on a purple wobble disk—it looks like a whoopee cushion the size of a satellite dish—to continue developing her core muscles. The walls are lined with giant flash cards from Secret Stories, a phonics-based reading program that makes intuitive sense and seems kind of <i>fun</i> , which is a good thing, because almost nothing demoralizes Emma more than trying to read. She can barely do it, though she&#39;s trying.<br><br> “How does reading feel?” Grace asks.<br><br> “Mad,” Emma says. She&#39;s wearing a resplendent lavender shirt with daisies on it. “Because if Mommy say, &#39;Read this now,&#39; I would be super grumpy. Because they have hard words.” She&#39;s pointing to a rudimentary book she&#39;s been struggling with. “But some people say, &#39;This is easy!&#39; ”<br><br> “How does that make you feel?” Grace asks.<br><br> “Mad. Sad.”<br><br> We move on to look at the shelves on the wall. They&#39;re stocked with tactile learning tools: numbers made of sandpaper. Montessori cubes showing multiples of 10. Wax Wikki Stix to make letter shapes.<br><br> “If you change the approach to everything being multisensory—you see it, you hear it, you taste it, you touch it, you smell it—then you learn it,” Grace says. “Because you&#39;re using all these neural pathways for the same information. Then everyone can learn.”<br><br> Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t be surprised by Grace&#39;s tenacity. She was raised in Florida, near Orlando, and had her first daughter, Chloe, at 16. She joined the Navy as a reservist in 2010 and worked for a time as a military police officer; then she worked security in an oil field in North Dakota, where she made great money and got to see the northern lights, as long as she was willing to put up with temperatures 20 degrees below zero. She met Jerry, then an information technologist, on the website Plenty of Fish. Today, he&#39;s a professional YouTuber, with an inspirational-Christian channel that has 2.6 million subscribers. On December 28, 2016, they adopted Emma. In 2018, Grace gave birth to another daughter, Anna.<br><br> “Having Anna was the best thing for Emma,” Grace says, “because it really taught her how to play—with other kids, even with toys. That mimicking, that seeing what to do. Because when you would buy Emma toys, she would just line them up.”<br><br> Grace and Jerry have made enormous sacrifices on Emma&#39;s behalf. The whole family has. They don&#39;t travel, because Emma needs structure and control. They seldom go to restaurants, but when they do, they bring along her purple noise-canceling headphones—shooting earmuffs, purchased at Walmart—in case the sound overwhelms her; she needs to leave the restaurant several times a meal in any event, just to ground herself. “That&#39;s how we live our life,” Grace says.<br><br> Their life used to be even more difficult. When she was younger, Emma, like my aunt, was inclined toward self-harm. When I first mention to Grace that Adele has no teeth—and that I fear they were removed at Willowbrook or Wassaic—Grace cuts me off: “Because she would bite herself until she bled?”<br><br> Sweet Jesus. I hadn&#39;t even thought of that.<br><br> “Because Emma did,” Grace says. “I have pictures of it.”<br><br> She doesn&#39;t show me those pictures. But she does show me a picture of 4-year-old Emma with a giant green-and-purple Frankenstein bruise bulging from her forehead. “She&#39;d hit herself in the face,” Grace says. “She would bang her head on the floor, like, hard.”<br><br> And why does she think Emma did that? “She&#39;s trapped in this mind where she knows what she wants, she knows what she needs, but <i>you</i> don&#39;t know, and she doesn&#39;t know how to tell you,” Grace says. “Is she aggressive?是的。 I would be pissed too.”<br><br> I haven&#39;t noticed any aggression in Emma—just a lot of sass, a gal who wants to show off her dance moves and introduce me to her stuffies. But again, this may be in part due to early-childhood interventions: Armies of occupational and speech therapists taught her how to be gentle, demonstrating how to talk kindly to dolls, and they encouraged Grace to teach Emma sign language, which she did, so that Emma could better express her wishes. As Emma got older, Grace read tons of books about emotional self-regulation, teaching her daughter to externalize her frustration. “We&#39;d be in the middle of Walmart and she&#39;d be stomping her feet,” Grace says. “But you know what? She wasn&#39;t punching herself in the head.”<br><br> Today, Emma is flourishing. She may not yet know her phone number or address. She may not be able to tell you the names of the months or all the days of the week. But she&#39;s making great strides, especially now that she&#39;s learning at home. When I left her house in late February, she could count to 12; four months later, she was adding and subtracting. “Emma is going to thrive in her life,” Grace says. “Is she going to work at McDonald&#39;s? Maybe. Is she gonna bag groceries? Maybe. But she&#39;s gonna be okay.” Grace&#39;s goal, she says, is to make sure that Emma&#39;s mental health always comes first. “I have never met anyone more resilient or determined,” she adds.<br><br> As I prepare to leave, Grace gives me two gifts she&#39;s purchased for my aunt. They&#39;re things Emma likes: a lavender-scented unicorn Warmie (a stuffed animal you can safely heat in the microwave) and Pinch Me therapy dough that smells like oranges. “Anything scented is always really calming for Emma,” she explains.<br><br> Then Emma hands me a picture she&#39;s drawn of me and Adele. Grace asks if she remembers why she drew it. “Yeah!” Emma says. “Because she has a hard time going to school.”<br><br> “Like you,” Grace says. Then: “You know what her aunt has?”<br><br> I assume she is going to say something about Coffin-Siris syndrome 12, but in a way that&#39;s comprehensible to a child who has it too. But that isn&#39;t where Grace is headed. “She has a woman who loves her and takes care of her because her mommy wasn&#39;t able to. Just like you. Did you know that?”<br><br> Emma shakes her head.<br><br> I thank Grace and Emma for the gifts and head out to my rental car. I last maybe 30 seconds before losing it.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Is it a fair</span> or genuine comparison, lining up my aunt and Emma side by side? Using Emma&#39;s life story thus far as some kind of counterfactual history? To ask <i>What if?</i><br><br> Yes and no, obviously.<br><br> There&#39;s variability in all genetic disorders, including Coffin-Siris syndrome, even among those with mutations in the same gene. The original paper looking at my aunt&#39;s specific subtype found that four out of the 12 individuals had microcephaly, for example, but one had macrocephaly; go figure. My aunt and Emma, though they both have subtype 12, clearly have different manifestations of it, a phenomenon one can observe just from looking at them: Emma is big for her age while my aunt is tiny; my aunt&#39;s microcephaly is unignorable, because her sutures—the flexible material between a baby&#39;s skull bones—closed prematurely, while Emma&#39;s didn&#39;t, making her microcephaly harder to detect. Her doctor says it may be easier to see as she gets older, though.<br><br> “If your aunt had had the treatments available today, I suspect her life would be very different,” says Bonnie Sullivan, the clinical geneticist at Children&#39;s Mercy Kansas City who treats Emma. We&#39;re speaking just days after I return home. She has looked at both Adele&#39;s and Emma&#39;s specific gene mutations. “She may not have been as high-functioning as Emma, but she could have maximized her potential, and her quality of life would&#39;ve been a lot better.”<br><br> It seems impossible to quarrel with this assessment. The literature on disability is bursting with stories—heartening or depressing, depending on your point of view—about the advances made by people with intellectual disabilities once they were liberated from the medieval torments of their institutions. Studies as far back as the 1960s showed that children with Down syndrome begin to speak earlier and have higher IQs if they&#39;re kept in home settings rather than institutional ones. Judith Scott, warehoused with Down syndrome in 1950 at the age of 7, famously became an artist once her twin sister established herself as her legal guardian 35 years later; her handsome fiber-art sculptures are now part of the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Centre Pompidou.<br><br> If my aunt could expand her vocabulary simply by going off a useless antipsychotic, imagine what else she might have been capable of over the course of her life, if only she&#39;d been given a hundredth of a chance.<br><br> But perhaps the best-known example of what happens to underloved, understimulated children are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/can-an-unloved-child-learn-to-love/612253/">the orphans from Nicolae Ceauşescu&#39;s Romania</a> , where “child gulags” warehoused some 170,000 kids in appalling conditions. These children became tragic, unwilling conscripts in an inadvertent mass experiment in institutional neglect. When, 11 years after Ceauşescu&#39;s execution, American researchers finally began to study 136 of them, putting half in foster settings and monitoring their development, the findings were bleak. Only 18 percent of those still in orphanages <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4098033/">showed secure attachments by age 3 and a half</a> , versus almost 50 percent of those who&#39;d been transferred to family settings. By the time the kids still in orphanages had reached 16, more than 60 percent suffered from a psychiatric condition.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/can-an-unloved-child-learn-to-love/612253/">From the July/August 2020 issue: 30 years ago, Romania deprived thousands of babies of human contact</a><br><br> Which brings me back to my aunt&#39;s repeated diagnoses, over the years, of psychosis. Maybe the condition was inevitable; maybe my aunt would have been psychotic no matter what kind of life she&#39;d led. But when I watched those gruesome spools of footage from Willowbrook, all I could think was: <i>Who wouldn&#39;t be driven mad by such a place?</i> After she left Willowbrook, Adele would abruptly shout “Stop hurting me!” for no apparent reason. Her care team assumed she was having hallucinations, a plausible postulate. But isn&#39;t it equally plausible to theorize that she was reliving some unspeakable abuse from her past? Or, as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-life-worth-living-disability-pain-and-morality-joel-michael-reynolds/9781517907785?affiliate_id=atl-347">Georgetown philosopher and disability-studies professor Joel Michael Reynolds</a> puts it (speaking my thoughts aloud): “Why isn&#39;t that a completely reasonable response to PTSD?”<br><br> I&#39;ll never know how Adele&#39;s life could have turned out if she&#39;d been born in 2015, as Emma was. All I have is a plague of questions.<br><br> What if a task force of occupational, speech, and physical therapists had shown up at my grandparents&#39; home each week, teaching Adele to walk, talk, and gently play with dolls?<br><br> What if she had spent her formative years not rotting in her own diapers or staring at the walls, but engaging in organized play, attending school, and basking in the company of adults who loved her?<br><br> What if she&#39;d had caretakers who inhaled book after book about emotional self-regulation and encouraged her to stomp her feet in department stores, rather than hit herself in the head?<br><br> And what if— <i>what if</i> —Adele had had a sister to play with?<br><br> It&#39;s possible that all the interventions in the world would have done nothing, or next to it. Sullivan says she&#39;s seen families recruit every imaginable expert and pour their energies into every conceivable intervention, yet with depressingly little to show for it. “There are some individuals with such severe manifestations of certain disorders that aggressive interventions don&#39;t seem to change the outcome very much,” she says. “这会杀了我。 I truly grieve that result. Because the parents are trying everything.”<br><br> Similarly, there are children who wind up in residential care in spite of their parents&#39; best and most valiant efforts, because their risk of self-harm or of harming others remains too great. Parents are not, nor should they be expected to be, saints.<br><br> But my mind keeps looping back to that eight-page report my mother was sent about Adele&#39;s history. The notes from Willowbrook, what few there are, tell a story all their own.<br><br> March 19, 1953: <i>21-month-old girl, quite small for her age … able to sit without support, to imitate movements, and is reported to be able to say “mama.”</i> Adele&#39;s IQ is measured at 52.<br><br> February 1, 1960: <i>Microcephalic child of 8 ½ years with limited speech and partial echolalia. She is disoriented, and her acquaintance with simple objects in her surroundings is rather poor even for her overall mental level … Rate of development has markedly slowed down since the last evaluation 7 years ago.</i> <i>The consequent drop in IQ is considerable.</i> This time it is measured at 27.<br><br> In her seven years of staring at those walls and rocking naked on the floor and never once, I assume, being shown a particle of love apart from those brief visits from my grandparents, Adele&#39;s IQ dropped by almost half, startling even those who evaluated her. And yes, maybe this was destined to happen; maybe her smaller brain had less noticeable consequences in a toddler than in an 8-year-old.<br><br> But if my aunt could expand her vocabulary simply by going off a useless antipsychotic and onto Zyprexa—in middle age!—imagine what else she might have been capable of over the course of her life, if only she&#39;d been given a half, a quarter, a hundredth of a chance.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s A sunny day</span> in May of this year. I&#39;m working on the back deck, nearing the end of writing this story. My cellphone rings. It&#39;s Evelyn, Carmen&#39;s daughter. She apologizes for calling me on a Sunday, but something serious has happened. Adele has collapsed; she&#39;s in the hospital; it&#39;s looking bad. Can I please locate my mom?<br><br> I leave messages everywhere and call Adele&#39;s nurse, Emane, who I&#39;ve been told is in the hospital with her. Emane is upset. No one will tell her anything. She&#39;s been banished to the waiting room. They really need my mother, my aunt&#39;s medical proxy.<br><br> A few minutes later, my mother phones them. A few minutes after that, my father conveys the news to me: Adele has died.<br><br> A heart attack, apparently. Just after breakfast.<br><br> I call Evelyn. She is crying. I stammer my way through this conversation, also crying, but mainly because we barely got to know my aunt, because this was supposed to be the beginning of something and not the end, because I know the grief I feel in no way matches Evelyn&#39;s or Carmen&#39;s or Juan&#39;s. I am fluttering with an awkward mixture of shame, regret, sadness. “She was loved,” Evelyn keeps saying, over and over.<br><br> I know, I say. I just wish more by us.<br><br> “You came at exactly the right time,” Evelyn assures me. “I truly believe that.”<br><br> I hang up. God, they&#39;re so gracious, this family. “We don&#39;t judge,” Evelyn told us the first time we went up to see Adele at the Ayalas&#39;. She meant it.<br><br> I phone my mother. She has lurched into administrative mode, planning the funeral. This is peak Mom, organizing things, surmounting the tough stuff by finding footholds in the small details. I wait a bit and call Carmen, though with some trepidation. My mother says she was unhelmed—bawling—when they first spoke. Carmen, calmer but still sobbing throughout our talk, tells me it&#39;s true. “I broke down. I didn&#39;t expect it to happen like that.”<br><br> We bury Adele three days later. It&#39;s a gorgeous afternoon, perfect really, but the incongruities and dissonances of the hour are hard to ignore. Here we are, having a Jewish funeral for a woman who was never exposed to the Jewish tradition her whole life, while those whose lives have been most brutally upended—those who have spent the past 24 years loving and caring for Adele—are Catholics. My aunt will be buried next to her mother, forever reunited, while the woman whom she called “Mommy”—who just four nights ago rubbed Vicks VapoRub on her back and brought her tea because she had a cough—will go back to a house with an empty twin bed.<br><br> I&#39;d like to think that in the afterlife, my grandmother&#39;s heart will mend. That she will never again be told to send Adele away, that God will say to her: <i>It&#39;s okay, she&#39;s lovely as she is; she&#39;s my child too.</i><br><br> Problem is, I&#39;m not much of a believer. I wish I was.<br><br> But the rabbi, Lisa Rubin, is brilliant, making something seamless out of the chaotic threads of my aunt&#39;s life and the untidy grief of this motley group, managing to acknowledge the trauma of my mother, the trauma of my aunt, and the trauma of my grandparents, showing them the compassion they deserved their whole lives but probably never got and certainly never gave to themselves. And she honors the Ayala family in the most beautiful way, invoking the Jewish legend of the <i>Lamed Vavniks</i> , or 36 individuals in every generation who are the most righteous of all humanity. “They&#39;re often called the hidden saints among us,” she says. “The people who do God&#39;s work faithfully and humbly and whose virtue keeps the world spinning. They pour compassion and love on those around them with no desire for recognition.” To my family, she says, Carmen, Juan, and Evelyn are the <i>Lamed Vavniks</i> —“the hidden saints of Adele&#39;s life.”<br><br> The Ayalas are all discreetly weeping. Carmen will later tell me: <i>I will miss Adele so much</i> .<br><br> My mother is invited to speak next. Evelyn will speak after her, then one of Adele&#39;s housemates, then Adele&#39;s psychologist, then her case manager—it&#39;s wonderful that they&#39;ve turned up.<br><br> But my mother … I&#39;m not quite prepared. She starts with a version of something I&#39;ve heard before—that losing Adele was a trauma that took decades to heal. But then she elaborates in a way she hasn&#39;t even in our most intimate discussions: The three times she saw Adele back in the &#39;90s, she still felt disconnected from her. Adele&#39;s previous caretakers had left my mom and my grandmother (and in one case, my mom and me) all alone with my aunt in their living room; they hadn&#39;t said a thing about who Adele was or what her place was in their home. That changed, my mother says, when she saw Adele at the Ayalas&#39;, discovering the charming, idiosyncratic character of her baby sister—and how very much she was loved, how she fit into a family.<br><br> “Those visits changed everything for me,” she says. “I opened my heart to Adele after shutting her out for nearly 70 years, and I found myself loving her again the same way I did as a 6-year-old child.” I hear a catch in her voice. She pauses, then regains her composure. “Now,” she continues, “I&#39;ve lost Adele for the second time. And it hurts in a way I never expected. But I would not trade those visits for anything, because my life is so much richer. Adele has taught me to love in a whole new way.”<br><br> She finishes. And then, without warning, she rushes into the arms of my dad and starts crying in deep, seismic sobs. “I lost all those years,” she says into his shirt. I can barely make it out.<br><br> I&#39;ve never seen her sense of control desert her in this way.<br><br> My mind wanders back to the last time I saw Adele. It was December, when Emane swabbed her cheek. I was alone then, just me and my recording device; my mother was in Florida. Carmen reminded Adele that I was her niece, her sister&#39;s daughter. “Do you remember Rona?”她问。 “Yeah,” Adele said, but it wasn&#39;t a convincing “yeah”—more like one of the blank ones she uttered when she didn&#39;t understand.<br><br> We collected Adele&#39;s DNA, and then I stuck around, curious to see how my aunt passed her afternoons and evenings. Spending that brief stretch with her meant experiencing time in a sensual way, almost, just feeling the thickness of the hours as they passed. We sat for a while together in the kitchen. Then we went upstairs to her bedroom, a warm, delightful space, her dresser tumbling with stuffed animals and her bed popping with a pink Disney-princess blanket. Adele carefully selected her outfit for the next day, matching every item of clothing, down to her socks.<br><br> There are many different shades of periwinkle blue. I had no idea.<br><br> Then she undressed, put on a plush lavender bathrobe, and headed into the shower to slowly bathe herself and wash her hair. Carmen supervised, but left her alone. After she&#39;d dried herself off, Adele headed back into her room, closed all of the blinds (“for night”), and settled into her rocking chair. She spent the next half an hour, at least, just rocking. She often wiggled her fingers in front of her eyes. Occasionally she broke into a smile or chanted the same words to herself (“paint, pepper”) or gave a little laugh. She seemed content.<br><br> But in the shower—and I&#39;ll never forget this, not for as long as my battered memory is intact—she babbled much more coherently. “Sister. Rona. Janet. Mirna. Rrrrrrrona”—she rolled the <i>R</i> —“A doll. A teddy bear.”<br><br> I&#39;ve listened to that wisp of audio dozens of times, just to make sure I didn&#39;t wish those words into existence.<br><br><i>姐姐。 Rona.</i> She was already committing my mother&#39;s name to memory, and to her own family tree, along with Carmen&#39;s daughter and daughter-in-law, Mirna and Janet. Her ability to sweep in such things was, as Evelyn said, her gift. And now, we in our family will finally be committing her name to ours, which for so long—so pointlessly long—had a phantom bough.<br><br> Adele Halperin. Daughter, sister, aunt.
