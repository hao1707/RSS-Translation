referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>伊芙琳霍克斯坦/路透社</figcaption></figure>在爱荷华州博览会上，我附近的人们都很疯狂。 “你看到他了吗？”他们气喘吁吁。 “你认为他会到人群中讲话吗？”当特勤局官员明确表示前总统唐纳德·特朗普将出现在大广场的 Steer &#39;N Stein 餐厅时，展会上的人们排起了长队，队伍的尽头在视线之外。<br><br>并不是所有的人都能挤进餐厅，所以他们挤满了外面的街道，一大群热切、满头大汗的爱荷华人。当这位前总统终于出现时，人群拥挤不堪，从餐厅的空旷一侧几乎看不清他的轮廓。 “你知道，其他候选人也来到了这里，他们大约有六个人，”特朗普令人眼花缭乱的声音通过我们上方的扬声器说道。观众报以热烈的掌声和欢呼声。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/trump-indictment-unsealed-2024-presidential-campaign/674359/">大卫·阿克塞尔罗德：起诉书令人震惊。特朗普的支持者会关心吗？</a><br><br>美国政治中为数不多的能够经受住过去动荡岁月的怪异的规则之一是，任何想成为美国总统的人都必须忍受爱荷华州博览会的众多辉煌和同样多的仪式性羞辱。这是一次重要的试镜，至少对共和党来说是这样。 （民主党最近重新调整了初选顺序，将爱荷华州党团会议的全国第一地位降级。）<br><br>如果一位浑身是汗、塞满了炸黄油的共和党候选人能够激起爱荷华州挑剔选民的兴趣，那么这位候选人就在预选会议上有真正的机会，也许还有入主白宫的机会。有时，一个前景渺茫的局外人可以吸引人群并获得意想不到的优势，就像里克·桑托勒姆 (Rick Santorum) 在 2012 年和泰德·克鲁兹 (Ted Cruz) 在 2016 年所做的那样。<br><br>因此，博览会是一个让人着迷和被迷住的地方。周末早些时候，它似乎发挥了魔力。<br><br> “他真的非常有魅力，”来自得梅因的雪莉·伯吉斯这样评价迈克·彭斯。 “我认为他亲自传达的信息比我在电视上从他那里得到的信息要清晰得多。”这位前副总统刚刚<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kcci.com/article/mike-pence-joins-governor-kim-reynolds-for-iowa-state-fair-side-chat/44794244">结束了</a>共和党州长金雷诺兹主持的几场“公平谈判”之一。这是博览会上的一个新特色，州长会向候选人提出一些尖锐的问题，例如“你最喜欢的罢工歌曲是什么？”<br><br>前一天晚上，彭斯被一名男子质问，“在塔克·卡尔森毁了你的职业生涯之后”，他过得怎么样。另一个人说：“我很高兴他们没有绞死你！”<br><br>但周五早上，彭斯在 JR 的南猪牧场与雷诺兹的谈话吸引了一群尊敬的人群。与会者向他提出了礼貌的问题，六人亲自感谢他在特朗普试图推翻 2020 年大选结果时的“正直”。<br><br>不过，彭斯也有同伴。佛罗里达州州长 Ron DeSantis、前联合国大使 Nikki Haley 和企业家 Vivek Ramaswamy 也在猪肉牧场和<i>得梅因纪事报</i>的 Soapbox 场地吸引了人群。大多数出席的尚未做出决定的爱荷华州人告诉我，他们在 2016 年和 2020 年都支持特朗普。他们说，这些选民赞赏他的服务，但经过八年在社交媒体上的愚蠢咆哮、毫无根据但无情的选举舞弊断言和面对一连串的刑事起诉，他们渴望一些新的活力。他们告诉我，你知道，一个没有那么多包袱的领导者；有人更……优雅。<br><br> “从他嘴里说出来的一切就像是，‘闭嘴，唐纳德’”来自爱荷华州约翰斯顿的两次特朗普选民查尔斯·邓拉普 (Charles Dunlap) 告诉我。他渴望听到拉马斯瓦米和黑利的意见，他相信他们会“制定与特朗普类似的政策”——只是没有戏剧性。<br><br>但周六下午 1 点左右，当这位前总统抵达时，博览会的亲密魅力——深思熟虑、慎重考虑的承诺——消失了。很快我就清楚了，那天早上我遇到的那些对特朗普精疲力尽、思想发生改变的爱荷华州人只是少数。大多数人？他们仍然爱特朗普。<br><br>这位前总统跳过了肥皂盒和雷诺兹的可能演讲时段（因为他与州长的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-feuds-iowa-gov-kim-reynolds-rcna93470">奇怪冲突</a>），但出现与他的人民打成一片。他们挤进了总统可能发表讲话的每一个公平场所。由于他的活动没有任何官方时间表，所以每个人都在猜测。游乐场的部分区域陷入瘫痪。那些只想喝柠檬水、欣赏获奖小公牛的人们感到很恼火。 “为什么我们一定要在所有政客都来的那天来？”一个推着婴儿车穿过人群的男人问他的妻子。 （根据记录，几乎每个爱荷华州人都曾经说过这句话。）<br><br>鉴于他在共和党初选民意调查中遥遥领先，特朗普的出现会引发如此热烈的情绪也就不足为奇了。但看到它，感受到它，却是不同的。相比之下，聚集在一起支持其他共和党候选人的人群似乎一点也不令人印象深刻。突然之间，整个共和党初选都让人感到痛苦的徒劳，甚至可悲。<i>他们为什么要这样做？</i>对于落选者来说——基本上是竞选中的其他人——在竞选过程中遭受的虐待是否值得被任命为特朗普的竞选搭档，即使是最好的情况？<br><br>周六，当彭斯站在阳光下翻转猪肉汉堡时，人群中的人们窃窃私语着他。 “看看他的汗水，”我身后有人说。 “他是个笨蛋，德桑蒂斯也是，”来自锡达拉皮兹的一位名叫雅各布（拒绝透露姓氏）的年轻人告诉我。 “你只是想拿走他们的午餐钱。这是本能。”拉马斯瓦米的个性吸引了许多共和党人，他在接受州长采访后显然觉得有必要表现<i>得不那么呆板</i>，并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?c5081268/vivek-ramaswamy-raps-eminems-lose-yourself">自信地</a>唱着埃米纳姆的歌曲“Lose Yourself”。一大群银发围观者发现自己被困在舞台前面，不得不笨拙地向前移动。<br><br>德桑蒂斯在展会上遭受的损失比其他任何人都大。当他与雷诺兹交谈时，一架飞机在头顶盘旋，上面挂着一个长长的标语，上面写着<span class="smallcaps">“讨人喜欢，罗恩！”</span>德桑蒂斯假装没有注意到。当佛罗里达州州长在猪肉帐篷里轮到他时，特朗普的支持者聚集在他的拍照区后面，戴着特朗普竞选团队分发的绿黄相间的卡车司机帽。当德桑蒂斯和他的妻子翻转汉堡时，他们高喊口号并大声辱骂。<br><br>当特朗普最终于周六下午抵达时，他带来了一群在德桑蒂斯问题上支持他的佛罗里达州议员。 （众议员马特·盖兹（Matt Gaetz）表示，他在猪肉帐篷里烤的汉堡做得很好，但“你能做到的最好的就是罗恩·德桑蒂斯”，这让人群热情高涨。）这种羞辱最终会得到回报吗？德桑蒂斯的竞选团队必须希望如此。至少在爱荷华州，佛罗里达州州长<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/us/politics/trump-iowa-poll.html">的竞选比在全国范围内更接近特朗普</a>。<br><br>当天早些时候，我采访了马特·威尔斯（Matt Wells），他是德桑蒂斯的支持者，也是来自爱荷华州华盛顿的县主席，他整个上午都在集市上跟踪这位候选人。特朗普的人民“并不真正知道自己在做什么；他们不知道自己在做什么”。 “这都是情感上的事情，”他告诉我。威尔斯曾在 2016 年为特德·克鲁兹的竞选团队工作过。他说，当时他们的地面比赛表现出色，就像德桑蒂斯现在所做的那样。 “特朗普，”威尔斯补充道，“这里没有任何地面游戏。”<br><br><a

年大选。当我正要说出这个事实时，我们附近的一个人倒吸了一口气。十几根手指指向天空，人们开始兴奋地尖叫。在我们头顶的亮蓝色海洋中，有一架侧面印有<span class="smallcaps">特朗普</span>字样的飞机正飞往附近的机场。有人低声问道：“我有没有告诉过你，我握过他的手两次？”喧闹声越来越大。<br><br>特朗普很快就会来这里。这个人，那个神话，已经登陆了。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 16:03:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊插图。资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure>在过去的几十年里，美国人对饮料的需求在两个极端之间剧烈摇摆。 20世纪90年代，甜饮料风靡一时。苏打水的销量似乎处于无限上升的轨道上。奎克 (Quaker) 以 17 亿美元现金收购了当时方兴未艾的 Snapple 品牌，当我在 2023 年的严酷灯光下读到这个数字时，我真的感到嗤之以鼻。Surge、Orbitz 和 SoBe“elixirs”等花哨的饮料挤满了杂货店的货架。 。作为 90 年代末的中学生，我的消费模式实际上是那个时代营销魔法的一个案例研究。在足球训练之外，我不确定我的嘴唇是否曾沾过一滴白开水。<br><br>到那个十年末，即将到来的逆转的第一个证据已经显而易见。对糖和人造甜味剂的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/04/upshot/soda-industry-struggles-as-consumer-tastes-change.html">怀疑</a>（大部分是有道理的，尽管有些不是）逐渐增长。汽水巨头了解了情况，开始营销自己的瓶装水品牌，以与依云和巴黎水等更时尚的品牌竞争。 Dasani 和 Aquafina 来得正是时候：随着苏打水销量的下滑，瓶装水的销量开始腾飞。 2016 年，饮料营销公司估计，美国人<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.beveragemarketing.com/news-detail.asp?id=438">消耗的瓶装水</a>（人均近 40 加仑）首次超过了碳酸饮料。自来水也在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.modernretail.co/retailers/the-resiliency-is-terrific-why-water-bottle-sales-are-on-fire/">越来越多的</a>可重复使用水瓶中找到了新家。新的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/17/style/stanley-tumbler.html">斯坦利杯</a>，有人要吗？<br><br>简而言之，美国人热衷于补充水分。正如我的同事 Katherine J. Wu <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/drinking-water-hydration-amount-importance/674926/">最近所写</a>，每个人需要喝多少水才能维持健康基线仍然是专家之间存在重大分歧的话题。但在缺乏明确指导的情况下，并且在健康和保健行业的大力鼓励下，许多人似乎只是简单地认为越多越好，他们每天的摄入量最多为一加仑。<br><br>这并不是说每个人都<em>喜欢</em>喝这些水。随着国家自律地补充杯子，美国人被迫面对一个不方便的现实，即日复一日地喝白开水可能是一件苦差事。为了抑制这一切，他们又重新使用粉末和浓缩糖浆，旨在使水更可口、更健康，或两者兼而有之。甜饮料又回来了，尽管形式不同。输入<em>水强化剂</em>。<br><br>如今，杂货店和便利店随处可见用于美化水的产品。它们装在颜色鲜艳的小挤压瓶或单份包装中。销售说辞非常简单：将其放入钱包或笔记本电脑包中，然后喷几滴糖浆或将一汤匙或两汤匙粉末混合到普通水中，而不是购买包装饮料。瞧。现在水好多了。这不完全是一种<em>新型</em>产品：Crystal Light 和 Gatorade 的粉状混合物在 20 世纪 80 年代就已出现。但与过去的水强化剂不同的是，今天的混合物大多是单份而不是大批量。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/drinking-water-hydration-amount-importance/674926/">阅读：您可能喝了足够的水</a><br><br>据食品杂货行业专家、Supermarket Guru 网站创始人菲尔·伦珀特 (Phil Lempert) 介绍，补水剂大致分为两类：低热量调味品，例如卡夫亨氏的高浓度 MiO 滴剂，以及补水运动（或解酒）饮料。例如 Liquid IV 的粉末状电解质包 MiO 和 Liquid IV 均于 2010 年代初首次亮相。几年之内，LMNT、Cure、Buoy 等竞争对手纷纷进入市场，还有来自老品牌的新进入者，如水晶灯 (Crystal Light) 和佳得乐 (Gatorade)。大多数这些品牌都夸耀其产品的含糖量低；甚至一些味道像彩虹糖、星爆糖或其他糖果的增强剂也依赖于人工或替代甜味剂，并且热量很少。其他成分已被纳入新产品中：Cure 等公司现在生产含咖啡因的浓缩物。 Liquid IV 是一种粉末，含有促进睡眠的褪黑激素。现在许多其他产品都含有额外的维生素、矿物质或电解质。许多补水剂本质上已成为可饮用的补充剂。<br><br>水强化剂的增长可以很容易地用销售数字来表示。消费者数据公司 Circana 的食品和饮料行业分析师达伦·塞弗 (Darren Seifer) 告诉我，尽管这些产品仍然只占整个饮料市场的一小部分，但它们已经实现了持续增长。 2022 年，混合运动饮料（该公司添加最多水分强化剂的类别）的销量比上一年增长了 15%。 Seifer 表示，一些品牌的增长幅度要大得多。 Liquid IV 于 2020 年被联合利华收购，其发言人告诉我，该品牌的销售额在过去四年中每年几乎翻倍。<br><br>与许多文化现象一样，水强化剂也已成为病毒式传播趋势的主题。 WaterTok 是 TikTok 的一个子集，用户可以将不同的粉末和糖浆混合搭配到巨型隔热水瓶中的食谱中，今年早些时候，该公司在互联网上充斥着有关如何使自来水尝起来像生日蛋糕等味道的技巧。 （与大多数 TikTok 趋势一样，这有点极端，而且似乎并不能特别表明普通人最终如何使用这些产品。TikTok 弗兰肯水听起来有点可怕，一些健康专家对其潜力<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/watertok-tiktok-water-experts-concerned-1234714010/">表示担忧</a>误用作为减肥辅助品。）<br><br>水强化的整个概念很容易被嘲笑：确切地说，为什么有些人自己无法喝普通的水？为什么他们需要它尝起来像彩虹糖？为什么有些人认为随机的健康公司实际上可能能够改善<em>水</em>的质量？一旦你把水倒进杯子里，就停下来！喝那个！是的，喝 Jolly Rancher 阿斯巴甜水确实比喝健怡可乐更可笑。但是，如果您放下对偶尔获得许可的糖果品牌的立即反感，并考虑水增强剂作为一个概念的优点，您会发现即使是其中最糟糕的一种，在功能上也与无糖运动饮料没有太大区别或低热量柠檬水。在大多数情况下，如果您的目标是保持水分、吃点零食，并对在此过程中消耗多少糖或甜味剂有一定的发言权，那么它们可能会更好。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/artificial-sweetener-aspartame-diet-coke-cancer-link-who/674586/">阅读：活着对健康有害</a><br><br>没有理由相信使用水强化剂的人这样做是以牺牲他们原本饮用的白水为代价的。从所有迹象来看，美国人对白水的消费仍然强劲。主要是苏打水和果汁的销售普遍低迷，这至少暗示，对于很多喜欢这些类型饮料的人来说，实际上需要在补水剂和某种高甜饮料之间进行权衡。 。总的来说，在很多情况下，这种权衡似乎是积极的，特别是因为增强剂可以让人们控制饮料中实际加入的甜度。这并不能<em>保证</em>人们消耗较低浓度的调味品，但至少允许他们根据需要这样做。<br><br>为了充分理解为什么人们突然对水强化剂如此热衷，你还必须把目光投向饮料市场之外，看看经常用来饮用它们的容器类型：可重复使用的水瓶和大容量保温杯。根据 Circana 的数据，世界各地的 Hydro Flasks、Yetis 和 Stanleys 仍然热销，它们使许多美国人日常获取液体的方式发生了重大变化，而且可能还改变了其中的多少他们打算饮用的液体。如果你在工作时办公桌上已经有 30 或 40 盎司的水，那么购买佳得乐或椰子水或其他预混合饮料随身携带就没有其他意义了，并且准备几包加糖电解质笔记本电脑包中的粉末相对容易。<br><br>所有这一切的核心是一种根本性的焦虑。美国人希望为自己的健康尽其所能，但对很多人来说，最有意义的改变是更容易、更实惠地获得营养食品；花时间锻炼；减轻压力——很难实现或超出他们的控制范围。用看似更健康的饮料代替含糖饮料可能不会改变生活，但至少感觉像是<em>某种东西</em>。 “就健康行为而言，这是一个容易实现的目标，”消费者数据公司 Mintel 的食品和饮料分析师 Caleb Bryant 告诉我。经常购买瓶装水的人也存在同样的焦虑，Circana 的 Seifer 指出，这一群体仍然是一个庞大的群体，其数量尚未出现任何下降。如果你销售的是水强化剂，你不需要像瓶装饮料那样让瓶装水饮用者放弃他们已经喜欢的产品，你只需让他们相信他们偶尔会喜欢在其中添加一些东西。<br><br>增强剂有其局限性。它们赋予的自由很容易误导消费者，让他们误以为自混合饮料实际上有多好：我采访过的专家都同意，至少有些人似乎认为，无论他们使用多少或哪种水增强剂，他们的饮料最终会比预先包装的东西更健康，只是因为他们在添加任何东西之前先看到水。这样一来，补水剂背后的品牌仍然从令人困惑的补水炒作中获利颇丰，多年来这种炒作一直以令人怀疑的健康方式剥夺了人们的金钱。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/soda-lemon-lime-starry-sprite-pop/674857/">阅读：所有苏打水都是柠檬酸橙苏打水</a><br><br>不过，总的来说，水强化剂似乎确实为那些希望水变得更美味的人和想要向他们出售水的公司提供了一些理想的东西。从某种程度上来说，它们是一种罕见的双赢：根据 Supermarket Guru 的 Lempert 的说法，水增强剂更小、更轻的比例对于营销它们的公司来说具有显着的优势。他告诉我，与食品杂货行业的许多其他部门相比，饮料业务作为一个整体已经是一个利润更高、成本密集度更低的类别，这可能有助于解释所有新贵涌向增水剂类别的原因——它们的生产成本低廉，而且不会很快变质。当您不再需要购买塑料瓶以及包装、运输和储存重液体时，饮料数学就会变得更好。消费者也发现了这些差异中的一些优势：它们产生的塑料废物更少（只要您不总是购买瓶装水来使用它们），占用食品储藏室的空间更少，有时每份的价格比瓶装水便宜选择。<br><br>最终，水强化剂受欢迎的最大推动力可能只是水本身的性质。它很棒，但是每天喝大量的它会变得很苦差事。这些添加剂产品助长了人类几千年来对水的追求，以追求健康、刺激或快乐。茶、咖啡、啤酒、葡萄酒和甜果味饮料（例如阿瓜斯弗雷斯卡斯）的开发都是因为，在某种程度上，水——尽管它是不起眼的和实用的——并不能满足我们祖先的所有需求和欲望。 。现在很多人认为为了健康他们需要每天喝几升水，他们重新发现了一个古老的问题。是的，水很棒。但也许它可以更好，或者至少更有趣？<br><br>你<em>确实</em>需要喝水；任何因过度补水而犯下的错误，在补水量达到极限之前都不会真正显现出来。但为了追求完美的身体健康而放弃一点乐趣或风味，是人类从来都不太擅长做的事情。一本<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.medievalists.net/2023/05/drink-water-middle-ages/">中世纪的宗教文献</a>甚至引用只喝白开水作为对咒骂上帝的公正惩罚。考虑到这一点，如果期望在 21 世纪有如此多的替代品，大量的白开水将长期成为人们普遍选择的饮料，那可能是愚蠢的。<br><br></div>

Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>小时候，我在照片、故事和广告中看到了这个国家，并了解了一些关于美国的残酷事实。 <br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>照片插图由 Joanne Imperio/《大西洋月刊》拍摄。资料来源：生活/哥伦比亚特区公共图书馆</figcaption></figure>我在 20 世纪 50 年代长大，在弗吉尼亚州的一个农场里长大，距离任何城镇或邻居都只有几英里远。在我童年的大部分时间里，我们没有电视，所以我和我的三个兄弟在我们房子周围的田野和树林里假装内战，或者争夺我们铺在客厅地板上的纸牌和棋盘游戏来取乐。 。<br><br>但对我来说，最好的娱乐总是读书。我读书是为了乐趣，为了陪伴，为了逃离我封闭的弗吉尼亚世界。我可以探索其他地方，想象自己进入其他生活——这种生活超出了我母亲和她圈子里的女性所能提供的有限选择，她们都受到那个时代女性家庭生活规定的统治。文字让我了解了女孩<em>可以</em>做的事情：像南希·德鲁一样解开谜团；像安妮·弗兰克一样勇敢地面对纳粹；需求改变，就像<em>《Susan Anthony: Girl Who Dared》</em>的主角一样。借用斯考特在<em>《杀死一只知更鸟》</em>中的话来说，阅读可以提供一种逃离“粉红色棉质监狱的浆糊墙壁逼近我”的方法。言语可以带我越过我们房子后面升起的蓝岭山脉的缓坡。他们提出了对国家和全球事务的看法，让我产生了紧迫感。令我感到害怕的是，人造卫星已经发射升空，并且每 96 分钟就会在其地球轨道上飞过头顶。我想知道俄罗斯人是如何在太空中击败我们的。匈牙利人反对共产主义的勇气激励了我。战后美国充满信心的繁荣景象让我感到安心。然而，当我读到有关破坏它的动荡和冲突的描述时，我感到越来越怀疑和不安。<br><br>我们没有收到普通日报。我父亲从事马业，所以<em>《</em><em>晨报》——</em>纯种马赛马的圣经——每天都会出现在早餐桌上。当他教我解读当天跑步的每匹马打印的复杂的“过去表现”图表时，我感到很自豪，图表详细说明了之前的比赛、负重、分段时间和比赛结果：获胜、名次、表演或同时参加。 <em>《电讯报》</em>包含了人们想要的关于赛道世界的所有新闻，但几乎没有关于公共事务世界的新闻。<br><br>我们确实收到了很多杂志。我父亲买了一本一次性的<em>《花花公子》</em> ，把它塞在家里书柜的角落里，我们孩子们不可避免地会发现它们。我记得仔细阅读内容时，总是对插页中的女性感到惊讶，她们看起来就像我从未见过的人，无论穿着还是其他方面。然而，大多数杂志都放在书房的木架上，旁边是楼梯下一张舒适的软垫椅子。这是一个吸引人的阅读场所，有一个吸引人的出版物图书馆。 <em>《体育画报》</em> 、 <em>《周六晚邮报</em>》和<em>《马纪事报》</em>都是常客， <em>《纽约客》</em>也是常客，它的漫画吸引了我，尽管我常常不得不请父母解释为什么其中的漫画很有趣。 。<br><br>最重要的是，我阅读<em>《生活》</em>杂志。很难想象，在当今碎片化的媒体环境中，任何单一信息来源如何能够覆盖全国的一小部分地区。 1950 年，估计有一半的美国人每周都会看<em>《生活》杂志</em>。我就是其中之一。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/07/mailer-on-the-moon/590629/">阅读：“魔鬼设计的艺术品”</a><br><br><em>现在</em>，六十多年过去了，我翻阅了一本又一本涵盖我童年时光的杂志，我对它所描绘的 20 世纪 50 年代的世界如此熟悉又如此陌生感到震惊。戴维·克罗克特 (Davy Crockett) 浣熊皮帽、呼拉圈、弹簧单高跷、猫王—— <em>《生活》</em>杂志记载的狂热甚至蔓延到了弗吉尼亚乡村。我几乎认出了该杂志每期数十页广告中推销的每一种产品，尽管其中许多产品已经存在多年了。大多数期刊的封底都展示了整版香烟广告——Lucky Strikes（“更干净、更清新、更顺滑”）或Camels（“快乐有助于你的性情，这是一个心理学事实！这就是为什么日常快乐——例如吸烟” ——意义重大。”） <em>《生活》</em>杂志发表的一篇关于分娩的新闻报道描述了一名妇女在分娩时吸烟的故事。现在这让我感到震惊，但当时我认为家中充满了母亲每天一包骆驼和父亲的雪茄产生的烟雾是理所当然的。<br><br>杂志中的多页跨页展示了最新型号的大型汽车，这些汽车的设计就像我们的家庭旅行车一样，旨在运送婴儿潮时期的所有儿童。这些广告中的车辆都配有华丽的鳍片，而且通常是时尚的两种色调，尽管到了本世纪末，纳什·兰布勒 (Nash Rambler)、福特猎鹰 (Ford Falcon) 甚至大众甲壳虫 (VW Beetle) 等小型车型也开始发起挑战。<br><br> <em>《生活》</em>中出现的食物现在看来几乎是难以想象的。<br><br>一则汽水广告敦促家长在婴儿奶瓶中添加7Up，以哄他们喝奶（建议比例：各半）。另一则广告宣布“全国用完剩菜做果冻沙拉周”的到来。对于精致的西南烧烤来说，“所有东西，甚至肉，都来自罐头。” 20世纪50年代中期，美国家庭平均每年消耗850罐食品。 1955 年 1 月的一期食品特刊赞扬了“冷冻、罐装、脱水和预煮食品中内置的仆人，为忙碌的妇女在准备日常膳食时提供了一千个额外的帮助”。这些忙碌的女性总是匆匆忙忙，并且欢迎速溶燕麦片、速溶咖啡和斯旺森电视晚餐等创新产品。<br><br><em>生活</em>记录了当代存在的各个方面的出现，我倾向于认为这些方面从一开始就存在。这是信用卡进入美国人生活的十年。州际公路系统于 1956 年启动。乘客乘坐喷气式飞机旅行始于 1958 年。在这十年的前半段， <em>《生活》杂志</em>经常报道令人不安的飞机失事事件，令人震惊的是，也许是因为空中交通管制只存在于机场附近，而飞行员本身负责在其他飞机未起飞或降落时发现它们。 1956 年，两名飞行员在大峡谷上空执行任务失败，造成 128 人死亡，美国联邦航空局 (FAA) 最终接管了全国范围内的责任。我的母亲讨厌坐飞机，多年来尽最大努力让她的孩子们避免乘坐飞机，这并不奇怪。<br><br>如果我读<em>《生活》</em>是为了寻找我成年生活的模式，我会很难找到很多关于未来的令人鼓舞的内容。每三到四张封面都会出现一位女性的迷人照片——几乎总是一位知名或新兴的电影明星：泡泡浴中的雪莱·温特斯、“可爱的莉兹·泰勒”、秋千上的琼·柯林斯、索菲亚·罗兰、奥黛丽·赫本、金·诺瓦克。这样的生活显然是遥不可及的——在我看来，这样的生活也没什么意义。其他类型的关于女性的故事很少，而且绝大多数反映了对美国女性正在成为什么样的人的不安。 1955年，一篇题为“每周工作80小时”的文章将家庭主妇描述为美国“最大、工作最努力、收入最低的职业群体”。文章中的中产阶级白人女性并没有公开抱怨自己的负担，但她的话语传达了一种令人震惊的绝望。 “我只是希望我能去一次长途旅行，”她说。<br><br> 1956 年 12 月， <em>《生活》</em>杂志出版了双联特刊《美国妇女：她的成就与烦恼》。焦点再次集中在中产阶级白人女性身上，开场故事讲述了美国“美女”，她们称赞自己来自“许多种族血统”——比如德国人和斯堪的纳维亚人。一位撰稿人总结道，战后美国女性享受的新自由造成了“情感和心理问题”的“反作用”。正如该期社论所指出的那样，“美国女性经常被讨论……作为她自己和他人的问题。”<em>生活</em>似乎比贝蒂·弗里丹的经典著作<em>《女性的奥秘》</em>早了近十年。<br><br>我希望童年时的自己在翻阅这本杂志时跳过了这些故事。他们只能让我充满恐惧。不过，也许我停下来看一篇文章，它传达了更鼓舞人心的信息，并与我后来的生活直接相关：“女性思想的艰难训练场；布林莫尔为女孩们设定了很高的目标。”文章称，该学院提供“美国所有大学中最密集的智力培训”。近十年后，布林莫尔学院为我提供了一条生命线。<br><br>从很多方面来说， <em>《生活》杂志</em>向女性提供这样的认可，尤其是承认她们的不满，都是非常具有前瞻性的。一位心怀不满的读者批评编辑竟然讨论了这个话题。 “呸！世界形势就是这样……你把<em>《生活》</em>的 172 页都写满了女性。”事实上， <em>《生活》杂志</em>经常在数十个页面上充斥着女性——在杂志上刊登的广告中推销汽车、电器、美容产品和时尚。当然，这些女性并不是心怀不满的家庭主妇，而是热情的消费者。这样的一幅肖像比任何探究性别神话表面之下的努力更容易吸引<em>《生活</em>》杂志的读者。<br><br>整个 20 世纪 50 年代， <em>《生活》杂志</em>上无数的广告展示了裹着腰带的女性——就像 Playtex 的“Magic-Controller”恰如其分——并以精心设计的胸罩以及 1952 年首次推出的名为“Merry Widow”的恶魔装置为特色。这个装置从胸部一直延伸到腰带顶部，确保没有任何肉体能够逃脱适当的紧身胸衣的约束。曾作为美国外交政策口号出现的“遏制”原则似乎在女性时尚中也有其对应物。 Men&#39;s bodies were not subjected to such

Mamie Eisenhower was pink&#39;s greatest champion, introducing it into the White House—“First Lady Pink” was the particular hue—as well as in plumbing fixtures in her own Gettysburg house. In my mind, pink was the color that marked girls as frail and sweet and irrelevant. Not unlike a girdle or a Merry Widow, pink seemed intended to contain.<br><br> <em>Life</em> ’s pages of advertisements were an advertisement for America, its abundance and its complacency. Complacency was reflected in much of the magazine&#39;s news content as well. Americans in the 1950s, the magazine editorialized, were “mightily pleased with themselves.” But who were the Americans <em>Life</em> addressed and portrayed? With the exception of a butler serving a drink on a silver tray, every individual pictured in the hundreds of <em>Life</em> ads I&#39;ve seen from the 1950s was white.<br><br> The magazine&#39;s news stories exhibited more variety. <em>Life</em> regularly featured Black athletes and entertainers. Marian Anderson, Sidney Poitier, Harry Belafonte, WC Handy, Floyd Patterson, Bill Russell, Sugar Ray Robinson, Althea Gibson, and Willie Mays occupied categories in which mid-century white America had come to acknowledge Black achievement. In the course of the decade, the magazine began covering other Black Americans as well, but these stories were neither appreciations nor celebrations. Instead, they were focused on what was often called “the Negro Problem”—how Black people constituted a crisis in American life and a challenge to the idealized images of American democracy and prosperity that the magazine consistently foregrounded.<br><br> Starting with the Supreme Court&#39;s <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> decision in 1954, <em>Life</em> demonstrated steady support for the civil-rights movement, even as it sought to present the variety of positions in the escalating national debate about race. Voices of white southerners who opposed integration or thought it should not be mandated by federal courts were given serious attention. <em>Life</em> even enlisted William Faulkner to warn the nation: “Go slow now. Stop for a time, a moment.” The white southerner, Faulkner observed, “faces an obsolescence in his own land which only he can cure.” But <em>Life</em> ’s gestures at what it prized as objectivity and evenhandedness appeared alongside a clear commitment to Black progress and equality, evident in both editorial and news content. From 1954 to 1956, <em>Life</em> published 46 articles about civil rights, filling 160 pages of the magazine. Overwhelmingly, these chronicled the stories of Black efforts to advance integration and the ensuing white backlash of cruelty and violence—from racist schoolyard taunts to bombings, beatings, and lynchings.<br><br> In 1956, the magazine published a five-part series on segregation, introduced with a dramatic and disturbing cover illustration depicting an antebellum Charleston slave auction. <em>Life</em> ’s rendering of the nation&#39;s past was remarkably critical in the context of both its time and its middlebrow identity; the magazine avoided any romanticized or sanitized version of America&#39;s racial history. Disturbing portraits of the nation&#39;s past included illustrations of Confederates shooting wounded Black prisoners during the Civil War, white people slaughtering Black people seeking political rights in Louisiana&#39;s 1873 Colfax massacre, and a horrifying photograph from the early 20th century of a Black man being burned alive by a crowd of jeering white men.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/membership/archive/2018/04/the-magazine-and-martin-luther-king/557222/">Read: The magazine and Martin Luther King</a><br><br> These were not stories regularly told in the era&#39;s history books. But they were images that riveted my attention, because the world they portrayed differed so markedly from the narrative of benevolent white paternalism and genteel racial harmony that I had absorbed since my earliest childhood. And they contrasted sharply with <em>Life</em> ’s own prevailing assumptions about 1950s America as a nation “up to its ears in domestic tranquility.” Contradictions like these and the denial on which they fed pushed me to question the assumptions of the world around me and the lessons I had been taught. I resented what I began to perceive as the blindness or even bad faith of those who had misled me. This generated the tone of indignation and surprise in a letter I wrote to President Dwight Eisenhower—“Mr. Eisenhower,” I called him—on three-holed notebook paper in 1957. “I am nine years old and I am white, but I have many feelings about segregation,” the letter began—so I discovered when I found the letter years later in the Eisenhower presidential archives, in Abilene, Kansas. “Please Mr. Eisenhower,” I entreated, “Please try and have schools and other things accept colored people.” How could I have not known why my school was all white? How could I have been taught about the ideals of American democracy and Christian love when such terrible injustices did not just exist but were so vigorously defended, often by the very same people mouthing civic and religious pieties?<br><br> <em>Life</em> was not merely recounting a distant past. In nearly every issue during the mid-1950s, the magazine confronted readers—in shocking photographs as well as words—with a new set of outrages, events never mentioned by my parents or teachers. Stories depicted the murder of Emmet Till in 1955, the lynching of Mack Parker in 1959, and the assaults on Black students seeking to integrate schools in Little Rock, Charlotte, Greenville—and even in the Virginia county adjacent to ours. In <em>Life</em> ’s pages, I encountered Black boys and girls close to my own age, including a number seeking to attend schools not far from my own home. I could see Black children, sometimes even younger than I was, bravely facing angry mobs as they seized a right I could simply take for granted.<br><br> <em>Life</em> had shown me photographs of Hungarian children risking their lives in the 1956 revolution, thousands of miles away. Books had introduced me to “girls who dared” in other eras and other places. But now children of my generation, children in my state of Virginia, were creating their own heroic stories. It was not the Montgomery Bus Boycott or the Mack Parker lynching or the 1957 Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom in Washington—all of which were fully reported on in <em>Life</em> —that moved me to write to Eisenhower. It was school integration. I identified and empathized with these girls and boys. In many ways, the civil-rights movement of the 1950s and &#39;60s originated as a children&#39;s crusade, a designation later explicitly used by civil-rights leaders when children—some as young as 6 or 7—filled the streets and jails of Birmingham, Alabama, in the summer of 1963. Half a decade earlier, the courage of such young people seeking justice had both inspired me and filled me with a sobering sense of responsibility.<br><br> What I was reading was more than stories. This was about how it might be possible—and even necessary—to live a life.<br><br> <em>This article was adapted from Drew Gilpin Faust&#39;s book,</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/necessary-trouble-growing-up-at-midcentury-drew-gilpin-faust/9780374601805?affiliate_id=atl-347">Necessary Trouble</a> <em>, published this month by Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux.</em><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/life-magazine-1950s-america/675004/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/life-magazine-1950s-america/675004/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Other Black Justice on the Supreme Court]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Thirty years after his death, Thurgood Marshall&#39;s ideas still resonate. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/W4dmIh1pBl9GLOIQepzrXFs85dM=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/OtherBlackJustice/original.jpg" alt="Illustration depicting juxtaposed pictures of Clarence Thomas and Ketanji Brown Jackson in first plane, and pictures of Thurgood Marshall on second plane" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by The Atlantic.

It was his argument for affirmative action&#39;s constitutionality nearly 50 years ago that set the foundation for all subsequent legal debate on the issue.<br><br> In my five decades as a journalist, I&#39;ve had the privilege of speaking with both Marshall and Thomas about their philosophies of law and how the law should address racial inequality, and a biography I wrote, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/thurgood-marshall-american-revolutionary-juan-williams/9780812932997?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Thurgood Marshall: American Revolutionary</em></a> , is now celebrating its 25th year. I hear Marshall&#39;s voice resounding in the two dissenting opinions in this summer&#39;s affirmative-action decision, one from Jackson and the other from the only Latina Supreme Court justice, Sonia Sotomayor.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/court-ketanji-brown-jackson-knew/627096/">Linda Greenhouse: The court Ketanji Brown Jackson knew</a><br><br> Jackson and Sotomayor built their opinions on Marshall&#39;s position—that affirmative action is a compelling national interest, necessary to fostering a successful, racially diverse society. Marshall <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/438/265/#F4/1">argued</a> that racial preferences for minorities were legally permissible on the grounds that the Constitution previously granted preferences to the white majority while leaving enslaved Black people “deprived of all legal rights.”<br><br> Sotomayor and Jackson lost, 6–3; Thomas was joined by the five white conservatives on the Court. Among justices of color, however, Thomas was the lone standout, with both Sotomayor and Jackson against him—and Marshall, too, if his abiding presence could have voted.<br><br> W <span class="smallcaps">hen considering</span> the first affirmative-action case, <em>Regents of University of California v. Bakke</em> , in 1978, Marshall wrote a memo to his all-white colleagues telling them to stop debating whether instances of Black achievement meant that Black people had “arrived.” That argument was a waste of time, he said, citing a <em>US News &amp; World Report</em> list of 83 leading Americans. He pointed out that “not one Negro, even as a would-be runner-up,” was on the list.<br><br> When I once asked him about the idea that affirmative action should help all disadvantaged students, including poor white people, Marshall told me, “There&#39;s not a white man in this country who can say, &#39;I never benefited by being white.&#39;”<br><br> Marshall failed to get his fellow justices to allow 16 seats at the Davis School of Medicine to be reserved for academically qualified minority students. The white majority ruled that doing so would amount to a racial quota and was unconstitutional. But Marshall got them to agree that it was legal to consider the race of an applicant in an effort to create a more diverse campus.<br><br> In all subsequent challenges to affirmative action, the high court had to contend with Marshall&#39;s premise. The justices had to face the fact that the Constitution that had previously allowed for slavery also made room, under the Fourteenth Amendment&#39;s equal-protection clause, for legal steps to remedy the original harm.<br><br> His argument was persuasive enough to hold until this year, when Thomas&#39;s view—that affirmative action was never needed to repair past racial wrongs—won out.<br><br> Jackson&#39;s rejection of Thomas&#39;s argument against affirmative action noticeably got under the senior Black justice&#39;s skin. The depth of emotion involved for Thomas was evident in his decision to read his concurring opinion aloud in front of his fellow justices for the first time in his three decades on the bench. “Treating anyone differently based on skin color is oppression,” Thomas said. In his opinion, he went on to confront Jackson in personal terms, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_l6gn.pdf">writing</a> , “As she sees things, we are all inexorably trapped in a fundamentally racist society, with the original sin of slavery and the historical subjugation of black Americans still determining our lives today.” He later added, “Justice Jackson uses her broad observations about statistical relationship between race and select measures of health, wealth, and well-being to label all blacks as victims. Her desire to do so is unfathomable to me.”<br><br> As Melissa Murray, an NYU law professor, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/us/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson.html">put it</a> to <em>The New York Times</em> , Thomas sounded like “a Black elder chiding and chastising an errant Young Turk who … failed to show sufficient deference. It&#39;s almost as if he expects racial solidarity” from Jackson.<br><br> Thomas seems to have an emotional investment in turning Jackson away from Marshall. He has long felt that affirmative action stigmatized Black people, in schools and in professional life. He feels that because of affirmative action, white people view their Black peers as less qualified and even less intelligent.<br><br> “If I ever … [took a race-related job], my career would be irreparably ruined,” Thomas <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/02/a-question-of-fairness/306370/">told me</a> in 1980, ironically before taking a job as the leader of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. “The monkey would be on my back to prove that I didn&#39;t have the job because I&#39;m Black. People meeting me for the first time would automatically dismiss my thinking as second-rate.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/02/a-question-of-fairness/306370/">From the February 1987 issue: A question of fairness</a><br><br> He saw white condescension as a lifelong insult to all Black people. And he wanted Jackson to join him in condemning affirmative action as part of that insult, because in his mind, it inherently denied Black people&#39;s equal intellect and discipline.<br><br> The sharpest point of Thomas&#39;s argument was that white people&#39;s only obligation to Black people was to follow “the law”—as he sees it—and ensure that the constitutional protection of equal rights is now in place. He never spoke to losses, compounded over generations, in education, jobs, social capital, and opportunities to grow family wealth. He dedicated much of his 58-page concurrence to dismissing such factors as having no basis in law.<br><br> In an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1987/02/a-question-of-fairness/306370/">interview</a> for <em>The Atlantic</em> years ago, Thomas told me a story from his childhood about a blackjack game in which one player was discovered to be a cheater. At that point, figuring out who had been cheated and who had legitimately lost their money was beyond reason, he said. The only way for the game to go on was for everyone to agree to stop cheating—that would make it a level playing field.<br><br> Thomas&#39;s argument is rooted in the defiant Black-nationalist tradition of Booker T. Washington, Marcus Garvey, and Malcolm X, his heroes. In his famous “Atlanta Compromise” speech, Washington backed the idea of Blacks and whites remaining socially segregated, “separate as the fingers,” so they could continue to do business. When a white liberal asked Malcolm X what she could do to help Black progress, he famously said, “Nothing.”<br><br> Thomas similarly argued that Black people could demonstrate their abilities only if white people got out of their way, and stopped pursuing programs such as affirmative action. However, the big difference between Thomas and most Black nationalists is that he assures whites that they have no responsibility for the history of slavery and continued bias.<br><br> Thomas directly expressed disdain for Jackson, condemning her citation of statistically different outcomes for Blacks and whites as an attempt “to label all blacks as victims.” She would put Black people in a “seemingly perpetual inferior caste,” he argued.<br><br> Jackson did not buy it. She responded in a footnote to her dissent that it is Thomas, not she, who “demonstrates an obsession with race consciousness that far outstrips my [argument] … that race can be a factor that affects applicants&#39; unique life experiences.”<br><br> In keeping with Justice Marshall&#39;s thinking, she wrote that Thomas was essentially locked in a mirrored hall of racial distortion. She said he was asking Americans to look away from “the elephant in the room—the race-linked disparities that continue to impede achievement of our Nation&#39;s full potential.” Jackson argued that allowing colleges to consider the race of applicants has “universal benefits” in helping promote equality.<br><br> As for Thomas&#39;s claim that affirmative action resulted in all Black people being labeled as victims, Jackson said that such logic failed because it “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/opinion/ketanji-brown-jackson-blink.html">blinks</a> both history and reality in ways too numerous to count … Our country has never been colorblind.”<br><br> Justice Sotomayor joined Jackson by saying from the bench that Thomas was making a wrongheaded argument. “Ignoring race will not equalize a society that is racially unequal,” she said. “What was true in the 1860s, and again in 1954, is true today: Equality requires acknowledgement of inequality.”<br><br> That fits with years of arguments by Marshall. The late justice dissented from the part of the majority opinion in <em>Bakke</em> that refused to embrace a more expansive view of affirmative action, which would have allowed for quotas: “It must be remembered that during most of the past 200 years, the Constitution as interpreted by this Court did not prohibit the most ingenious and pervasive forms of discrimination against the Negro. Now when the state acts to remedy the effects of that legacy of discrimination, I cannot believe that this same Constitution stands as a barrier.” Still, Marshall&#39;s logic allowed for consideration of race—until this year&#39;s decision.<br><br> L <span class="smallcaps">ong before</span> he came to the Court, Thomas argued that equality was not to be confused with integration.<br><br> In a 1987 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/howlj30&amp;div=69&amp;id=&amp;page=">article</a> in the <em>Howard Law Journal</em> , Thomas argued that in the unanimous 1954 <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> decision outlawing school segregation, the Court had erred by ruling on the basis of sociological claims that classroom segregation created, as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/brown-v-board-of-education#:~:text=Separate%20educational%20facilities%20are%20inherently,guaranteed%20by%20the%20Fourteenth%20Amendment.">decision</a> put it, a “feeling of inferiority” among Black students and therefore was “inherently unequal.” Instead, he said, <em>Brown</em> should have turned to the “first principles of liberty and equality,” as exemplified in Justice John Marshall Harlan&#39;s dissent in the 1896 decision <em>Plessy v. Ferguson</em> . The focus on school integration, he said, had led the nation into decades of “petty squabbling over &#39;quotas,&#39; &#39;affirmative action,&#39; and race-conscious remedies for social ills.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/09/deconstructing-clarence-thomas/594775/">From the September 2019 issue: Deconstructing Clarence Thomas</a><br><br> This was straight out of the Black-nationalist playbook. Alexander Crummell, a Black nationalist, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/rbc/lcrbmrp/t0e02/t0e02.pdf">wrote</a> in 1875 that white people will “be forced to forget all the facts and theories of race when they behold our thorough equality with them, in all lines of activities and attainment, of culture and moral grandeur.” Similarly, the leader of the Nation of Islam, Elijah Muhammad, once criticized Marshall&#39;s legal appeals for racial integration as demeaning to Black people.<br><br> When Marshall won the landmark <em>Brown</em> decision as a lawyer before the Court, Muhammad condemned him for “seeking [a] closer relationship between the slaves and their master [which will lead to] total destruction of the Negroes by the wise, old slave master&#39;s children … Thurgood Marshall does not care for the recognition of his kind or for the Black Nation. He is in love with the white race. He hates the preaching of the uplifting of the Black Nation unless it is approved by the white race.”<br><br> Using the same logic as the Nation of Islam&#39;s leader, the future Justice Thomas contended that the NAACP, with Marshall as its advocate, should have asked the Court for quality education for all children, not for integration.<br><br> I once raised Thomas&#39;s argument to Justice Marshall himself. I had just finished a <em>Washington Post</em> <em>Magazine</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/1990/01/07/marshalls-law/eea56d1a-2dd6-48e3-b6de-2493e66d25d2/">profile</a> of Marshall and made a return visit to his chambers at the Court. This was 1990, and big-city schools, more than 30 years after <em>Brown</em> , remained essentially segregated—bastions of poor Black students after white flight to suburban schools.<br><br> Nevertheless, Marshall told me that Thomas was wrong.<br><br> Marshall <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2004-05-16-0405140032-story.html">said</a> he had argued for racial integration of schools to force white school boards, white mayors, and white governors to provide equally for all schools—because white children could be in all schools. He was not working for a picture of smiling Black and white children in the classroom, he said. But in his view, having Black children and white children in the same classroom was the only way to ensure that they had the same educational opportunities.<br><br> The two Black justices never debated the issue face-to-face. But Thomas never stopped wanting to win against the man he replaced on the Court. In this most recent battle over the issue, he especially, it seemed to me, wanted to win Jackson&#39;s support for his side of the debate to show the world, and especially the world of Black people, that he was right. He appears to long for affirmation from Black people, who he feels have been separated from him by white liberal critics. He once <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/499401-juan-williams-justice-thomas-seizes-his-moment-in-the-trump-era/">told</a> me that when he met with a Black student group and outlined his conservative positions to lift up Black America, the meeting ended with a young Black man telling him, “Man, they lied on you.” Thomas told me that story to show that when Black people see him for themselves, they give him the love and racial solidarity he so desperately seeks.<br><br> Not just Justice Jackson, but close to half of Black America agrees with Marshall&#39;s view that affirmative action&#39;s consideration of race was a legitimate tool for university admissions. According to a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/16/americans-and-affirmative-action-how-the-public-sees-the-consideration-of-race-in-college-admissions-hiring/">Pew Research Center poll</a> done this year, 47 percent of Black people supported the idea, 29 percent did not, and 24 percent were undecided.<br><br> Recently, Keith Ellison, Minnesota&#39;s attorney general, a Black man, suggested that Thomas was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/4102079-minnesota-ag-compares-clarence-thomas-to-house-slave-in-django-unchained/">comparable</a> to a character in the 2012 movie <em>Django Unchained</em> . Samuel L. Jackson plays a house slave who remains loyal to an enslaver despite witnessing his brutal cruelty against Black people. “Clarence Thomas has decided that his best personal interest is siding with the powerful … regardless of who they are going to hurt,” Ellison said. Similarly, when the Georgia Senate voted last year to build a monument to Thomas, the state&#39;s native son, the measure was opposed by Black state senators. “It&#39;s not that we have a problem that he is a conservative or a Republican,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/video/hypocrite-traitor-georgia-black-lawmakers-133000692.html">said</a> State Senator Nikki Merritt, who is Black. “We think he&#39;s a hypocrite and a traitor. It seems like white America keeps wanting to promote Justice Thomas, but we see more evidence where time and time again he subverts the struggles of Black Americans.”<br><br> Thomas, who set out to defeat Marshall, has not succeeded. The power of Marshall&#39;s voice on the current Court, in the form of Jackson&#39;s and Sotomayor&#39;s dissent, showed that Thomas&#39;s views did not carry the day with Black Americans.<br><br> Though Thomas spoke from the bench, it is Marshall&#39;s voice that still resonates.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/thurgood-marshall-clarence-thomas-black-justice-scotus/674975/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/thurgood-marshall-clarence-thomas-black-justice-scotus/674975/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Problem With ‘Centering Blackness’ in Everyday Conversations]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> On good and bad color-blindness <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Qp4jKZOJ76oF_x9lo5nx8Y0DP3I=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/blackness_language_horz/original.jpg" alt="Two speech bubbles, the profile of a person in the space where the overlap" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> The hotel was soulless, like all conference hotels. I had arrived a few hours before check-in, hoping to drop off my bags before I met a friend for lunch. The employees were clearly frazzled, overwhelmed by the sudden influx of several hundred impatient academics. When I asked where I could put my luggage, the guy at the front desk simply pointed to a nearby hallway. “Wait over there with her; he&#39;s coming back.”<br><br> Who “he” was remained unclear, but I saw the woman he was referring to. She was white and about my age. She had a conference badge and a large suitcase that she was rolling back and forth in obvious exasperation. “Been waiting long?” I asked, taking up a position on the other side of the narrow hallway. “ <i>Very</i> ,” she replied. For a while, we stood in silence, minding our phones. Eventually, we began chatting.<br><br> The conversation was wide-ranging: the papers we were presenting, the bad A/V at the hotel, our favorite things to do in the city. At some point, we began talking about our jobs. She told me that— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/upshot/academic-job-crisis-phd.html">like so many academics</a> —she was juggling a temporary teaching gig while also looking for a tenure-track position.<br><br> “It&#39;s hard,” she said, “too many classes, too many students, too many papers to grade. No time for your own work. Barely any time to apply to <i>real</i> jobs.”<br><br> When I nodded sympathetically, she asked about my job and whether it was tenure-track. I admitted, a little sheepishly, that it was.<br><br> “I&#39;d love to teach at a small college like that,” she said. “I feel like none of my students wants to learn. It&#39;s exhausting.”<br><br> Then, out of nowhere, she said something that caught me completely off guard: “But I shouldn&#39;t be complaining to you about this. I know <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/10/21/scholars-talk-about-being-black-campus-2020">how hard</a> BIPOC faculty have it. You&#39;re the last person I should be whining to.”<br><br> I was taken aback, but I shouldn&#39;t have been. It was the kind of awkward comment I&#39;ve grown used to over the past few years, as “anti-racism” has become the reigning ideology of progressive political culture. Until recently, calling attention to a stranger&#39;s race in such a way would have been considered a social faux pas. That she made the remark without thinking twice—a remark, it should be noted, that assumes being a Black tenure-track professor is <i>worse</i> than being a marginally employed white one—shows how profoundly interracial social etiquette has changed since 2020&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/16/902179773/summer-of-racial-reckoning-the-match-lit">“summer of racial reckoning.”</a> That&#39;s when anti-racism—focused on combating “color-blindness” in both policy and personal conduct—grabbed ahold of the liberal mainstream.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/tyre-nichols-death-memphis-george-floyd-police-reform/672986/">Wesley Lowery: Why there was no racial reckoning</a><br><br> Though this “reckoning” brought increased public attention to the deep embeddedness of racism in supposedly color-blind American institutions, it also made instant celebrities of a number of race experts and “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) consultants who believe that being anti-racist means undergoing a<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gsb-sites.stanford.edu/anti-racism-and-allyship/">“journey”</a> of radical personal transformation. In their righteous crusade against the bad color-blindness of policies such as race-neutral college admissions, these contemporary anti-racists have also jettisoned the kind of <i>good</i> color-blindness that holds that we are more than our race, and that we should conduct our social life according to that idealized principle. Rather than balance a critique of color-blind law and policy with a continuing embrace of interpersonal color-blindness as a social etiquette, contemporary anti-racists throw the baby out with the bathwater. In place of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/actually-color-blindness-isnt-racist">the old color-blind ideal</a> , they have foisted upon well-meaning white liberals a successor social etiquette predicated on the necessity of foregrounding racial difference rather than minimizing it.<br><br> As a Black guy who grew up in a politically purple area—where being a good person meant adhering to the kind of civil-rights-era color-blindness that is now passé—I find this emergent anti-racist culture jarring. Many of my liberal friends and acquaintances now seem to believe that being a good person means constantly reminding Black people that you are aware of their Blackness. Difference, no longer to be politely ignored, is insisted upon at all times under the guise of acknowledging “positionality.” Though I am rarely made to feel excessively aware of my race when hanging out with more conservative friends or visiting my hometown, in the more liberal social circles in which I typically travel, my race is constantly invoked—“acknowledged” and “centered”—by well-intentioned anti-racist “allies.”<br><br> This “acknowledgement” tends to take one of two forms. The first is the song and dance in which white people not-so-subtly let <i>you</i> know that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/opinion/not-a-racist.html"><i>they</i> know that race and racism exist</a> . This includes finding ways to interject discussion of some (bad) news item about race or racism into casual conversation, apologizing for having problems while white (“You&#39;re the last person I should be whining to”), or inversely, offering “support” by attributing any normal human problem <i>you</i> have to racism.<br><br> The second way good white liberals often “center” racial difference in everyday interactions with minorities is by trying, always clumsily, to ensure that their “marginalized” friends and familiars are “culturally” comfortable. My favorite personal experiences of this include an acquaintance who invariably steers dinner or lunch meetups to Black-owned restaurants, and the time that a friend of a friend invited me over to go swimming in their pool before apologizing for assuming that I know how to swim (“I know that&#39;s a culturally specific thing”). It is a peculiar quirk of the 2020s&#39; racial discourse that this kind of “acknowledgement” and “centering” is viewed as progress.<br><br> My point is not that conservatives have better racial politics— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/08/07/opinion/florida-board-education-slavery-nazism/">they do not</a> —but rather that something about current progressive racial discourse has become warped and distorted. The anti-racist culture that is ascendant seems to me to have little to do with combatting structural racism or cultivating better relationships between white and Black Americans. And its rejection of color-blindness as a social ethos is not a new frontier of radical political action.<br><br> No, at the core of today&#39;s anti-racism is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/15/black-lives-matter-george-floyd-protests-policy-change/">little more than a vibe shift</a> —a soft matrix of conciliatory gestures and hip phraseology that give adherents the <i>feeling</i> that there has been a cultural change, when in fact we have merely put carpet over the rotting floorboards. Although this push to center rather than sidestep racial difference in our interpersonal relationships comes from a good place, it tends to rest on a troubling, even racist subtext: that white and Black Americans are so radically different that interracial relationships require careful management, constant eggshell-walking, and even expert guidance from professional anti-racists. Rather than producing racial harmony, this new ethos frequently has the opposite effect, making white-Black interactions stressful, unpleasant, or, perhaps most often, simply weird.<br><br> Since the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, progressive anti-racism has centered on two concepts that helped Americans make sense of his senseless death: “structural racism” and “implicit bias.” The first of these is a sociopolitical concept that highlights how certain institutions— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/12/upshot/child-maternal-mortality-rich-poor.html">maternity wards</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/16/us/minneapolis-police-george-floyd">police barracks</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/08/25/the-secret-bias-hidden-in-mortgage-approval-algorithms">lending companies</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-settlement-race-discrimination-lawsuit-against-public-housing">housing authorities</a> , etc.—produce and replicate racial inequalities, such as the disproportionate killing of Black men by the cops. The second is a psychological<i> </i>concept that describes the way that all individuals—from bleeding-heart liberals to murderers such as Derek Chauvin—harbor varying degrees of subconscious racial prejudice.<br><br> Though “structural racism” and “implicit bias” target different scales of the social order—institutions on the one hand, individuals on the other—underlying both of these ideas is a critique of so-called color-blind ideology, or what the sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva calls “color-blind racism”: the idea that policies, interactions, and rhetoric can be explicitly race-neutral but implicitly racist. As concepts, both “structural racism” and “implicit bias” rest on the presupposition that racism is an enduring feature of institutional and social life, and that so-called race neutrality is a covertly racist myth that perpetuates inequality. Some anti-racist scholars such as Uma Mazyck Jayakumar and Ibram X. Kendi have put this even more bluntly: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/supreme-court-affirmative-action-race-neutral-admissions/674565/">“&#39;Race neutral&#39; is the new “separate but equal.&#39;”</a> Yet, although anti-racist academics and activists are <i>right</i> to argue that race-neutral policies can&#39;t solve racial inequities—that supposedly color-blind laws and policies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/colorblind-constitution/602221/">are often anything but</a> —over the past few years, this line of criticism has also been bizarrely extended to color-blindness as a <i>personal</i> ethos governing behavior at the individual level.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/colorblind-constitution/602221/">Theodore R.

Over the past three years, this kind of anti-color-blind, pro-discomfort rhetoric has become the norm in anti-racist discourse.

The problem with color-blindness, Joseph counsels, is it allows “white people to continue to be comfortable.” The NFL analyst Emmanuel Acho wrote an entire book, simply called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/uncomfortable-conversations-with-a-black-man-emmanuel-acho/9781250800473?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man</i></a> , that admonishes readers to “stop celebrating color-blindness.” And, of course, there are endless <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/real-friends-talk-about-race-yseult-p-mukantabanahannah-summerhill?variant=40582692667426"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/real-friends-talk-about-race-bridging-the-gaps-through-uncomfortable-conversations-yseult-p-mukantabana/9780778387053?affiliate_id=atl-347">how-to guides</a> for having these “uncomfortable conversations” with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://katiecouric.com/lifestyle/relationships/how-to-talk-about-racism/">your Black friends</a> .<br><br> Once the dominant progressive ideology, professing “I don&#39;t see color” is now viewed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danabrownlee/2022/06/19/dear-white-people-when-you-say-you-dont-see-color-this-is-what-we-really-hear/?sh=b4c50c726d60">as a kind of dog whistle</a> that papers over implicit bias. Instead, current anti-racist wisdom holds that we must acknowledge racial difference in our interactions with others, rather than assume that race needn&#39;t be at the center of every interracial conversation or encounter. Coming to grips with the transition we have undergone over the past decade—color-blind etiquette&#39;s swing from de rigueur to racist—requires a longer view of an American cultural transition. Civil-rights-era color-blindness was replaced with an individualistic, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/how-to-build-an-anti-racist-company">corporatized anti-racism</a> , one focused on the purification of white psyches through racial discomfort, guilt, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/07/protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-wokeness/">“doing the work”</a> as a road to self-improvement.<br><br> Writing in 1959, the social critic Philip Rieff argued that postwar America was transforming from a religious and economic culture—one oriented around common institutions such as the church and the market—to a <i>psychological</i> culture, one oriented around the self and its emotional fulfillment. By the 1960s, Rieff had given this shift a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Therapeutic-Background-Essential-Conservative/dp/1932236805">name</a> : “the triumph of the therapeutic,” which he defined as an emergent worldview according to which the “self, improved, is the ultimate concern of modern culture.” Yet, even as he diagnosed our culture with self-obsession, Rieff also noticed something peculiar and even paradoxical. Therapeutic culture demanded that we reflect our self-actualization <i>outward</i> . Sharing our innermost selves with the world—good, bad, and ugly—became a new social mandate under the guise that authenticity and open self-expression are necessary for social cohesion.<br><br> Recent anti-racist mantras like “White silence is violence” reflect this same sentiment: exhibitionist displays of “racist” guilt are viewed as a necessary precursor to racial healing and community building. In this way, today&#39;s attacks on interpersonal color-blindness—and progressives&#39; growing fixation on implicit bias, public confession, and race-conscious social etiquette—are only the most recent manifestations of the cultural shift Rieff described. Indeed, the seeds of the current backlash against color-blindness began decades ago, with the application of a New Age, therapeutic outlook to race relations: so-called racial-sensitivity training, the forefather of today&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/antiracism-training-white-fragility-robin-diangelo-ibram-kendi.html">equally spurious</a> DEI programming.<br><br> In her 2001 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/race-experts-how-racial-etiquette-sensitivity-training-and-new-age-therapy-hijacked-the-civil-rights-revolution-elisabeth-lasch-quinn/9780742527591?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Race Experts</i></a> , the historian Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn painstakingly details how racial-sensitivity training emerged from the 1960s&#39; human-potential movement and its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/encounter-movement-a-fad-last-decade-finds-new-shape-tried-by.html">infamous “encounter groups.”</a> As she explains, what began as a more or less countercultural phenomenon was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-radical-history-of-corporate-sensitivity-training#:~:text=It%2520was%2520born%2520amid%2520the,fears%252C%2520biases%252C%2520and%2520emotions.">later corporatized</a> in the form of the anemic, pointless workshops <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/comedy-central-caves-cancel-culture-removes-episode-office-line-1623873">controversially lampooned on <i>The Office</i></a> . Not surprisingly, this shift <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ideas.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Anand-Winters-2008.pdf">reflected the ebb and flow of corporate interests</a> : Whereas early workplace training emphasized compliance with the newly minted Civil Rights Act of 1964, later incarnations would focus on improving employee relations and, later still, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hbr.org/2022/06/stop-making-the-business-case-for-diversity">leveraging diversity</a> to secure <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/biancamillercole/2020/09/15/8-reasons-why-diversity-and-inclusion-are-essential-to-business-success/?sh=2c9d53581824">better business outcomes</a> .<br><br> If there is something distinctive about the anti-color-blind racial etiquette that has emerged since George Floyd&#39;s death, it is that these sites of encounter have shifted from official institutional spaces to more intimate ones where white people and minorities interact as friends, neighbors, colleagues, and acquaintances. Racial-awareness raising is a dynamic no longer quarantined to formalized, compulsory settings like the boardroom or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2963111">freshman orientation</a> . Instead, every interracial interaction is a potential scene of (one-way) racial edification and supplication, encounters in which good white liberals are expected to be transparent about their “positionality,” confront their “whiteness,” and—if the situation calls for it—confess their “implicit bias.”<br><br> In a vacuum, many of the prescriptions advocated by the anti-color-blind crowd are reasonable: We <i>should</i> all think more about our privileges and our place in the world. An uncomfortable conversation or an honest look in the mirror <i>can be</i> precursors to personal growth. We <i>all</i> carry around harmful, implicit biases and we <i>do</i> need to examine the subconscious assumptions and prejudices that underlie the actions we take and the things we say. My objection is not to these ideas themselves, which are sensible enough. No, my objection is that anti-racism offers little more than a Marie Kondo–ism for the white soul, promising to declutter racial baggage and clear a way to white fulfillment without doing anything meaningful to combat structural racism. As Lasch-Quinn correctly foresaw, “Casting interracial problems as issues of etiquette [puts] a premium on superficial symbols of good intentions and good motivations as well as on style and appearance rather than on the substance of change.”<br><br> Yet the problem with the therapeutics of contemporary anti-racism is not just that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Antiracism.html">they are politically sterile</a> . When anti-color-blindness and its ideology of insistent “race consciousness” are translated into the sphere of private life—to the domain of friendships, block parties, and backyard barbecues—they assault the very idea of a multiracial society, producing new forms of racism in the process. The fact that our media environment is inundated with an endless stream of books, articles, and social-media tutorials that promise to teach white people how to simply <i>interact</i> with the Black people in their life is not a sign of anti-racist progress, but of profound regression.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/dei-training-initiatives-consultants-companies-skepticism/674237/">Conor Friedersdorf: The DEI industry needs to check its privilege</a><br><br> The subtext that undergirds this new anti-racist discourse—that Black-white relationships are inherently fraught and must be navigated with the help of professionals and technical experts—testifies to the impoverishment of our interracial imagination, not to its enrichment. More gravely, anti-color-blind etiquette treats Black Americans as exotic others, permanent strangers whose racial difference is so chasmic that it must be continually managed, whose mode of humanness is so foreign that it requires white people to adopt a special set of manners and “race conscious” ritualistic practices to even have a simple conversation.<br><br> If we are going to find a way out of the racial discord that has defined American life post-Trump and post-Charlottesville and post-Floyd, we have to begin with a more sophisticated understanding of color-blindness, one that rejects the bad color-blindness on offer from the Republican Party and its partisans, as well as the <i>anti</i> -color-blindness of the anti-racist consultants. Instead, we should embrace the good color-blindness of not too long ago. At the heart of <i>that</i> color-blindness was a radical claim, one imperfectly realized but perfect as an ideal: that despite the weight of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88478467">a racist past that isn&#39;t even past</a> , we can imagine a world, or at least an interaction between two people, where racial difference doesn&#39;t make a difference.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/anti-racist-color-blindness-dei-programs/674996/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/anti-racist-color-blindness-dei-programs/674996/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Greatest Act of Greenwashing in American History]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A new chronicle of redwood logging exposes how a cadre of wealthy industrialists reaped a fortune in the name of environmentalism. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/PWfwW2bU-OoNP9ZHmqDfQDMeQVo=/0x0:2160x2700/648x810/media/img/2023/08/11/redwood/original.jpg" alt="红杉" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Delaney Allen</figcaption></figure> I <span class="smallcaps">n 1934, an industrialist</span> and obsessive book collector named A. Edward Newton <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1934/01/a-tourist-in-san-francisco/651802/">wrote an article</a> for <i>The Atlantic</i> recounting a trip he had recently taken to see the ancient redwoods of Northern California. He had traveled by night train to the timber town of Scotia, then by motor car up into the quiet, fog-draped forest. When he finally arrived, Newton did what most writers do when faced with some of the tallest trees on Earth: He experienced a wave of awe, his brain short-circuited, and then he resorted to cliché. In the article, he likens the massive trees to “stone columns in a cathedral.” Then he quotes a line of verse from William Cullen Bryant (who was cribbing, in turn, from Pliny the Elder): “The groves were God&#39;s first temples.” Very large and very old trees tend to have this effect on us—they deepen our souls but impoverish our wits. We can&#39;t quite make sense of them.<br><br> The owner of that ancient forest, the Pacific Lumber Company, had recently battled with conservationists over the right to cut down a nearby swath of old-growth redwoods called Bull Creek Flat. Newton, briefly outlining this conflict in the article, seems torn between his newfound love of the redwoods, which he now regarded as “personal friends,” and his “friends of the Pacific Lumber Company,” who had “a duty toward their stockholders.” Naturally, he was relieved that a compromise had recently been struck: A cadre of wealthy individuals, most notably John D. Rockefeller Jr., had donated millions of dollars to purchase 9,000 acres of old-growth land and fold it into an existing state park. “It was a long pull and a strong pull and a pull all together, but the thing after ten years was done,” Newton writes. “The redwoods were saved and the world is the richer therefor.”<br><br> The author was, it probably goes without saying, wrong: The old-growth redwoods were not saved, at least not in the sense that most people today would interpret that phrase. Yes, some exemplary antique redwoods were protected in museumlike groves, but elsewhere, the majority of the old-growth-redwood ecosystem was rapidly vanishing. More worrying still, it turned out that the trees were not truly protected even in “protected” areas. This fact came thundering home in the winter of 1955, when a flood washed away a clear-cut hillside above Bull Creek Flat—the very forest Newton had deemed “saved”—killing hundreds of giant trees. The notion that we could preserve a few old redwoods without also safeguarding their ecosystem was revealed to be a cruel fantasy.<br><br> As Greg King demonstrates in his groundbreaking new book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-ghost-forest-racists-radicals-and-real-estate-in-the-california-redwoods-greg-king/9781541768673?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Ghost Forest: Racists, Radicals, and Real Estate in the California Redwoods</i></a> ,<i> </i>the history of redwood conservation—and, perhaps, the history of environmentalism itself—is a never-ending series of tempting illusions and hard-won revelations. For more than a century, as loggers continued to raze entire groves that predated the birth of Christopher Columbus (and some that predated the birth of Christ), the public was continually reassured that the trees were in the process of being, or <i>had already been,</i> “saved.”<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n the mid-1980s,</span> while working as a young newspaper reporter, King stumbled across timber companies&#39; plans to cut down the nation&#39;s largest unprotected stands of old-growth redwoods. (One of those forests just happened to be a short walk from his house.) After talking with state regulators—who struck him as apathetic and ecologically misinformed—and visiting the horror show of fresh clear-cuts, he decided to quit his job, hop across the thin inky line between journalism and activism, and join the fight to save the redwoods. In the five years that followed, King climbed high into the branches of trees that were slated to be felled; he organized rallies where he was repeatedly attacked by loggers (King hit back); and, once, he was arrested for scaling the Golden Gate Bridge in order to hang a banner reading <span class="smallcaps">SAVE THIS PLANET</span> . (His friends faced even graver risks: One of his fellow organizers, Judi Bari, was the victim of both a bombing and an attempt by the FBI <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jun/12/duncancampbell.oliverburkeman">to frame her</a> <i>for transporting that very bomb</i> .)<br><br> If handled poorly, a history of the so-called Redwood Wars—especially when told by one of the aging activists who took part in it—could seem a bit narrow, almost quaint. (Our most urgent environmental concerns these days tend to be planetary and structural, rather than local and sylvan.) King brilliantly avoids this pitfall by expanding the scope of his book. The real story he wants to tell is an epic tale of corruption and deception, perpetrated on a mass scale for nearly a century, of which his crusade constitutes only a few chapters.<br><br> The early history of industrial redwood logging is one of outright theft: Under lax laws such as the Timber and Stone Act, which was intended to encourage new small-scale logging and mining operations, large companies routinely purchased redwood forests at steep discounts by pretending they would be used by individual homesteaders. All told, millions of acres of valuable land were stolen in this fashion.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1901/09/hunting-big-redwoods/544044/">Read: Hunting big redwoods</a><br><br> However, King adds a crucial missing piece to this oft-told history; he explains <i>why</i> that land was so valuable. Before the widespread use of steel, redwood lumber was not just any old wood. It was the very bones of industrial capitalism, at the precise moment in the 19th century when the Golden State was undergoing a growth spurt. Redwood lumber was the principal building material for entire cities, including San Francisco; it provided the most durable ties for the nascent railroad industry; and, perhaps most importantly, it could be fashioned into rot-resistant pipelines and tanks to store and transport water and petroleum. Many of these applications (especially the pipelines) required a specific type of redwood timber—the kind that could be found only in the oldest trees. But strangely, King uncovers, many of the moguls who most needed that rare lumber were the same ones who were supposedly campaigning to “save” the redwoods.<br><br> The most startling section of King&#39;s book concerns his research into the history of the venerable Save the Redwoods League—a conservation group founded in 1918 by, and for a long time largely managed by, wealthy industrialists and prominent eugenicists (the “racists” of the book&#39;s subtitle). Digging through a newly accessible archive containing the league&#39;s private documents, King reports that throughout their history, rather than attempting to preserve large tracts of wild land, as they purported to do, its early members mainly focused on buying up “beauty strips” of old-growth redwoods alongside roadways and railways, which hid the sight of the other trees being liquidated. They repeatedly brokered deals that paid logging companies exorbitant amounts of money for their land—sometimes as much as four times above the estimated market value—and on at least one occasion arrived just in the nick of time to save a lumber company from bankruptcy. Meanwhile, they actively campaigned against other conservation groups who were pushing to protect larger, more intact pieces of wilderness. In doing so, King argues, the league gave industrialists exactly what they wanted: It mollified public outcry while simultaneously guaranteeing industry&#39;s access to nature&#39;s riches. Readers familiar with Eleanor Catton&#39;s new novel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/04/birnam-wood-eleanor-catton-book-review/673668/"><i>Birnam Wood</i></a> ;<i> </i>David O. Russell&#39;s film <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vO6EKe8gVXk"><i>I Heart Huckabees</i></a> ;<i> </i>or, really, any oil-industry ad campaign already know how this feat of corporate sleight of hand works. What&#39;s astonishing, in the league&#39;s case, is its duration and success. King dubs its efforts to be “the first, the largest, and the longest-lasting example” of “greenwashing” in history.<br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">f course, as an activist-historian,</span> King has learned to deftly wield illusion to his own ends as well. He elides important shifts in paradigms, such as that from classic conservationism to biocentric preservation and ecological restoration (the difference, in other words, between saving redwoods for their lumber and beauty and saving them for their own sake). He is quick to brand the league with the neat stamp of corruption, when a murkier desire for what seemed like win-win compromises was likely often at play, and he undersells its biggest accomplishments, such as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://lostcoastoutpost.com/2023/apr/22/the-three-telegrams-rohde/">truly Herculean effort</a> to save Bull Creek Flat. The book is also markedly light on self-examination; there is scant mention of any missteps by King and his fellow North Coast activists, nor any exploration of their (by most accounts, refreshingly labor-friendly and nuanced) environmental philosophy. For a more scholarly and evenhanded account of this same history, Darren Frederick Speece&#39;s book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/defending-giants-the-redwood-wars-and-the-transformation-of-american-environmental-politics-darren-frederick-speece/9780295745732?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Defending Giants: The Redwood Wars and the Transformation of American Environmental Politics</i></a> , is worth reading. However, I suspect that most readers will prefer King&#39;s rendition, which, though slanted, glints with a cold, sharp light.<br><br> Near its end, the tone of the book shifts to one of bittersweet ambivalence. In 1999, in a deal brokered in part by Save the Redwoods League, which was still wielding power nearly a century after its founding, the federal government paid almost half a billion dollars to the Pacific Lumber Company in exchange for just 3,000 acres of old-growth forest, which was set aside in the newly designated <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/headwaters-opens-up-the-public-will-soon-be-2942826.php">Headwaters Forest Reserve</a> , as well as an additional 4,000 acres of previously logged land to act as a buffer. Though nominally a victory for King and his allies, the deal was a mere fraction of the 60,000 acres they felt were needed to protect the ecosystem. The combination of new federal and state regulations, court rulings, and public pressure over the past two decades has made the clear-cutting of ancient redwoods (mostly) a thing of the past. But the great dream of preservationists—a complete, protected watershed of ancient redwood giants—was never achieved, anywhere, and now never will be.<br><br> Meanwhile, climate change has begun <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.savetheredwoods.org/what-we-do/our-work/study/understanding-climate-change/">threatening</a> the old-growth redwoods, which rely on now-inconsistent amounts of fog and rain. (Ironically enough, King writes, some of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.savetheredwoods.org/blog/new-research-illuminates-climate-vulnerability-and-resilience-of-worlds-tallest-trees/">the best research</a> into the effects of climate change on the redwoods in recent years has been funded by none other than Save the Redwoods League—a last-minute grace note for an organization that he has just finished carving apart at the joints.) In the end, after reading more than 400 pages of detailed history, fierce commentary, and taut storytelling, I came away from <i>The Ghost Forest</i> oddly, but—given the book&#39;s spectral title, fittingly—mystified. Are the redwoods safe at last? Or, I wondered, are they merely apparitions, remnants of the past, soon to vanish in the new, harsh light of tomorrow?<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/redwoods-protection-conservation-history/675003/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/redwoods-protection-conservation-history/675003/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel’s Democracy Movement Has Something Important to Teach Us]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Rejecting moralistic hectoring in favor of democratic patriotism, Israel&#39;s protest movement appeals to a people&#39;s sense of what their country can and should be. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/hixQatsLMjFoJDW8GJW5ArpAGOQ=/0x0:8640x4860/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/AP23199604737725/original.jpg" alt="Israeli protesters are silhouetted against a darkening sky waving several Israeli flags and an American flag." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Oded Balilty / AP</figcaption></figure> The left in the US hasn&#39;t shown much love for the democracy movement that has rocked Israel since January. Such indifference is, perhaps, unsurprising, because many progressives consider Israel to be a—if not the—force for evil in the world. At its recent convention, the Democratic Socialists of America put forward a resolution titled “Make DSA an Anti-Zionist Organization in Principle and Praxis,” and the <em>Harvard Crimson</em> editorial board has “proudly” endorsed a campus protest that equated Zionism with “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2022/6/25/schneider-israel-wall-of-resistance/">white supremacy</a> ,” among other ills. Even many liberals, including Jewish ones, seem oddly disconnected from the events that are unfolding; in the United States, demonstrations against the Netanyahu government have been insignificant and mainly confined to small left-Zionist groups.<br><br> Some critics <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/19/opinion/israel-democracy-protests.html">insist</a> that Israel isn&#39;t a real democracy because Arab Israelis face discrimination, or because Israel was founded as a state of refuge for the Jewish people, or because the occupation persists. Underlying this view is an oddly moralistic, rather than political, understanding of democracy that confuses it with purity. Democracy—the rule of law, the equality of citizenship, the balance of governmental powers, the freedom to speak and publish, the protection of minorities, the sanctity of elections, the ability to be religious or secular—can be, and in fact usually is, partial and incomplete. Democracies have been known, and not just occasionally, to embark on odious wars, support oppressive institutions, and sustain colonialism; see, for instance, France when it ruled Algeria. The difference is that Israel&#39;s colony—the West Bank—abuts it, rather than being a thousand miles away.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-judicial-reform-and-protests-netanyahu/674849/">Matti Friedman: After 30 years in Israel, I see my country differently</a><br><br> Despite the purists&#39; claims, the unfolding events in Israel are, in fact, an extraordinary example of what democracy in the streets looks like.

Tech firms have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/business/tech-startups-israel.html">threatened</a> to leave the country.

Shockingly, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/this-is-where-we-draw-the-line-10000-more-reservists-to-stop-volunteering/">thousands of reservists</a> , including pilots and members of the elite fighting units, have threatened to withhold their service.

All of this activity dwarfs anything we saw in the United States during the Donald Trump years, despite the anti-Trump forces&#39; self-flattering description of themselves as “the Resistance” and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/05/20/opinion/blm-george-floyd-mural.html">now-dashed hope</a> that Black Lives Matter could create a sustainable, genuinely mass movement. A bit of humility would be apt.<br><br> The mainstream press in the United States, both print and broadcast, has been covering events in Israel. (So have Al Jazeera and Hezbollah&#39;s Al-Manar, which keeps an eye on what it calls “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://english.almanar.com.lb/1884742">the Zionist entity</a> .”) In the US, Israel is sometimes <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/07/14/the-jerusalem-u-s-israel-strategic-partnership-joint-declaration/">depicted</a> as a country that is just like us—a puny sister democracy with shared values—or, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/americanization-israeli-palestinian-debate-blm/618967/">alternatively</a> , as a country so different from ours that we can&#39;t possibly understand it. Both of these have an element of truth, but each—like the blind men and the elephant—misses the complexity of the situation. And though much of the coverage has focused on the so-called judicial reform, the crisis in Israel extends far beyond that to the very essence of the country&#39;s identity, or multiple identities, and its fissures, which have been decades in the making.<br><br> Israel is not engaged in a conflict merely over legal proposals. As the Israeli journalist Gershom Gorenberg told me, to call the crux of the crisis “judicial overhaul” is like calling the war in Ukraine a special military operation. What&#39;s at stake is whether Israel will remain a modern, liberal democracy—albeit one with grievous defects—or become a dictatorial theocracy, joining the other failed states of the Middle East. That transformation would resonate far outside Israel; the <em>New York Times</em> columnist Thomas Friedman recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/28/opinion/netanyahu-israel-palestinians-courts.html">wrote</a> that if Ukraine and Israeli democracy go down in defeat, “the whole world would tip the wrong way.”<br><br> Events in Israel do have parallels to those in other countries. As in France and Italy, the once powerful social-democratic left in Israel has shrunk and lost its working-class base. As in Turkey, India, and the United States, radical religious extremists have obtained enormous political power. Ominous parallels between Netanyahu and Trump are especially obvious. Each is a shameless liar who appeals to religious conservatives despite well-known sex scandals <strong>.</strong> Each has declared war on the rule of law, governmental balance of powers, and their county&#39;s elites. Each sees himself as a victim. Each threatens his country&#39;s national security. Each has tried to fracture the cohesion of his multiethnic country through base appeals to racism, ethnic hatred, and presumed grievances. (Unhappily, Slobodan Milošević also comes to mind.) Each has intimidated the once-sane voices within his own party. Each is desperately trying to stay out of jail.<br><br> And though both men pose as ultranationalists, both are prime examples of what the Israeli journalist Alon Pinkas has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-11/ty-article/.highlight/netanyahus-legacy-being-israels-first-post-zionist-prime-minister/00000189-4503-dc58-adcd-fda7ff980000">called</a> the “psycho-political phenomenon” of oikophobia: “a person&#39;s aversion to their home, environment or country.” (Pinkas argues that Netanyahu is essentially an anti-Zionist.) Each has declared war on the country he despises and is happy to see it disintegrate, even in bloodshed, if that is the price of remaining in power.<br><br> But these similarities, though real, can be misleading. Israel is a very different place from the United States (or Western Europe). And the differences, not the similarities, are the key to the Israeli movement&#39;s strength—and to what we can learn from it.<br><br> The United States is a sprawling country. I&#39;ve lived here all my life but have never visited the majority of states. I don&#39;t, I admit, feel too connected to many people in Idaho or Arkansas—except on Election Night, when I resentfully watch their vote tabulations. America is a powerhouse that dwarfs its neighbors, and indeed much of the world. Being apolitical here is easy, if you so choose. I worry a lot about our country&#39;s future, especially these days, but I don&#39;t doubt its continued existence.<br><br> In contrast, Israel is a tiny, claustrophobic country. It is hemmed in by neighbors that, for much of its existence, have tried to destroy it (when you&#39;re there, it&#39;s a bit unnerving to see how close Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan are). It has been existentially challenged since the day it declared independence. It is the target of Iran, a large and powerful country whose leadership is enthusiastically dedicated to its destruction. Israelis do not spend their lives quaking in fear. But its security situation dictates that a very large proportion of the population, representing all political tendencies, serves in the armed forces, which is the most binding national institution; about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/29/world/middleeast/israel-reservists-judicial-overhaul.html">5 percent</a> remain in the reserves for decades. Virtually every Israeli, and every Palestinian in the occupied territories, has lost someone to war, terrorism, or military assault. Most of Israel&#39;s political sea changes, unlike those in the United States, have been the result of its wars and violent conflicts.<br><br> And, in sharp contrast to the world&#39;s other countries, Israel has no set borders. It has neither annexed nor liberated the Palestinian West Bank. It has ruled over another people, who are kept stateless, rights-less, and under violent military dictatorship, for 56 years. So yes, Israel is different.<br><br> An equally significant difference, though, is in the relationship that Israelis have to the state and to one another. In the United States, we focus, sometimes obsessively, on rights. Rights are undeniably crucial. But they aren&#39;t everything. We Americans pay far less attention to the concept of responsibility: of democracy as a dialectic among government, civil society, and citizens. When I ask my students—smart, empathetic, caring young people—what they feel they owe our country, they usually come up blank. But in Israel, as Gorenberg told me, “The social contract is very demanding. There is no tradition of the rugged individual, of American libertarianism; that&#39;s really foreign to us. This is a society that was created with a sense of the collective: The state is supposed to provide a lot, and we&#39;re supposed to provide a lot. The government is violating that”—hence the widespread feeling of anger and betrayal.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/israeli-palestinian-conflict-ferguson/620471/">Susie Linfield: Palestine isn&#39;t Ferguson</a><br><br> In the <em>Times of Israel</em> , the journalist Yossi Klein Halevi <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-wounded-jewish-psyche-and-the-divided-israeli-soul/">wrote</a> :<br><br><p> Over and over, protesters tell interviewers variations on the same story: I&#39;m doing this for my father who was wounded in the Yom Kippur War, for my son who was killed in Lebanon, for my grandparents who were uprooted from Iraq or who survived the Holocaust, for my great-grandparents who helped build the state. Now, they say, it&#39;s my turn to defend the country.</p> That shared social contract has enabled the Israeli movement to be so capacious; it has even incorporated some Likudniks, some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-02-17/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/these-settlers-are-joining-israels-pro-democracy-protest-movement-heres-what-it-means/00000186-5b13-d22b-ad9e-7f732d5d0000">settlers</a> , and some of the religiously observant, who constitute much of Netanyahu&#39;s base. The ideological breadth of the Israeli movement is almost impossible to imagine in the United States, where one needs to sign on to a host of positions—regarding, among other things, immigration; policing; diversity, equity, and inclusion; transgender rights; and yes, hatred of Israel—in order to be welcomed into the progressive camp. Indeed, our parameters of acceptable debate seem to narrow rather than expand. In contrast, the Israeli movement has dispensed with litmus tests; people who disagree—a lot—about crucial issues are marching side by side. One of the main protest organizations in Jerusalem refers to its mission as “protecting the shared home.”<br><br> Like the country itself, the Israeli democracy movement is radically imperfect. A mass movement doesn&#39;t include everyone (although recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-06-15/ty-article/netanyahus-coalition-loses-majority-if-elections-held-today-polls-find/00000188-c02c-d7cb-afcd-d82ea2780000">polls</a> show that the Netanyahu coalition would fall if an election were held today). Divisions between Ashkenazi and Sephardim, between the central cities and the poorer periphery, are deep. Few Arab Israelis are taking part, though they are more imperiled than Jewish Israelis by the governing coalition&#39;s plans. (In February, 200 prominent Arab Israelis <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/first-to-be-harmed-arab-israeli-leaders-sign-petition-against-judicial-overhaul/">released a statement</a> urging Arab citizens to participate in the protests: “A regime change is taking place that will affect the lives of all citizens … and the Arab public will be the first victim,” they wrote.) And despite its wide tent, the movement is, in some sense, dominated by the elite.<br><br> But the elite in Israel is different from ours: Silicon Valley software engineers and leftist academics rarely fight in America&#39;s wars. In contrast, as Halevi pointed out, Israel&#39;s “elites are not only &#39;privileged&#39; but sacrificial.” In any case, as the historian Anita Shapira recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-22/ty-article-magazine/.highlight/will-religious-extremists-bring-israel-down-again/00000189-7528-de6d-a1ef-f5eaeee00000">wrote</a> , “&#39;Elite&#39; is not a dirty word. A country cannot exist without elites. In the weekly mass demonstrations … a large measure of popular strength is also visible.”<br><br> The brutal occupation is Israel&#39;s central, but often unacknowledged, moral and political catastrophe—one that underlies all others and points to two simultaneous, confounding truths. First, Israel can&#39;t rid itself of its racism, ultranationalism, and religious fanaticism until the occupation ends. Ayman Odeh, the head of the predominantly Arab Hadash-Ta&#39;al Party, put the point succinctly when he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/opinion/2023-06-04/ty-article-opinion/how-long-can-the-judicial-overhaul-protests-ignore-israeli-occupation-for/00000188-8344-d952-af9f-b75f31720000">addressed</a> “the dear demonstrators on Kaplan Street” in <em>Haaretz</em> : “The occupation is the umbilical cord of Israeli fascism.” Second, the occupation won&#39;t (and some, even on the left, say can&#39;t) end tomorrow. The upshot is that, paradoxically, the defense of democracy can&#39;t wait for its precondition to emerge. Some Israelis, hopefully a growing number, recognize this conundrum. But they also know that a partial, even drastically defective democracy is categorically different from a dictatorship.<br><br> Most important, Israel&#39;s protest movement has rejected moralistic hectoring in favor of democratic patriotism. It appeals to a people&#39;s sense of what their country can and should be, rather than fostering guilt and shame.<br><br> Democratic patriotism isn&#39;t alien to the United States. On the contrary, it&#39;s been the basis of our best—and, arguably, most successful—movements. Think of the abolitionists, who rejected slavery—a worldwide institution that had existed for several millennia—as a betrayal of our country&#39;s essential principles; of the militant, interracial union movement from the 1930s to 1950s, which insisted that fair worker compensation and labor rights were the American way; of the early civil-rights movement, which, though originally emanating from the Black churches of the South, appealed to fellow Americans not on the basis of Christian values but on those of shared citizenship.<br><br> The departure from this ethos came in the &#39;60s, when the more radical segment of the anti–Vietnam War movement, in understandable anger and frustration, represented itself not only as an opponent of a deeply immoral war but of “AmeriKKKa” itself. (Carrying Vietcong flags did not go over well with the working-class people whose sons were dying in the Mekong Delta.) More recently, the anti-racist movement that has emerged from Black Lives Matters often paints the United States as founded on, and eternally stamped by, a desolate fusion of “original sin,” racist “DNA,” and genocide.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/american-liberals-israel-protests-patriotism/673540/">Gal Beckerman: What American liberals can learn from Israel&#39;s protests</a><br><br> The Israelis, in contrast, have unashamedly put themselves forth as patriots: They are organizing <em>for</em> the country, which means for their neighbors, not against it or them. They have seized the flag back from the racist hooligans who terrorize local Palestinians in Jerusalem in the annual flag parade. They have refused to be intimidated by the right&#39;s traditional accusations of treason. They have proudly declared that democracy <em>is</em> patriotism, and vice versa.<br><br> In short, the Israeli movement is a model for what it means to despise your government but to love your country. It shows that creating a welcoming sense of civic identity—open to all who prize democracy rather than to an enlightened few—is the sine qua non of a mass movement. This is the Israelis&#39; gift to us, and their lesson—one that I hope we can learn, not for their sake but for ours.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/israel-democracy-protests-2023-netanyahu-occupation/674977/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/israel-democracy-protests-2023-netanyahu-occupation/674977/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How America Got Mean]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> In a culture devoid of moral education, generations are growing up in a morally inarticulate, self-referential world. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ErwHrDisYTvej8Qd9FpdaGlQsAI=/0x157:3000x1845/1440x810/media/img/2023/07/24/0923_WEL_Brooks_MoralCollapseOpener/original.jpg" alt="Mirror shards arranged in the shape of the United States, reflecting a tree and the sky" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">, Monday through Friday.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small><br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">ver the past</span> eight years or so, I&#39;ve been obsessed with two questions. The first is: Why have Americans become so sad? The rising rates of depression have been well publicized, as have the rising deaths of despair from drugs, alcohol, and suicide. But other statistics are similarly troubling. The percentage of people who say they don&#39;t have close friends has increased fourfold since 1990. The share of Americans ages 25 to 54 who weren&#39;t married or living with a romantic partner went up to 38 percent in 2019, from 29 percent in 1990. A record-high 25 percent of 40-year-old Americans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/28/a-record-high-share-of-40-year-olds-in-the-us-have-never-been-married/">have never married</a> . More than half of all Americans say that no one knows them well. The percentage of high-school students who report “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness” shot up from 26 percent in 2009 to 44 percent in 2021.<br><br> My second, related question is: Why have Americans become so mean? I was recently talking with a restaurant owner who said that he has to eject a customer from his restaurant for rude or cruel behavior once a week—something that never used to happen. A head nurse at a hospital told me that many on her staff are leaving the profession because patients have become so abusive. At the far extreme of meanness, hate crimes rose in 2020 to their highest level in 12 years. Murder rates have been surging, at least until recently. Same with gun sales. Social trust is plummeting. In 2000, two-thirds of American households gave to charity; in 2018, fewer than half did. The words that define our age reek of menace: <i>conspiracy</i> , <i>polarization</i> , <i>mass shootings</i> , <i>trauma</i> , <i>safe spaces</i> .<br><br> We&#39;re enmeshed in some sort of emotional, relational, and spiritual crisis, and it undergirds our political dysfunction and the general crisis of our democracy. What is going on?<br><br> Over the past few years, different social observers have offered different stories to explain the rise of hatred, anxiety, and despair.<br><br> <i>The technology story:</i> Social media is driving us all crazy.<br><br> <i>The sociology story:</i> We&#39;ve stopped participating in community organizations and are more isolated.<br><br> <i>The demography story:</i> America, long a white-dominated nation, is becoming a much more diverse country, a change that has millions of white Americans in a panic.<br><br> <i>The economy story:</i> High levels of economic inequality and insecurity have left people afraid, alienated, and pessimistic.<br><br> I agree, to an extent, with all of these stories, but I don&#39;t think any of them is the deepest one. Sure, social media has bad effects, but it is everywhere around the globe—and the mental-health crisis is not. Also, the rise of despair and hatred has engulfed a lot of people who are not on social media. Economic inequality is real, but it doesn&#39;t fully explain this level of social and emotional breakdown. The sociologists are right that we&#39;re more isolated, but why? What values lead us to choose lifestyles that make us lonely and miserable?<br><br> The most important story about why Americans have become sad and alienated and rude, I believe, is also the simplest: We inhabit a society in which people are no longer trained in how to treat others with kindness and consideration. Our society has become one in which people feel licensed to give their selfishness free rein. The story I&#39;m going to tell is about morals. In a healthy society, a web of institutions—families, schools, religious groups, community organizations, and workplaces—helps form people into kind and responsible citizens, the sort of people who show up for one another. We live in a society that&#39;s terrible at moral formation.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/pandemic-american-shoppers-nightmare/619650/">Read: American shoppers are a nightmare</a><br><br> Moral formation, as I will use that stuffy-sounding term here, comprises three things. First, helping people learn to restrain their selfishness. How do we keep our evolutionarily conferred egotism under control? Second, teaching basic social and ethical skills. How do you welcome a neighbor into your community? How do you disagree with someone constructively? And third, helping people find a purpose in life. Morally formative institutions hold up a set of ideals. They provide practical pathways toward a meaningful existence: <i>Here&#39;s how you can dedicate your life to serving the poor, or protecting the nation, or loving your neighbor.</i><br><br> For a large part of its history, America was awash in morally formative institutions. Its Founding Fathers had a low view of human nature, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-51-60">designed the Constitution to mitigate it</a> (even while validating that low view of human nature by producing a document rife with racism and sexism). “Men I find to be a Sort of Beings very badly constructed,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-37-02-0277">Benjamin Franklin wrote</a> , “as they are generally more easily provok&#39;d than reconcil&#39;d, more dispos&#39;d to do Mischief to each other than to make Reparation, and much more easily deceiv&#39;d than undeceiv&#39;d.”<br><br> If such flawed, self-centered creatures were going to govern themselves and be decent neighbors to one another, they were going to need some training. For roughly 150 years after the founding, Americans were obsessed with moral education. In 1788, Noah Webster wrote, “The <i>virtues</i> of men are of more consequence to society than their <i>abilities</i> ; and for this reason, the <i>heart</i> should be cultivated with more assiduity than the <i>head</i> .” The progressive philosopher John Dewey wrote in 1909 that schools teach morality “every moment of the day, five days a week.” Hollis Frissell, the president of the Hampton Institute, an early school for African Americans, declared, “Character is the main object of education.” As late as 1951, a commission organized by the National Education Association, one of the main teachers&#39; unions, stated that “an unremitting concern for moral and spiritual values continues to be a top priority for education.”<br><br> The moral-education programs that stippled the cultural landscape during this long stretch of history came from all points on the political and religious spectrums. School textbooks such as <i>McGuffey&#39;s Eclectic Readers</i> not only taught students how to read and write; they taught etiquette, and featured stories designed to illustrate right and wrong behavior. In the 1920s, WEB Du Bois&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2022/08/w-e-b-dubois-and-the-brownies-book/">magazine for Black children</a> , <i>The Brownies&#39; Book</i> , had a regular column called “The Judge,” which provided guidance to young readers on morals and manners. There were thriving school organizations with morally earnest names that sound quaint today—the Courtesy Club, the Thrift Club, the Knighthood of Youth.<br><br> Beyond the classroom lay a host of other groups: the YMCA; the Sunday-school movement; the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts; the settlement-house movement, which brought rich and poor together to serve the marginalized; Aldo Leopold&#39;s land ethic, which extended our moral concerns to include proper care for the natural world; professional organizations, which enforced ethical codes; unions and workplace associations, which, in addition to enhancing worker protections and paychecks, held up certain standards of working-class respectability. And of course, by the late 19th century, many Americans were members of churches or other religious communities. Mere religious faith doesn&#39;t always make people morally good, but living in a community, orienting your heart toward some transcendent love, basing your value system on concern for the underserved—those things tend to.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/kindness-happiness-negative-feedback/673862/">Arthur C. Brooks: Make yourself happy—be kind</a><br><br> An educational approach with German roots that was adopted by Scandinavian societies in the mid-to-late 19th century had a wide influence on America. It was called <i>Bildung</i> , roughly meaning “spiritual formation.” As conceived by Wilhelm von Humboldt, the <i>Bildung</i> approach gave professors complete freedom to put moral development at the center of a university&#39;s mission. In schools across Scandinavia, students studied literature and folk cultures to identify their own emotions, wounds, and weaknesses, in order to become the complex human beings that modern society required. Schools in the <i>Bildung</i> tradition also aimed to clarify the individual&#39;s responsibilities to the wider world—family, friends, nation, humanity. Start with the soul and move outward.<br><br> The <i>Bildung</i> movement helped inspire the Great Books programs that popped up at places like Columbia and the University of Chicago. They were based on the conviction that reading the major works of world literature and thinking about them deeply would provide the keys to living a richer life. Meanwhile, discipline in the small proprieties of daily existence—dressing formally, even just to go shopping or to a ball game—was considered evidence of uprightness: proof that you were a person who could be counted on when the large challenges came.<br><br> Much of American moral education drew on an ethos expressed by the headmaster of the Stowe School, in England, who wrote in 1930 that the purpose of his institution was to turn out young men who were “acceptable at a dance and invaluable in a shipwreck.” America&#39;s National Institute for Moral Instruction was founded in 1911 and published a “Children&#39;s Morality Code,” with 10 rules for right living. At the turn of the 20th century, Mount Holyoke College, an all-women&#39;s institution, was an example of an intentionally thick moral community. When a young Frances Perkins was a student there, her Latin teacher detected a certain laziness in her. She forced Perkins to spend hours conjugating Latin verbs, to cultivate self-discipline. Perkins grew to appreciate this: “For the first time I became conscious of character.” The school also called upon women to follow morally ambitious paths. “Do what nobody else wants to do; go where nobody else wants to go,” the school&#39;s founder implored. Holyoke launched women into lives of service in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. Perkins, who would become the first woman to serve in a presidential Cabinet (Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s), was galvanized there.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/students-broken-moral-compasses/492866/">Read: Students&#39; broken moral compasses</a><br><br> These various approaches to moral formation shared two premises. The first was that training the heart and body is more important than training the reasoning brain. Some moral skills can be taught the way academic subjects are imparted, through books and lectures. But we learn most virtues the way we learn crafts, through the repetition of many small habits and practices, all within a coherent moral culture—a community of common values, whose members aspire to earn one another&#39;s respect.<br><br> The other guiding premise was that concepts like justice and right and wrong are not matters of personal taste: An objective moral order exists, and human beings are creatures who habitually sin against that order. This recognition was central, for example, to the way the civil-rights movement in the 1950s and early 1960s thought about character formation. “Instead of assured progress in wisdom and decency man faces the ever present possibility of swift relapse not merely to animalism but into such calculated cruelty as no other animal can practice,” Martin Luther King Jr. believed. Elsewhere, he wrote, “The force of sinfulness is so stubborn a characteristic of human nature that it can only be restrained when the social unit is armed with both moral and physical might.”<br><br> At their best, the civil-rights marchers in this prophetic tradition understood that they could become corrupted even while serving a noble cause. They could become self-righteous because their cause was just, hardened by hatred of their opponents, prideful as they asserted power. King&#39;s strategy of nonviolence was an effort simultaneously to expose the sins of their oppressors and to restrain the sinful tendencies inherent in themselves. “What gave such widely compelling force to King&#39;s leadership and oratory,” the historian George Marsden argues, “was his bedrock conviction that moral law was built into the universe.”<br><br> A couple of obvious things need to be said about this ethos of moral formation that dominated American life for so long. It prevailed alongside all sorts of hierarchies that we now rightly find abhorrent: whites superior to Blacks, men to women, Christians to Jews, straight people to gay people. And the emphasis on morality didn&#39;t produce perfect people. Moral formation doesn&#39;t succeed in making people angels—it tries to make them better than they otherwise might be.<br><br> Furthermore, we would never want to go back to the training methods that prevailed for so long, rooted in so many <i>thou shall not</i> s and so much shaming, and riddled with so much racism and sexism. Yet a wise accounting should acknowledge that emphasizing moral formation meant focusing on an important question—what is life for?—and teaching people how to bear up under inevitable difficulties. A culture invested in shaping character helped make people resilient by giving them ideals to cling to when times got hard. In some ways, the old approach to moral formation was, at least theoretically, egalitarian: If your status in the community was based on character and reputation, then a farmer could earn dignity as readily as a banker. This ethos came down hard on self-centeredness and narcissistic display. It offered practical guidance on how to be a good neighbor, a good friend.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">And then</span> it mostly went away.<br><br> The crucial pivot happened just after World War II, as people wrestled with the horrors of the 20th century. One group, personified by the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, argued that recent events had exposed the prevalence of human depravity and the dangers, in particular, of tribalism, nationalism, and collective pride. This group wanted to double down on moral formation, with a greater emphasis on humility.<br><br> Another group, personified by Carl Rogers, a founder of humanistic psychology, focused on the problem of authority. The trouble with the 20th century, the members of this group argued, was that the existence of rigid power hierarchies led to oppression in many spheres of life. We need to liberate individuals from these authority structures, many contended. People are naturally good and can be trusted to do their own self-actualization.<br><br> After decades without much in the way of moral formation, America became a place where 74 million people looked at Donald Trump&#39;s morality and saw presidential timber.<br><br> A cluster of phenomenally successful books appeared in the decade after World War II, making the case that, as Rabbi Joshua Loth Liebman wrote in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/peace-of-mind-insights-on-human-nature-that-can-change-your-life-joshua-l-liebman/9780806514963?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Peace of Mind</i></a> (1946), “thou shalt not be afraid of thy hidden impulses.” People can trust the goodness inside. His book topped the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list for 58 weeks. Dr. Spock&#39;s first child-rearing manual was published the same year. That was followed by books like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking-10-traits-for-maximum-results-norman-vincent-peale/9780743234801?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i></a> (1952). According to this ethos, morality is not something that we develop in communities. It&#39;s nurtured by connecting with our authentic self and finding our true inner voice. If people are naturally good, we don&#39;t need moral formation; we just need to let people get in touch with themselves. Organization after organization got out of the moral-formation business and into the self-awareness business. By the mid‑1970s, for example, the Girl Scouts&#39; founding ethos of service to others had shifted: “How can you get more in touch with <i>you</i> ? What are <i>you</i> thinking? What are <i>you</i> feeling?” one Girl Scout handbook asked.<br><br> Schools began to abandon moral formation in the 1940s and &#39;50s, as the education historian B. Edward McClellan chronicles in <i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/moral-education-in-america-schools-and-the-shaping-of-character-from-colonial-times-to-the-present-b-edward-mcclellan/9780807738207?affiliate_id=atl-347">Moral Education in America</a></i> : “By the 1960s deliberate moral education was in full-scale retreat” as educators “paid more attention to the SAT scores of their students, and middle-class parents scrambled to find schools that would give their children the best chances to qualify for elite colleges and universities.” The postwar period saw similar change at the college level, Anthony Kronman, a former dean of Yale Law School, has noted. The “research ideal” supplanted the earlier humanistic ideal of cultivating the whole student. As academics grew more specialized, Kronman has argued, the big questions—What is the meaning of life? How do you live a good life?—lost all purchase. Such questions became unprofessional for an academic to even ask.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/the-benefits-of-character-education/275585/">Read: The benefits of character education</a><br><br> In sphere after sphere, people decided that moral reasoning was not really relevant. Psychology&#39;s purview grew, especially in family and educational matters, its vocabulary framing “virtually all public discussion” of the moral life of children, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/storage/app/uploads/public/58e/1a4/f58/58e1a4f58adfb826575976.pdf">James Davison Hunter, a prominent American scholar on character education, noted in 2000</a> . “For decades now, contributions from philosophers and theologians have been muted or nonexistent.” Psychology is a wonderful profession, but its goal is mental health, not moral growth.<br><br> From the start, some worried about this privatizing of morality. “If what is good, what is right, what is true is only what the individual &#39;chooses&#39; to &#39;invent,&#39; ” Walter Lippmann wrote in his 1955 collection, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-public-philosophy-walter-lippmann/9780887387913?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Essays in the Public Philosophy</i></a> , “then we are outside the traditions of civility.” His book was hooted down by establishment figures such as the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.; the de-moralization of American culture was under way.<br><br> Over the course of the 20th century, words relating to morality appeared less and less frequently in the nation&#39;s books: According to a 2012 paper, usage of a cluster of words related to being virtuous also declined significantly. Among them were <i>bravery</i> (which dropped by 65 percent), <i>gratitude</i> (58 percent), and <i>humbleness</i> (55 percent). For decades, researchers have asked incoming college students about their goals in life. In 1967, about 85 percent said they were strongly motivated to develop “a meaningful philosophy of life”; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.heri.ucla.edu/PDFs/pubs/TFS/Norms/Monographs/TheAmericanFreshman2000.pdf">by 2000, only 42 percent said that</a> . Being financially well off became the leading life goal; by 2015, 82 percent of students said wealth was their aim.<br><br> In a culture devoid of moral education, generations grow up in a morally inarticulate, self-referential world. The Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith and a team of researchers asked young adults across the country in 2008 about their moral lives. One of their findings was that the interviewees had not given the subject of morality much thought. “I&#39;ve never had to make a decision about what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong,” one young adult told the researchers. “My teachers avoid controversies like that like the plague,” many teenagers said.<br><br> The moral instincts that Smith observed in his sample fell into the pattern that the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre called “emotivism”: <i>Whatever feels good to me is moral.</i> “I would probably do what would make me happy” in any given situation <b>,</b> one of the interviewees declared. “Because it&#39;s me in the long run.” As another put it, “If you&#39;re okay with it morally, as long as you&#39;re not getting caught, then it&#39;s not really against your morals, is it?” Smith and his colleagues emphasized that the interviewees were not bad people but, because they were living “in morally very thin or spotty worlds,” they had never been given a moral vocabulary or learned moral skills.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Most of us</span> who noticed the process of de-moralization as it was occurring thought a bland moral relativism and empty consumerism would be the result: <i>You do you and I&#39;ll do me.</i> That&#39;s not what happened.<br><br> “Moral communities are fragile things, hard to build and easy to destroy,” the psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-righteous-mind-why-good-people-are-divided-by-politics-and-religion-jonathan-haidt/9780307455772?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Righteous Mind</i></a> . When you are raised in a culture without ethical structure, you become internally fragile. You have no moral compass to give you direction, no permanent ideals to which you can swear ultimate allegiance. “He who has a <i>why</i> to live for can bear with almost any <i>how</i> ,” the psychiatrist (and Holocaust survivor) Viktor Frankl wrote, interpreting a famous Nietzsche saying. Those without a <i>why</i> fall apart when the storms hit. They begin to suffer from that feeling of moral emptiness that Émile Durkheim called “anomie.”<br><br> Expecting people to build a satisfying moral and spiritual life on their own by looking within themselves is asking too much. A culture that leaves people morally naked and alone leaves them without the skills to be decent to one another. Social trust falls partly because more people are untrustworthy. That creates crowds of what psychologists call “vulnerable narcissists.” We all know grandiose narcissists—people who revere themselves as the center of the universe. Vulnerable narcissists are the more common figures in our day—people who are also addicted to thinking about themselves, but who often feel anxious, insecure, avoidant. Intensely sensitive to rejection, they scan for hints of disrespect. Their self-esteem is wildly in flux. Their uncertainty about their inner worth triggers cycles of distrust, shame, and hostility.<br><br> “The breakdown of an enduring moral framework will always produce disconnection, alienation, and an estrangement from those around you,” Luke Bretherton, a theologian at Duke Divinity School, told me. The result is the kind of sadness I see in the people around me. Young adults I know are spiraling, leaving school, moving from one mental-health facility to another. After a talk I gave in Oklahoma, a woman asked me, “What do you do when you no longer want to be alive?” The very next night I had dinner with a woman who told me that her brother had died by suicide three months before. I mentioned these events to a group of friends on a Zoom call, and nearly half of them said they&#39;d had a brush with suicide in their family. Statistics paint the broader picture: Suicide rates have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/index.html">increased by more than 30 percent</a> since 2000, according to the CDC.<br><br> Sadness, loneliness, and self-harm turn into bitterness. Social pain is ultimately a response to a sense of rejection—of being invisible, unheard, disrespected, victimized. When people feel that their identity is unrecognized, the experience registers as an injustice—because it is. People who have been treated unjustly often lash out and seek ways to humiliate those who they believe have humiliated them.<br><br> Even as our public life has grown morally bare, people yearn to feel respected and worthy of respect, need to feel that their life has some moral purpose and meaning.<br><br> Lonely eras are not just sad eras; they are violent ones. In 19th-century America, when a lot of lonely young men were crossing the western frontier, one of the things they tended to do was shoot one another. As the saying goes, pain that is not transformed gets transmitted. People grow more callous, defensive, distrustful, and hostile. The pandemic made it worse, but antisocial behavior is still high even though the lockdowns are over. And now we are caught in a cycle, ill treatment leading to humiliation and humiliation leading to more meanness. Social life becomes more barbaric, online and off.<br><br> If you put people in a moral vacuum, they will seek to fill it with the closest thing at hand. Over the past several years, people have sought to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/collapsing-levels-trust-are-devastating-america/616581/">fill the moral vacuum</a> with politics and tribalism. American society has become hyper-politicized.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/collapsing-levels-trust-are-devastating-america/616581/">David Brooks: America is having a moral convulsion</a><br><br> According to research by Ryan Streeter, the director of domestic-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, lonely young people are seven times more likely to say they are active in politics than young people who aren&#39;t lonely. For people who feel disrespected, unseen, and alone, politics is a seductive form of social therapy. It offers them a comprehensible moral landscape: The line between good and evil runs not down the middle of every human heart, but between groups. Life is a struggle between us, the forces of good, and them, the forces of evil.<br><br> The Manichaean tribalism of politics appears to give people a sense of belonging. For many years, America seemed to be awash in a culture of hyper-individualism. But these days, people are quick to identify themselves by their group: Republican, Democrat, evangelical, person of color, LGBTQ, southerner, patriot, progressive, conservative. People who feel isolated and under threat flee to totalizing identities.<br><br> Politics appears to give people a sense of righteousness: A person&#39;s moral stature is based not on their conduct, but on their location on the political spectrum. You don&#39;t have to be good; you just have to be liberal—or you just have to be conservative. The stronger a group&#39;s claim to victim status, the more virtuous it is assumed to be, and the more secure its members can feel about their own innocence.<br><br> Politics also provides an easy way to feel a sense of purpose. You don&#39;t have to feed the hungry or sit with the widow to be moral; you just have to experience the right emotion. You delude yourself that you are participating in civic life by feeling properly enraged at the other side. That righteous fury rising in your gut lets you know that you are engaged in caring about this country. The culture war is a struggle that gives life meaning.<br><br> Politics overwhelms everything. Churches, universities, sports, pop culture, health care are swept up in a succession of battles that are really just one big war—red versus blue. Evangelicalism used to be a faith; today it&#39;s primarily a political identity. College humanities departments used to study literature and history to plumb the human heart and mind; now they sometimes seem exclusively preoccupied with politics, and with the oppressive systems built around race, class, and gender. Late-night comedy shows have become political pep rallies. Hundreds of thousands of Americans died unnecessarily during the pandemic because people saw a virus through the lens of a political struggle.<br><br> This is not politics as it is normally understood. In psychically healthy societies, people fight over the politics of distribution: How high should taxes be? How much money should go to social programs for the poor and the elderly? We&#39;ve shifted focus from the politics of redistribution to the politics of recognition. Political movements are fueled by resentment, by feelings that society does not respect or recognize me. Political and media personalities gin up dramas in which our side is emotionally validated and the other side is emotionally shamed. The person practicing the politics of recognition is not trying to get resources for himself or his constituency; he is trying to admire himself. He&#39;s trying to use politics to fill the hole in his soul. It doesn&#39;t work.<br><br> The politics of recognition doesn&#39;t give you community and connection, certainly not in a system like our current one, mired in structural dysfunction. People join partisan tribes in search of belonging—but they end up in a lonely mob of isolated belligerents who merely obey the same orthodoxy.<br><br> If you are asking politics to be the reigning source of meaning in your life, you are asking more of politics than it can bear. Seeking to escape sadness, loneliness, and anomie through politics serves only to drop you into a world marked by fear and rage, by a sadistic striving for domination. Sure, you&#39;ve left the moral vacuum—but you&#39;ve landed in the pulverizing destructiveness of moral war. The politics of recognition has not produced a happy society. When asked by the General Social Survey to rate their happiness level, 20 percent of Americans in 2022 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/trends?category=Gender%20%26%20Marriage&amp;measure=happy">rated it at the lowest level</a> —only 8 percent did the same in 1990.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/">Read: What the longest study on human happiness found is the key to a good life</a><br><br> America&#39;s Founding Fathers studied the history of democracies going back to ancient Greece. They drew the lesson that democracies can be quite fragile. When private virtue fails, the constitutional order crumbles. After decades without much in the way of moral formation, America became a place where more than 74 million people looked at Donald Trump&#39;s morality and saw presidential timber.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Even in dark times,</span> sparks of renewal appear. In 2018, a documentary about Mister Rogers called <i>Won&#39;t You Be My Neighbor?</i> was released. The film showed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/what-would-mister-rogers-do/600772/">Fred Rogers in all his simple goodness</a> —his small acts of generosity; his displays of vulnerability; his respect, even reverence, for each child he encountered. People cried openly while watching it in theaters. In an age of conflict and threat, the sight of radical goodness was so moving.<br><br> In the summer of 2020, the series <i>Ted Lasso</i> premiered. When Lasso describes his goals as a soccer coach, he could mention the championships he hopes to win or some other conventional metric of success, but he says, “For me, success is not about the wins and losses. It&#39;s about helping these young fellas be the best versions of themselves on and off the field.”<br><br> That is a two-sentence description of moral formation. <i>Ted Lasso</i> is about an earnest, cheerful, and transparently kind man who enters a world that has grown cynical, amoral, and manipulative, and, episode after episode, even through his own troubles, he offers the people around him opportunities to grow more gracious, to confront their vulnerabilities and fears, and to treat one another more gently and wisely. Amid lockdowns and political rancor, it became a cultural touchstone, and the most watched show on Apple TV+.<br><br> Even as our public life has grown morally bare, people, as part of their elemental nature, yearn to feel respected and worthy of respect, need to feel that their life has some moral purpose and meaning. People still want to build a society in which it is easier to be good. So the questions before us are pretty simple: How can we build morally formative institutions that are right for the 21st century? What do we need to do to build a culture that helps people become the best versions of themselves?<br><br> Healthy moral ecologies don&#39;t just happen. They have to be seeded and tended.<br><br> A few necessities come immediately to mind.<br><br> <i>A modern vision of how to build character.</i> The old-fashioned models of character-building were hopelessly gendered. Men were supposed to display iron willpower that would help them achieve self-mastery over their unruly passions. Women were to sequester themselves in a world of ladylike gentility in order to not be corrupted by bad influences and base desires. Those formulas are obsolete today.<br><br> The best modern approach to building character is described in Iris Murdoch&#39;s book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-sovereignty-of-good-iris-murdoch/9780415854733?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Sovereignty of Good</i></a> . Murdoch writes that “nothing in life is of any value except the attempt to be virtuous.” For her, moral life is not defined merely by great deeds of courage or sacrifice in epic moments. Instead, moral life is something that goes on continually—treating people considerately in the complex situations of daily existence. For her, the essential moral act is casting a “just and loving” attention on other people.<br><br> Normally, she argues, we go about our days with self-centered, self-serving eyes. We see and judge people in ways that satisfy our own ego. We diminish and stereotype and ignore, reducing other people to bit players in our own all-consuming personal drama. But we become morally better, she continues, as we learn to see others deeply, as we learn to envelop others in the kind of patient, caring regard that makes them feel seen, heard, and understood. This is the kind of attention that implicitly asks, “What are you going through?” and cares about the answer.<br><br> I become a better person as I become more curious about those around me, as I become more skilled in seeing from their point of view. As I learn to perceive you with a patient and loving regard, I will tend to treat you well. We can, Murdoch concluded, “grow by looking.”<br><br> <i>Mandatory social-skills courses.</i> Murdoch&#39;s character-building formula roots us in the simple act of paying attention: <i>Do I attend to you well?</i> It also emphasizes that character is formed and displayed as we treat others considerately. This requires not just a good heart, but good social skills: how to listen well. How to disagree with respect. How to ask for and offer forgiveness. How to patiently cultivate a friendship. How to sit with someone who is grieving or depressed. How to be a good conversationalist.<br><br> These are some of the most important skills a person can have. And yet somehow, we don&#39;t teach them. Our schools spend years prepping students with professional skills—but offer little guidance on how to be an upstanding person in everyday life. If we&#39;re going to build a decent society, elementary schools and high schools should require students to take courses that teach these specific social skills, and thus prepare them for life with one another. We could have courses in how to be a good listener or how to build a friendship. The late feminist philosopher Nel Noddings <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://stanfordmag.org/contents/she-brought-caring-to-education-research">developed a whole pedagogy</a> around how to effectively care for others.<br><br> <i>A new core curriculum.</i> More and more colleges and universities are offering courses in what you might call “How to Live.” Yale has one called “Life Worth Living.” Notre Dame has one called “God and the Good Life.” A first-year honors program in this vein at Valparaiso University, in Indiana, involves not just conducting formal debates on ideas gleaned from the Great Books, but putting on a musical production based on their themes. Many of these courses don&#39;t give students a ready-made formula, but they introduce students to some of the venerated moral traditions—Buddhism, Judeo-Christianity, and Enlightenment rationalism, among others. They introduce students to those thinkers who have thought hard on moral problems, from Aristotle to Desmond Tutu to Martha Nussbaum. They hold up diverse exemplars to serve as models of how to live well. They put the big questions of life firmly on the table: <i>What is the ruling passion of your soul? Whom are you responsible to? What are my moral obligations? What will it take for my life to be meaningful? What does it mean to be a good human in today&#39;s world? What are the central issues we need to engage with concerning new technology and human life?</i><br><br> These questions clash with the ethos of the modern university, which is built around specialization and passing on professional or technical knowledge. But they are the most important courses a college can offer. They shouldn&#39;t be on the margins of academic life. They should be part of the required core curriculum.<br><br> <i>Intergenerational service.</i> We spend most of our lives living by the logic of the meritocracy: Life is an individual climb upward toward success. It&#39;s about pursuing self-interest.<br><br> There should be at least two periods of life when people have a chance to take a sabbatical from the meritocracy and live by an alternative logic—the logic of service: You have to give to receive. You have to lose yourself in a common cause to find yourself. The deepest human relationships are gift relationships, based on mutual care. (An obvious model for at least some aspects of this is the culture of the US military, which similarly emphasizes honor, service, selflessness, and character in support of a purpose greater than oneself, throwing together Americans of different ages and backgrounds who forge strong social bonds.)<br><br> Those sabbaticals could happen at the end of the school years and at the end of the working years. National service programs could bring younger and older people together to work to address community needs.<br><br> These programs would allow people to experience other-centered ways of being and develop practical moral habits: how to cooperate with people unlike you. How to show up day after day when progress is slow. How to do work that is generous and hard.<br><br> <i>Moral organizations.</i> Most organizations serve two sets of goals—moral goals and instrumental goals. Hospitals heal the sick and also seek to make money. Newspapers and magazines inform the public and also try to generate clicks. Law firms defend clients and also try to maximize billable hours. Nonprofits aim to serve the public good and also raise money.<br><br> In our society, the commercial or utilitarian goals tend to eclipse the moral goals. Doctors are pressured by hospital administrators to rush through patients so they can charge more fees. Journalists are incentivized to write stories that confirm reader prejudices in order to climb the most-read lists. Whole companies slip into an optimization mindset, in which everything is done to increase output and efficiency.<br><br> Moral renewal won&#39;t come until we have leaders who are explicit, loud, and credible about both sets of goals. <i>Here&#39;s how we&#39;re growing financially</i> , but also <i>Here&#39;s how we&#39;re learning to treat one another with consideration and respect; here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to forgo some financial returns in order to better serve our higher mission</i> .<br><br> Early in my career, as a TV pundit at <i>PBS NewsHour</i> , I worked with its host, Jim Lehrer. Every day, with a series of small gestures, he signaled what kind of behavior was valued there and what kind of behavior was unacceptable. In this subtle way, he established a set of norms and practices that still lives on. He and others built a thick and coherent moral ecology, and its way of being was internalized by most of the people who have worked there.<br><br> <i>Politics as a moral enterprise.</i> An ancient brand of amoralism now haunts the world. Authoritarian-style leaders like Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Xi Jinping embody a kind of amoral realism. They evince a mindset that assumes that the world is a vicious, dog-eat-dog sort of place. Life is a competition to grab what you can. Force is what matters. Morality is a luxury we cannot afford, or merely a sham that elites use to mask their own lust for power. It&#39;s fine to elect people who lie, who are corrupt, as long as they are ruthless bastards for our side. The ends justify the means.<br><br> Those of us who oppose these authoritarians stand, by contrast, for a philosophy of moral realism. Yes, of course people are selfish and life can be harsh. But over the centuries, civilizations have established rules and codes to nurture cooperation, to build trust and sweeten our condition. These include personal moral codes so we know how to treat one another well, ethical codes to help prevent corruption on the job and in public life, and the rules of the liberal world order so that nations can live in peace, secure within their borders.<br><br> Moral realists are fighting to defend and modernize these rules and standards—these sinews of civilization. Moral realism is built on certain core principles. Character is destiny. We can either elect people who try to embody the highest standards of honesty, kindness, and integrity, or elect people who shred those standards. Statecraft is soulcraft. The laws we pass shape the kinds of people we become. We can structure our tax code to encourage people to be enterprising and to save more, or we can structure the code to encourage people to be conniving and profligate. Democracy is the system that best enhances human dignity. Democratic regimes entrust power to the people, and try to form people so they will be responsible with that trust. Authoritarian regimes seek to create a world in which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.<br><br> Look, I understand why people don&#39;t want to get all moralistic in public. Many of those who do are self-righteous prigs, or rank hypocrites. And all of this is only a start. But healthy moral ecologies don&#39;t just happen. They have to be seeded and tended by people who think and talk in moral terms, who try to model and inculcate moral behavior, who understand that we have to build moral communities because on our own, we are all selfish and flawed. Moral formation is best when it&#39;s humble. It means giving people the skills and habits that will help them be considerate to others in the complex situations of life. It means helping people behave in ways that make other people feel included, seen, and respected. That&#39;s very different from how we treat people now—in ways that make them feel sad and lonely, and that make them grow unkind.<br><br> <small><i>This article appears in the</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09"><i>September 2023</i></a> <i>print edition with the headline “How America Got Mean.” When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> The escalating political struggle over abortion is compounding the GOP&#39;s challenges in the nation&#39;s largest and most economically vibrant metropolitan areas.<br><br> The biggest counties in Ohio <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-special-election-issue-1-abortion/674957/">voted last week overwhelmingly against the ballot initiative</a> pushed by Republicans and anti-abortion forces to raise the threshold for passing future amendments to the state constitution to 60 percent. That proposal, known as Issue 1, was meant to reduce the chances that voters would approve a separate initiative on the November ballot to overturn the six-week abortion ban Ohio Republicans approved in 2019.<br><br> The preponderant opposition to Issue 1 in Ohio&#39;s largest counties extended a ringing pattern. Since the Supreme Court overturned the nationwide constitutional right to abortion with its 2022 <i>Dobbs</i> decision, seven states have held ballot initiatives that allowed voters to weigh in on whether the procedure should remain legal: California, Vermont, Montana, Michigan, Kansas, Kentucky, and now Ohio. In addition, voters in Wisconsin chose a new state-supreme-court justice <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-2024-races/673567/">in a race dominated by the question of whether abortion should remain legal in the state.</a><br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-special-election-issue-1-abortion/674957/">Read: The abortion backlash reaches Ohio</a><br><br> In each of those eight contests, the abortion-rights position or candidate prevailed. And in each case, most voters in the states&#39; largest population centers have voted—usually by lopsided margins—to support legal abortion.<br><br> These strikingly consistent results underline how conflict over abortion is amplifying the interconnected geographic, demographic, and economic realignments reconfiguring American politics. Particularly since Donald Trump emerged as the GOP&#39;s national leader, Republicans have solidified their hold on exurban, small-town, and rural communities, whose populations tend to be predominantly white and Christian and many of whose economies are relian <b>t</b> on the powerhouse industries of the 20th century: manufacturing, energy extraction, and agriculture. Democrats, in turn, are consolidating their advantage inside almost all of the nation&#39;s largest metro areas, which tend to be more racially diverse, more secular, and more integrated into the expanding 21st-century Information Age economy.<br><br> New data provided exclusively to <i>The Atlantic</i> by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/programs/brookings-metro/">Brookings Metro</a> , a nonpartisan think tank, show, in fact, that the counties that voted against the proposed abortion restrictions are the places driving most economic growth in their states. Using data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis, Brookings Metro at my request calculated the share of total state economic output generated by the counties that voted for and against abortion rights in five of these recent contests. The results were striking: Brookings found that the counties supporting abortion rights accounted for more than four-fifths of the total state GDP in Michigan, more than three-fourths in Kansas, exactly three-fourths in Ohio, and more than three-fifths in both Kentucky and Wisconsin.<br><br> “We are looking at not only two different political systems but two different economies as well within the same states,” Robert Maxim, a senior research associate at Brookings Metro, told me.<br><br> The Ohio vote demonstrated again that abortion is extending the fault line between those diverging systems, with stark electoral implications. Concerns that Republicans would try to ban abortion helped Democrats perform unexpectedly well in the 2022 elections in the key swing states of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, particularly in well-educated suburbs around major cities. Democrats won four of the six governor contests and four of the five US Senate races in those states despite widespread discontent over the economy and President Joe Biden&#39;s job performance. Even if voters remain unhappy on both of those fronts in 2024, Democratic strategists are cautiously optimistic that fear of Republicans attempting to impose a national abortion ban will remain a powerful asset for Biden and the party&#39;s other candidates.<br><br> When given the chance to weigh in on the issue directly, voters in communities of all sizes have displayed resistance to banning abortion. As Philip Bump of <i>The Washington Post</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/08/09/ohio-abortion-vote-analysis/">calculated this week</a> , the share of voters supporting abortion rights exceeded Biden&#39;s share of the vote in 500 of the 510 counties that have cast ballots on the issue since last year (outside of Vermont, which Bump did not include in his analysis).<br><br> But across these states, most smaller counties still voted against legal abortion, including this last week in Ohio. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cleveland.com/politics/2023/08/ohios-issue-1-results-how-turnout-in-urban-counties-slippage-in-rurals-cost-republicans.html">A comprehensive analysis of the results by the Cleveland <i>Plain Dealer</i></a> found that in Ohio&#39;s rural counties, more than three-fifths of voters still backed Issue 1.<br><br> Opponents of Issue 1 overcame that continued resistance with huge margins in the state&#39;s largest urban and suburban counties. Most voters rejected Issue 1 in 14 of the 17 counties that cast the most ballots this week, including all seven that cast the absolute most votes ( <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/08/08/us/elections/results-ohio-issue-1.html?name=styln-2023-elections&amp;region=TOP_BANNER&amp;block=storyline_menu_recirc&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;variant=undefined">according to the ranking posted by <i>The New York Times</i></a> ). In several of those counties, voters opposed Issue 1 by ratios of 2 to 1 or even 3 to 1.<br><br> Equally striking were the results in suburban counties around the major cities, almost all of which usually lean toward the GOP. Big majorities opposed Issue 1 in several large suburban counties that Trump won in 2020 (including Delaware and Lorain). Even in more solidly Republican suburban counties that gave Trump more than 60 percent of their vote (Butler, Warren, and Clermont), the “yes” side on Issue 1 eked out only a very narrow win. Turnout in those big urban and suburban counties was enormous as well.<br><br> Jeff Rusnak, a long-time Ohio-based Democratic consultant, says the suburban performance may signal an important shift for the party. One reason that Ohio has trended more solidly Republican than other states in the region, particularly Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, he argues, is that women in Ohio have not moved toward Democrats in the Trump era as much as women in those other states have. But, he told me, the “no” side on Issue 1 could not have run as well as it did in the big suburban counties without significant improvement among independent and even Republican-leaning women. “In Ohio, women who were not necessarily following the Great Lakes–state trends, I think, now woke up and realized, <i>Aha, we better take action</i> ,” Rusnak said.<br><br> The Ohio results followed the pattern evident in the other states that have held elections directly affecting abortion rights since last year&#39;s Supreme Court decision. In Kansas, abortion-rights supporters carried all six of the counties that cast the most votes. In the Kentucky and Michigan votes, abortion-rights supporters carried eight of the 10 counties that cast the most votes, and in California they carried the 14 counties with the highest vote totals. Montana doesn&#39;t have as many urban centers as these other states, but its anti-abortion ballot measure was defeated with majority opposition in all three of the counties that cast the most votes. In the Wisconsin state-supreme-court race this spring, Democrat Janet Protasiewicz, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-2024-races/673567/">who centered her campaign on an unusually explicit pledge to support legal abortion</a> , carried seven of the 10 highest-voting counties. (All of these figures are from the <i>New York Times</i> ranking of counties in those states&#39; results.) For Republicans hoping to regain ground in urban and suburban communities, abortion has become “a huge challenge because they really are on the wrong side of the issue” with those voters, Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll, told me <b>.</b><br><br> The results in these abortion votes reflect <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://qz.com/13018/the-class-inversion-how-american-politics-turned-upside-down">what I&#39;ve called the “class inversion” in American politics</a> . That&#39;s the modern dynamic in which Democrats are running best in the most economically dynamic places <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/house-of-representatives-equity-research-institute-usc-analysis/673422/">in and around the largest cities</a> . Simultaneously, Republicans are relying more on economically struggling communities that generally resist and resent the cultural and demographic changes that are unfolding mostly in those larger metros.<br><br> Tom Davis, a former Republican representative from Northern Virginia who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee, has described this process to me as Republicans exchanging “the country club for the country.” In some states, trading reduced margins in large suburbs for expanded advantages in small towns and rural areas has clearly improved the GOP position. That&#39;s been true in such states as Tennessee, Kentucky, and Arkansas, as well as in Texas, Iowa, Montana, and, more tenuously, North Carolina. Ohio has fit squarely in that category as well, with GOP gains among blue-collar voters, particularly in counties along the state&#39;s eastern border, propelling its shift from the quintessential late-20th-century swing state to its current position as a Republican redoubt.<br><br> But that reconfiguration just as clearly hurt Republicans in other states, such as Colorado and Virginia earlier in this century and Arizona and Georgia more recently. Growing strength in the largest communities has even allowed Democrats to regain the edge in each of the three pivotal Rust Belt states Trump in 2016 dislodged from the “blue wall”: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin.<br><br> In 2022, Democrats swept the governorships in all three states, and won a Senate race as well in Pennsylvania. Support for legal abortion was central to all of those victories: Just over three-fifths of voters in each state said abortion should remain legal in all or most circumstances and vast majorities of them backed the Democratic candidates, according to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2022/exit-polls">the exit polls</a> conducted by Edison Research for a consortium of media outlets. The numbers were almost identical in Arizona, where just over three-fifths of voters also backed abortion rights, and commanding majorities of them supported the winning Democratic candidates for governor and US senator.<br><br> Those races made clear that protecting abortion rights was a powerful issue in 2022 for Democrats in blue-leaning or purple states where abortion mostly remains legal. But, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/14/politics/abortion-midterm-voters-politics-democrats-republicans-fault-lines/index.html">as I&#39;ve written</a> , the issue proved much less potent in the more solidly red-leaning states that banned abortion: Republican governors and legislators who passed severe abortion bans cruised to reelection in states including Texas, Georgia, and Florida. Exit polls found that in those more reliably Republican states, even a significant minority of voters who described themselves as pro-choice placed greater priority on other issues, among them crime and immigration, and supported Republican governors who signed abortion restrictions or bans.<br><br> Ohio exemplified that trend as powerfully as any state. Though the exit polls showed that nearly three-fifths of voters said abortion should remain legal in all or most circumstances, Republican Governor Mike DeWine cruised to a landslide reelection after signing the state&#39;s six-week abortion ban. Republican JD Vance, who supported a national abortion ban, nonetheless attracted the votes of about one-third of self-described voters who said they supported abortion rights in his winning Ohio Senate campaign last year, the exit polls found.<br><br> The fate of Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who&#39;s facing reelection in 2024, may turn on whether he can win a bigger share of the voters who support abortion rights there, as Democrats did last year in states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Arizona. (The same is likely true for Democratic Senator Jon Tester in Republican-leaning Montana, another state that voted down an anti-abortion ballot initiative last year.)<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/abortion-rights-issue-2024-election/674504/">Read: It&#39;s abortion, stupid</a><br><br> Brown has some reasons for optimism. After the defeat of Issue 1 last week, the follow-on ballot initiative in November to restore abortion rights in the state will keep the issue front and center. The two leading Republican candidates to oppose Brown are each staunch abortion opponents; Secretary of State Frank LaRose, the probable front-runner in the GOP race, was the chief public advocate for last week&#39;s failed initiative. Most encouraging for Brown, the “no” vote on Issue 1 in the state&#39;s biggest suburban counties far exceeded not only Biden&#39;s performance in the same places in 2020, but also Brown&#39;s own numbers in his last reelection, in 2018.<br><br> For Brown, and virtually every Democrat in a competitive statewide race next year, the road to victory runs through strong showings in such large urban and suburban counties. Given the persistence of discontent over the economy, it will be particularly crucial for Biden to generate big margins among suburban voters who support abortion rights in the very few states likely to decide control of the White House. The resounding defeat of Issue 1 this week showed again that Republicans, in their zeal to revoke the right to legal abortion, have handed Biden and other Democrats their most powerful argument to move those voters.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 13 Aug 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/abortion-gop-electoral-problem-ohio/674999/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/abortion-gop-electoral-problem-ohio/674999/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Is Trump Daring a Judge to Jail Him?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The impossible task of containing Donald Trump <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/jG_-yz6RTKPsiAqBRrlkePMgUeo=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/trump_gag_order_/original.jpg" alt="Black-and-white illustration showing Trump speaking, with a red X drawn across his mouth" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by The Atlantic. Sources: Saul Loeb / AFP / Getty.</figcaption></figure> When Donald Trump appeared last week in a Washington, DC, courtroom for his arraignment on federal election charges, the presiding judge gave the former president a few simple instructions for staying out of jail while he awaited trial.<br><br> Trump could not talk to potential witnesses about the case except through lawyers, Magistrate Judge Moxila Upadhyaya told him, and he could not commit a crime on the local, state, or federal level. Both are standard directives to defendants. But then Upadhyaya added a warning that seemed tailored a bit more specifically to the blustery politician standing before her: “I want to remind you,” the judge said, “it is a crime to intimidate a witness or retaliate against anyone for providing information about your case to the prosecution, or otherwise obstruct justice.”<br><br> When Upadhyaya asked Trump if he understood, he nodded. Fewer than 24 hours later, Trump appeared to flout that very warning—in its spirit if not its letter—by threatening his would-be foes in an all-caps post on Truth Social: “IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I&#39;M COMING AFTER YOU!” Over the following week, he attacked a potential witness in the case, former Vice President Mike Pence (“delusional”); Special Counsel Jack Smith (“deranged”); and the federal judge assigned to oversee his case, Tanya Chutkan, an appointee of former President Barack Obama (Smith&#39;s “number one draft pick,” in Trump&#39;s words).<br><br> Trump&#39;s screeds highlight a challenge that will now fall to Chutkan to confront: constraining a defendant who&#39;s both a former president and a leading candidate to take the White House—and who seems bent on making a mockery of his legal process.<br><br> “She&#39;s in a tight spot,” Barbara McQuade, a former US attorney in Michigan, says of Chutkan. Conceivably, the judge could find Trump in contempt of court and toss him in jail for violating the terms of his pretrial release. But even though in theory Trump should be treated like any other defendant, former prosecutors told me that he was exceedingly unlikely to go to prison over his pretrial statements. And Trump probably knows it. (Whether Trump will go to prison if he is convicted is another <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/08/04/trump-criminal-cases-prison-secret-service/">hotly debated</a> matter.)<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/04/donald-trump-indictment-arraignment-new-york/673617/">Read: The humiliation of Donald Trump</a><br><br> “I&#39;m sure she would be very reluctant to do that, in light of the fact that he&#39;s running for president,” McQuade told me. “So I think as a result, he has a very long leash, and I think he will simply dare her to revoke [his freedom] by saying the most outrageous things he can.”<br><br> At a pretrial hearing today, Chutkan issued her first warnings to Trump&#39;s lawyers about their client, according to reporting by Steven Portnoy of ABC News and Kyle Cheney of <em>Politico</em> . “先生。 Trump, like every American, has a First Amendment right to free speech,” she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/stevenportnoy/status/1690001911343095810">said</a> . “But that right is not absolute.” She said Trump&#39;s presidential candidacy would not factor into her decisions, and she rebuffed suggestions by a Trump lawyer, John Lauro, that the former president had a right to respond to his political opponents in the heat of a campaign. “He&#39;s a criminal defendant,” she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/kyledcheney/status/1690014529982222336">reminded</a> him. “He&#39;s going to have restrictions like every single other defendant.”<br><br> Chutkan said she would be scrutinizing Trump&#39;s words carefully, and she concluded with what she called “a general word of caution”: “Even arguably ambiguous statements from parties or their counsel,” the judge said, “can threaten the process.” She added: “I will take whatever measures are necessary to safeguard the integrity of these proceedings.”<br><br> Chutkan had called the hearing to determine whether to bar Trump and his lawyers from publicly disclosing evidence provided to them by prosecutors—a standard part of the pretrial process. The evidence includes millions of pages of documents and transcribed witness interviews from a year-long investigation, and the government argued that Trump or his lawyers could undermine the process by making them public before the trial. Despite her warnings to Trump&#39;s team, she sided with the defense&#39;s request to narrow the restrictions on what they could disclose, and she did not add other constraints on what he could say about the case.<br><br> Yet the effect of Chutkan&#39;s courtroom comments was to put Trump on notice. If he continues to flout judicial warnings, she could place a more formal gag order on him, the ex-prosecutors said. And if he ignores that directive, she would likely issue additional warnings before considering a criminal-contempt citation. A further escalation, McQuade said, would be to hold a hearing and order Trump to show cause for why he should not be held in contempt. “Maybe she gives him a warning, and she gives him another chance and another chance, but eventually, her biggest hammer” is to send him to jail.<br><br> Judges have sanctioned high-profile defendants in other cases recently. In 2019, the Trump ally Roger Stone was barred from posting on major social-media platforms after Judge Amy Berman Jackson ruled that he had violated a gag order she had issued. (Stone did honor this directive.) The Trump foe Michael Avenatti, who represented Stormy Daniels in her case against Trump and briefly considered challenging him for the presidency, was jailed shortly before his trial on extortion charges after prosecutors accused him of disregarding financial terms of his bail. “He was just scooped up and thrown into solitary,” one of his former lawyers, E. Danya Perry, told me. She said that Avenatti was thrown into the same jail cell that had held El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord. (Avenatti later <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/nyregion/michael-avenatti-trump-jail.html">claimed</a> that his treatment was payback ordered by then–Attorney General Bill Barr; the prison warden <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/22/michael-avenatti-rise-and-fall-house-arrest-profile-525301">said</a> he was placed in solitary confinement because of “serious concerns” about his safety, and Barr has called Avenatti&#39;s accusation “ridiculous.”)<br><br> Neither Stone nor Avenatti, however, is as high-profile as Trump, arguably the most famous federal defendant in American history. And Perry doubts that Chutkan would imprison him before a trial. Trump has ignored warnings from judges overseeing the various civil cases brought against him over the years and has never faced tangible consequences. “He has done it so many times and he has managed to skate so many times that he certainly is emboldened,” Perry said.<br><br> Indeed, Trump has also suggested he would ignore a gag order from Chutkan. “I will talk about it. I will. They&#39;re not taking away my First Amendment rights,” Trump <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/08/trump-on-possible-gag-order-pound-sand-00110357">told</a> a campaign rally in New Hampshire on Wednesday.<br><br> Trump&#39;s political motives for vilifying his prosecutors and once again portraying himself as the victim of a witch hunt are obvious: He&#39;s trying to rile up his Republican base. Trump also seems to be executing something of a legal strategy in his public statements about the trial. He&#39;s called Washington, DC, “a filthy and crime-ridden embarrassment,” possibly reasoning that these remarks will force the court to agree to his request to shift the trial to a venue with a friendlier population of potential jurors, such as West Virginia.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/">David A. Graham: Trump is acting like he&#39;s cornered</a><br><br> That&#39;s less likely to work, according to the former prosecutors I interviewed. “I&#39;d be shocked to see that be successful,” Noah Bookbinder, a former federal prosecutor who heads the anti-corruption advocacy group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, told me. “It&#39;s sort of like the old joke about the child who kills his mother and father and then asks for mercy because he&#39;s an orphan. I just don&#39;t see a court going for that.”<br><br> Trump&#39;s attacks also present a problem for Smith, the special counsel. On one hand, prosecutors have a clear interest in ensuring that their witnesses do not feel intimidated; on the other, Smith could feel that trying to silence Trump would play into the former president&#39;s victim narrative. Justice Department prosecutors alerted Chutkan to Trump&#39;s “I&#39;m coming after you” post in a court filing, and during today&#39;s hearing they voiced concerns that if not restricted, Trump could disclose evidence to benefit his campaign. (A Trump spokesperson said the former president&#39;s warning was “the definition of political speech,” and that it referred to “special interest groups and Super PACs” opposing his candidacy.) But Smith&#39;s team did not ask Chutkan to fully gag Trump or even admonish him. “You see the prosecutors being very, very restrained,” Bookbinder said. “With a lot of defendants who were bad-mouthing the prosecutor and witnesses, they would have immediately gone in and asked for an order for the defendant to stop doing that.”<br><br> Bookbinder described the citation of Trump&#39;s post as “a brushback pitch” by the government, a signal that they are watching the former president&#39;s public statements closely. But like Chutkan, Smith might be reluctant to push the matter very far. Fighting with Trump over a gag order could distract from where the government wants to focus the case—on Trump&#39;s alleged crimes—and it could indulge his desire to drag out the trial, Bookbinder noted. But the special counsel has to weigh those concerns against the possibility that an out-of-control defendant could jeopardize the safety of prosecutors and witnesses. “My strong suspicion is that Jack Smith doesn&#39;t want to go there,” Bookbinder said. “I think at some point he may have little choice.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 11 Aug 2023 17:38:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/trump-arraignment-charges-judge-first-amendment/674993/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/trump-arraignment-charges-judge-first-amendment/674993/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The New Old Dating Trend]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Why is matchmaking having a renaissance? <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/FZGrbkmuYbw5v6sOzF4A2DyJl5Q=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/matchmaking_final_horz/original.jpg" alt="a flying cupid shoots his arrow at an iPhone, cracking through the screen" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by The Atlantic. Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> <span class="smallcaps">Growing up in Maryland</span> , Radha Patel didn&#39;t see anyone in her area using a matchmaker. But she was aware that in India, where her parents had emigrated from, plenty of couples were fixed up—by relatives, respected elders, women in the community trusted to intuit good pairs. For some reason, the idea of it stuck in the back of her mind. It was still lingering there in 2018, when friends, frustrated with dating apps, started asking for help finding love. “I&#39;m not a tech person,” she thought. “What can I do?” Then she realized that <em>she</em> could play matchmaker.<br><br> She started setting people up, and that turned into a hobby, which later that year became a business, Single to Shaadi. She and many of the matchmakers she knows saw a wave of new clients in 2020, when the popular Netflix show <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/08/netflix-indian-matchmaking-and-the-shadow-of-caste/614863/">Indian Matchmaking</a></em> , which follows a professional cupid from Mumbai, came out. The coronavirus pandemic might have contributed to the surge; especially early on, plenty of people didn&#39;t want to go on more in-person dates than absolutely necessary. And perhaps they also realized that their time was too precious to waste by swiping fruitlessly on dating apps. According to Patel, Single to Shaadi doubled its number of active clients from 2019 to 2020, and again the next year.<br><br> The field still has momentum. New matchmaking companies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/04/tired-of-swiping-left-singles-turn-to-new-matchmaking-services-.html">have</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/style/what-its-like-to-work-with-a-matchmaker.html">launched</a> in the past few years, and the matchmakers I spoke with told me they&#39;ve had an uptick in interest recently. Some dating sites have tried to take advantage of the trend, too. In 2021, Match Group, the behemoth company that owns Tinder, Hinge, and several other dating apps, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/match-introduces-a-human-matchmaking-element-to-its-dating-app-11637269774">introduced</a> a feature on Match.com through which human coaches suggest two profiles a week for each member willing to pay $4.99 weekly. And earlier this year, a spinoff show hit Netflix: <em>Jewish Matchmaking</em> .<br><br> Something about this historical tradition appears to be meshing well with contemporary society. In a time when dating apps give users an incredible amount of control over their romantic life, for some people, letting someone else take the wheel seems more and more appealing.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In societies through time</span> and across the world, people have turned to a third party to find a partner. In Jewish communities, for thousands of years, trusted figures such as scholars and rabbis acted as <em>shadkhan</em> , or matchmakers. In Japan, a <em>nakōdo</em> (“middle person”) was traditionally enlisted to present romantic candidates. Korean families historically visited a <em>jung-me</em> to ask for a pairing, and in medieval Catholic society, the village priest sometimes played a role. In all of these customs and many others, the matchmaker typically worked for the parents of an eligible young person; the families, not just the individuals, were linked. Moira Weigel, the author of <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/labor-of-love-the-invention-of-dating-moira-weigel/9780374536954?affiliate_id=atl-347">Labor of Love: The Invention of Dating</a></em> , told me that until at least the Industrial Revolution, marriage in many cultures was commonly about agriculture: uniting families to share farm labor, and to ensure a next generation that would continue that work.<br><br> But starting around the 19th century, Weigel told me, industrialization made that kind of union less necessary for many families; love became a more common ideal. And while matchmaking has remained popular in plenty of cultures, in many others, the search for romance became a more individual pursuit. People still had some informal help; friends and family members might try, welcome or unwelcome, to set singles up. But then came dating apps—an especially solitary form of courtship.<br><br> Not only can online dating be lonely—it can be extremely time-consuming. Combing through the apps can feel like a part-time job. In 2016, Hinge <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2016/10/03/why-is-the-dating-app-hinge-bashing-swipe-apps/">reported</a> that only one in 500 swipes on the app had resulted in phone numbers being exchanged. When the company surveyed 300 of its users that same year, it discovered that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thedatingapocalypse.com/stats/">81 percent of them</a> had never found a long-term relationship on any swipe-based dating app. In 2018, when the dating company Badoo <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating-apps-millenials-10-hours-per-week-tinder-bumble-romance-love-a8174006.html">surveyed</a> 5,000 18-to-30-year-olds in the UK, it found that users spent an average of 10 hours a week on dating apps.<br><br> All of that work gives daters more agency over their love life than they had in earlier eras. They don&#39;t have to wait for a serendipitous encounter, or even leave the house. At any time, they can swipe, send messages, and ask people to meet up. But that sense of control, which for many people is a blessing, can also be a burden—especially if you&#39;re talking with several suitors at once, a common situation on apps. Patel calls it “DIY dating”: All of the analysis and overthinking involved—“ <em>What&#39;s not working? What&#39;s right?</em> … <em>Am I waiting too long in between messages? Is the dude on the other end real?</em> —you have to do it all yourself.”<br><br> No wonder, then, that matchmakers are having a moment. Many people who can afford to outsource dating labor are eager to do so. Matchmaking services can be very costly: While some companies might promise a few matches for a few hundred dollars, many charge thousands, even hundreds of thousands, for a six-to-12-month-long membership, or for a handful of guaranteed dates. But they advertise a meticulous process, in which experts methodically narrow down a large pool of candidates based on clients&#39; interests, values, and assessments of past relationships. And people don&#39;t tend to use matchmakers unless they&#39;re looking for long-term commitment, so clients can feel pretty confident that they&#39;re not wasting time on confusing situationships or misrepresented intentions.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/04/couples-dating-defining-the-relationship-status-uncertainty/673650/">Read: The scariest part of a relationship</a><br><br> A matchmaker can also act as a guide throughout the very vulnerable process of dating. It might be appealing to trade in an algorithm for an intermediary who is warm, comforting, and … human. Unlike the apps, many matchmakers give advice on what to look for in a partner, how to present oneself, when to give someone another shot, even where someone might be going wrong in relationships. I heard about this when the matchmaking company Selective Search put me in touch with their client Connie Weaver, the chief marketing officer for a life-insurance company. She told me she&#39;d been married for more than three decades before her husband died in 2020. When she started dating again, in her late 60s, she didn&#39;t know what she wanted or how to go about finding it. She was a successful executive and people person, skilled at carrying a conversation in any business meeting. “But that doesn&#39;t mean, after 35 years,” she told me, “that I was good at this.” At Selective Search, “I had someone take me by the hand and give me confidence,” she said.<br><br> Weaver&#39;s second match was someone she likely wouldn&#39;t have swiped right on, had he been on an app. She hadn&#39;t wanted to date anyone in medicine—his field. (She&#39;d had bad experiences.) But she decided to have faith in the process. “You have to trust that they&#39;re going to draw out of you <em>the real you</em> ,” she told me. Four months later, Weaver&#39;s still seeing him; it&#39;s new, but it feels special. “I can&#39;t be happier,” she told me. “Everybody says that I&#39;m glowing. And I haven&#39;t glowed for a long time.”<br><br> For people floundering in the dating world, the idea that experienced chemistry professionals could pick up on qualities hidden deep within you—and use them to lead you to someone you might have missed—could be very enticing. But in order for matchmakers to do that, they&#39;d probably need to read beyond what their clients tell them. Humans don&#39;t tend to be very good at deducing what we want for ourselves, Eli Finkel, a Northwestern University psychologist who studies romantic attraction, told me. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00466-005">some</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51251730_When_and_why_do_ideal_partner_preferences_affect_the_process_of_initiating_and_maintaining_close_relationships">studies</a> , researchers have asked participants what they look for in a partner—and found that their answers don&#39;t predict the type of people whom they really go for. And people tend to be drawn to the same qualities anyway; if you&#39;re searching for someone who&#39;s, say, attractive, nice, and funny, you&#39;re not exactly unique.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/helen-fisher-science-online-dating-apps-tinder/672419/">Read: The woman who made online dating into a “science”</a><br><br> Even if matchmakers try not to take clients at their word, Finkel thinks predicting compatibility in advance is inherently an uphill battle. “A whole lot of what makes us compatible with people is <em>emergent</em> ,” he told me. “That is, it starts to exist <em>after</em> we&#39;ve met.” Even then, chemistry is complex and mysterious, and based partly on luck. He spitballed an example: Maybe one person on a date says they&#39;re from Arkansas, and the other says, <em>Oh! I went to Arkansas on this road trip, and I went to Joseph&#39;s Mother&#39;s Deli. Have you been there?</em> How well the evening goes might depend, in part, on the answer to that question, because <em>yes</em> and <em>no</em> will spin the conversation off in different directions. Perhaps both people have been there, and they compare notes, and that leads to laughter, to an inside joke, which feels like a spark.<br><br> But love&#39;s enigma is part of matchmakers&#39; allure. If you don&#39;t have the answers yourself, you can at least hope that someone else does. Weaver told me she sees matchmaking as both “an art and a science.” On the one hand, it&#39;s comforting to think that there&#39;s a compatibility code that can be cracked. On the other, we don&#39;t want romance to be too clinical, deduced purely from a couple of interviews or a detailed questionnaire. Michal Naisteter, a Philadelphia-based matchmaker and co-host of the podcast <em>The Yentas</em> , told me that that&#39;s part of why people turn to her—and, generally, to humans rather than algorithms—for help. “Some of this process is miraculous,” she told me. “It&#39;s a little cosmic.”<br><br> This is the modern approach to romance: People want efficiency, but also humanity. They want to be independent, rather than relying on family, but they still want guidance; they want options, rather than just choosing from whatever handful of suitors are in the area, but they don&#39;t want to spend hours sifting through them. Contemporary matchmaking sits at the fulcrum of humans&#39; opposing impulses when it comes to love: It tries to balance modernity and tradition, to outsource labor, and to give people an ally in a lonely dating world, without removing their autonomy.<br><br> Patel is just one of the many matchmakers trying to show customers that they can have it all. She gave her company the tagline “Not your parents&#39; matchmaker,” and she&#39;s modernized her process: She doesn&#39;t match based on caste. She makes a point to work with people of various religions, as well as different sexual and gender orientations. Single to Shaadi doesn&#39;t work with clients&#39; parents (though Patel has another matchmaking company that&#39;s more family-oriented), and Patel tries to keep her services relatively affordable—starting at just over $100—so that younger singles can pay without involving their families. It looks a little different from the matchmaking she grew up hearing about, but it&#39;s not unrecognizable. She hasn&#39;t gotten rid of the essential perk: the gift of not needing to know exactly what you want, because you&#39;re not making decisions alone.<br><br> <em><small>When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
