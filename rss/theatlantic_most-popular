referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>华纳兄弟影业公司</figcaption></figure>我认识很多与男人结婚的令人印象深刻的女人。也许男人们也令人印象深刻。老实说，我并没有过多考虑他们。当我了解这些女性所做的一切并对世界现状表示同情时，我们很少有时间谈论她们的丈夫。有时，出于礼貌，我会问，但通常不会出现，除非正在酝酿某些冲突。这并不意味着我的朋友不爱他们的伴侣——只是，当有空间谈论他们的生活时，这就是他们想要谈论的：<i>他们的</i>生活。<br><br>看着<i>芭比娃娃</i>，我记得当我还是个女孩的时候和芭比娃娃一起玩时，肯很少出现在我的叙述中。芭比盛装打扮去上班和和朋友们出去玩；当我需要一个戏剧性的故事情节时，肯就会出现。一场婚礼！一场热血的战斗！配偶出轨！ （我能说什么？我是看着<i>《达拉斯》</i>和电视剧长大的。）<br><br>这种态度是和我一起玩的女孩们的典型态度。同样典型的是，当我们到了十几岁和二十多岁的时候，情况发生了多大的变化。随着玩偶被丢弃，游戏被重新定义为泡吧、酒吧、核对我们杰出女性宾果卡上的每件事（最终，你猜对了，婚姻），肯一家不再是客串明星。这个故事——我一生的命运——围绕着男人和他们的行为。他们在干什么？他们在想什么？他们在想我什么？关于我们？关于我们的未来？！一起？！！<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">阅读：理解芭比电影的令人惊讶的关键</a><br><br>但随着年龄的增长，我的态度又发生了转变。这并不是说我不爱男人，也不喜欢他们的想法和陪伴。我和他们约会。我将他们视为朋友和同事。但与人结合并不是我现在的主要关注点。而且，老实说，除了少数例外，我觉得她们并不像我认识的女性那样有趣。我不认为我是唯一一个这样做的人。<br><br>这是格蕾塔·葛韦格扮演的<i>芭比娃娃</i>揭露的秘密。<br><br>当谈到我们最亲密的友谊时，我认识的许多女性已经生活在芭比娃娃的世界里。正是这些女性让我们感到惊讶、惊奇、愉悦，她们把事情做好，把家庭经营得井井有条。在我们看来，他们的伴侣和丈夫是“和肯斯”——在我的朋友忙碌的生活中支持他们，推动职业进步、跨国搬家和房屋装修，同时在一个崩溃的世界中照顾年迈的父母和养育孩子。<br><br>虽然我认识的大多数女性都会和她们的女朋友一起去看<i>芭比娃娃</i>，但我的一些好朋友却是和她们的丈夫一起去看的。每个人都表示很喜欢这部电影，但不止一个人提到，在之后的几小时和几天里，丈夫们都患有严重的阴郁的 Kenergy。他们挠头担心：他们是自己家里的“肯夫妇”吗？坐在芭比驾驶的粉色双人自行车后座上？<br><br><i>芭比</i>不是一部完美或交叉的电影。它呈现了对女性复杂性的狭隘且主要是白人的看法。但它确实以极大的幽默和纯粹心碎的时刻揭示了许多女性看待和体验世界的方式。这部电影风格化且讽刺，但在粉红色的 Pepto Bismol 之下却隐藏着很多真相。而真相，尤其是女性的真相，可能会让人感到不舒服。<br><br>在女性友谊的范围内，芭比<i>就是</i>一切。但在这个空间之外，女性常常被视为一无是处。葛韦格当然知道这一点。正如亚美莉卡·费雷拉 (America Ferrera) 饰演的格洛丽亚 (Gloria) 在她充满激情的独白中所说，在现实世界中不可能成为一名女性。这个世界是由男人创造的，也是为了男人而创造的，他们不必考虑芭比需要多少劳动力来维持梦想之家的运转。<br><br>这是许多女性群聊和 Instagram 分享中的一个熟悉的主题，但我不确定它是否得到了好莱坞通常为有关超级英雄、枪支或男人炸毁事物的电影保留的大预算流行文化饱和待遇。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-ken/674852/">阅读：芭比就是一切。肯就是其他一切。</a><br><br>也许没有什么比男人可能并不总是女人思想和世界的中心这一事实更令人不安的了。<br><br>这或许可以解释为什么关于这部电影的大量讨论和媒体——完全是关于女性、由女性制作的——已经转向以男性为中心。具体来说，肯.我们现在已经阅读了有关<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/ryan-gosling-ken-barbie-movie">瑞恩·高斯林</a>（精彩）表演的文章、肯对<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://screenrant.com/barbie-2-new-ken-actors-fancasting/">续集</a>。<br><br>当然，这些都是关于一部有趣的电影的有趣的事情。但她们的数量之多让我想知道：我们是否对在女性的叙述中徘徊感到如此不舒服，以至于我们——甚至我们当中的女性——不得不急于谈论男性？难道我们就这么害怕伤害男人的感情吗？<br><br>看<i>《芭比娃娃》</i>时我笑了很多，但也哭了很多——作为一个女孩是多么艰难，作为一个女人是多么艰难，世界还要多长时间才能拍出另一部关于我们生活的大制作电影和想法。我什至有点迷茫地想到现在作为一个男人是多么的困惑和挑战。<br><br>但如果有续集，请不要以肯为主角。<br><br></div>

World]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>两年前妻子去世后，理查德·E·格兰特开始拍摄自己谈论丧亲之痛的视频，创造了失去亲人后的非凡生活记录。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8ny6MtCE5Eq8BE0Kxg8D-bkQGhM=/0x0:3307x4134/648x810/media/img/2023/07/31/eyevine03346058/original.jpg" alt="演员理查德·E·格兰特闭着眼睛的肖像" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>索菲亚·斯普林 / Guardian / eyevine / Redux</figcaption></figure>在镜头前，演员理查德·E·格兰特倾向于散发出一种不为人知的、阴暗的气质：无论他的角色表达了多少，你总是能感觉到字里行间有一些无法校准的东西。在他的新回忆录<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/a-pocketful-of-happiness-a-memoir-richard-e-grant/9781668030691?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《一袋幸福》</em></a>中，格兰特优雅地将自己的职业生涯概括为数十年的“极简主义恶行”。他的角色包罗万象，从享乐主义的浪荡演员（《 <em>Withnail and I</em> 》）到专制的女子乐队经理（ <em>《Spice World》</em> ），再到迷人的犯罪同伙（他在<em>《你能原谅我吗？</em> 》中获得奥斯卡提名的角色），但如果他们有共同的共同点属性，那就是如果他们偷了你的钱包，你甚至不会感到惊讶。<br><br>然而在生活中，格兰特将诚实变成了一种富有创造力、极其精致的艺术形式。大约两年前，与他结婚 35 年的妻子、方言教练琼·华盛顿 (Joan Washington) 因肺癌去世，在失去她的几个月后，他在 Instagram 上记录了丧亲之痛的片段。在典型的视频中，他的脸稍微偏离中心，视线远离镜头。他看上去衣衫不整。他看起来很闹鬼。 “令人难以理解的是，我们再也不能互相接触或交谈了，”他在一卷中说道。在另一张照片中，他拍摄了自己走过树林的情景，简单地说：“一次一步。”<br><br>在悲痛之中——这是最孤立的状态——格兰特迅速建立了社区。 “在您与我们分享的这些深思熟虑的视频中，我找到了令人难以置信的安慰；他们美丽的诚实，他们的痛苦，但总是在美好生活的更大马赛克中仔细地重新构建每一件作品，”最近当格兰特分享他母亲去世的消息时，一位女士评论道。总的来说，这些上传的内容可能会让人迷失方向，这也是它们作为失去亲人后的生活记录如此具有启发性的原因。格兰特发布了来自朋友家的视频；他推广自己的项目；他重新创作了<em>《Withnail》</em>中的场景来打发隔离期间的 10 天时间。但一切的根本原因是琼的缺席——正如他在澳大利亚海滩上散步时在一篇帖子中所说的那样，这种感觉“就像一只没有壳的老乌龟”。<br><br>今年春天早些时候，当我在格兰特位于伦敦西南部的家中会见他时，他似乎仍然对过去几年的悲伤、生产力和公众反应的融合感到茫然。在他的文学经纪人和女儿的敦促下，他写了一本关于琼生命最后几个月的回忆录，其中穿插了他职业生涯过去几年的故事。由此产生的书<em>《一袋幸福》</em>本月在美国出版，以琼去世前给他的遗嘱命名，保证如果他能试着找到一点点来感激每一个幸福，他就会没事。单日。 “在我们的婚姻中，她以前从来没有想到过这句话，”66 岁的格兰特说道，他身材修长，穿着黑色灯芯绒裤子和黑色衬衫，腿上抱着女儿的猫。 “我想，如果我们中有人说过这句话，我们就会得出结论，这听起来像是霍尔马克卡片上的内容。但事实证明，这是一个非常深刻的生活准则。”<br><br>他决定将最迷人的高潮（奥斯卡奖、与奥利维亚·科尔曼在贝蒂·戴维斯以前拥有的房子里唱卡拉 OK）和最惨淡的低谷（琼的诊断、有一天格兰特无意中使用<em>“终端”</em>一词时她的愤怒）共同构成这本书的叙述他说，这是出于他想要准确捕捉大多数人的生活的愿望。 1986 年，也就是格兰特与琼结婚的那一年，格兰特充其量只是一名打工演员，负责拼凑地区戏剧片尾字幕和电视电影。在经历了九个月的痛苦失业之后，丹尼尔·戴·刘易斯拒绝了他的一个角色：布鲁斯·罗宾逊的半自传故事片中华丽、浑身湿透的威斯奈尔。这份工作是一个巨大的突破。第一周排练结束时，怀孕27周的琼就早产了。他们的第一个孩子蒂芙尼只活了半个小时，她的肺部尚未发育成熟，无法自行呼吸。 “我不认为你能克服它，”格兰特说。 “你可以绕过它。”<br><br> <em>《一袋幸福》</em>捕捉到了如何在灾难性消息发生时完全摆脱困境，即使是在持续的承诺和繁杂的日常任务中。格兰特写道，在等待琼的放射治疗开始时整理花园，收拾起琼的衣服盒子以腾出空间，并为她可能再也不会穿它们而感到震惊。他们的关系是这本书引人入胜的中心支柱——一位极其注重隐私的苏格兰方言教练和一位来自南部非洲斯威士兰、比她小十岁、长期过度兴奋、心直口快的演员之间一段不可预测的持久爱情。在他们关系之初，琼的事业已经很成熟，而格兰特则在做服务员。在他们的婚姻过程中，地位的平衡发生了变化，但他对我说，他们从未失去联系：“一段从 1983 年 1 月在床上谈话开始的关系，以床上握着彼此的手而结束。” 38 年后与她交谈。”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/05/emma-straub-interview-this-time-tomorrow-grief/674035/">阅读：现代生活的决定性情感</a><br><br>在这本书去年首次出版的欧洲和澳大利亚，格兰特带着这本书进行了巡回演出，举办了一场戏剧表演，其中融入了琼的视频和照片；在第二幕中，观众有机会分享自己的悲伤。他愿意表现出一种通常被认为是私人的经历——如此积极地颠覆我们的感觉，即“正确”的方式来度过它是坚忍的、孤独的——是惊人的。他对在丧亲之痛后立即给予人们空间的不言而喻的传统不屑一顾，而这正是“你需要人们倾诉的时刻”。对于那些根本不承认琼死讯的人，他的态度明显很凶猛。今年早些时候，他发布了一段视频，内容是在法国偶遇一对夫妇，他们是他认识 25 年的朋友，但他们在街上明显避开了他，而不是对没有联系表示遗憾。 “我感觉自己好像被打了一巴掌，”他告诉我，气得浑身发抖。<br><br>在 Instagram 上，正如他的许多评论者所明确指出的那样，他的言论产生了强烈的认可感。他愿意公开哀悼，这引发了一些问题：如果分享悲伤可以让人感觉宣泄，为什么要隐藏悲伤呢？为什么悲伤的配偶、父母、孩子应该安静地表达呢？为什么我们对那些正在经历巨大损失的人的本能反应是躲起来并躲起来？ “我认为（人们）担心他们要么会入侵，要么你会像人行道上的果冻一样崩溃，”格兰特说。他承认，他仍然有被悲伤“折磨”的日子，唯一能做的就是屈服并等待它过去，但他也有美好的日子，灿烂的日子，充满幸福的日子。 。他在导演埃默拉尔德·芬内尔（《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/12/emerald-fennell-promising-young-woman-subverting-femininity/617467/"><em>前途无量的年轻女子</em></a>》）备受期待的第二部长片<em>《索尔特伯恩》</em>中扮演角色。他还计划出演萨姆·门德斯和阿曼多·伊安努奇关于超级英雄系列的新 HBO 讽刺剧，以及与保罗·路德和珍娜·奥尔特加合作的 A24 的<em>《独角兽之死》</em> 。 （后者是今年夏天在演员罢工期间获准拍摄的少数独立项目之一。）<br><br>他认为，他现在所做的很多事情——巡回售书、现场活动——放在过去都太令人生畏了。 “琼之死的重新调整让我意识到，你所担心的所有这些事情都与自我有关，”他说。 “处理死亡是如此灾难性的，以至于它简化了其他一切。”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

2026 年民主党在国会取得压倒性胜利，甚至足以撼动特朗普领导的共和党。<br><br>特朗普可能会想象他手头上有一场一劳永逸的战斗：猛烈打击，快速打击，然后安安静静地享受不法权力的腐败特权。如果是这样，他和他的追随者就是在自欺欺人。整个任期都被围绕特朗普利用总统权力保护自己免受涉嫌犯罪后果的斗争所消耗。<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-476_c185.pdf"><i>303 Creative LLC 诉 Elenis</i></a>案涉及大多数美国人高度重视的法律的两个不同方面：第一修正案保护国家不得强迫言论，特别是与个人的政治或宗教信仰或良知相悖的言论，以及公民权利防止企业基于种族或性别、性别、性取向或其他受保护特征歧视潜在客户的保护措施。当言论自由和非歧视保护陷入紧张时会发生什么？<br><br> A law at issue, the Colorado Anti-Discrimination Act, prohibits a public accommodation from denying “the full and equal enjoyment” of goods or services to any customer based on disability, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, marital status, national origin, or ancestry.<br><br> Lorie Smith runs a small business that sells graphic design, website design, and marketing. She wanted to start creating bespoke wedding websites that include her original art and prose celebrating the marriages of clients. In keeping with her religious tradition, which teaches that marriage is the union of one man and one woman, she does not believe that same-sex weddings in fact result in marriages. Smith feared that if she began creating wedding websites at all, the Colorado Civil Rights Commission would compel her to offer her services to couples planning same-sex weddings.<br><br> She was generally willing to serve gay, lesbian, bisexual, and trans customers as clients for projects unrelated to weddings, and was generally unwilling to do creative work for anyone of any sexual orientation if the work violated her beliefs––for example, by encouraging violence, demeaning someone, or promoting atheism.<br><br> Like most Americans, I don&#39;t much like Smith&#39;s beliefs about same-sex marriage. But is her refusal to perform creative work that affirms gay unions as marriage functionally the same or legally distinct from discriminating <i>on the basis of sexual orientation</i> ? And under the Constitution, if Smith began designing wedding websites, could the state compel her to create such a website, featuring her original artwork and prose, celebrating a same-sex marriage?<br><br> Under a cartoonishly maximalist approach to First Amendment concerns and an imprudently minimalist approach to public-accommodation concerns, the law could treat the act of selling any good or service as an expressive activity. A gas-station owner could decline to sell fuel to a lesbian couple; an innkeeper could refuse to rent them a room; a bartender could refuse to shake their cocktails. Under a cartoonishly maximalist approach to nondiscrimination law, the state could coerce and compel most any creative professional (an artist, a speechwriter, a journalist) to create things they abhor. To cite Judge Timothy Tymkovich&#39;s dissent in the district-court ruling, an unwilling Muslim movie director could be compelled to make a film with a Zionist message; an atheist muralist could be made to accept a commission celebrating evangelical zeal.<br><br> To avoid such extremes, it helps to distinguish among cases.<br><br> For example: Is the good or service being offered truly expressive, like supplying an event with a comedian emcee or a keynote speech, or nonexpressive, like supplying an event with electricity or folding chairs? Will refusal to provide a service impose a heavy burden on the would-be customer, like the only gas station in town refusing to sell fuel to a gay couple? Or will the burden be tiny or nonexistent, as would be the case if one trans-owned craft store didn&#39;t want to sell candles to a Catholic parish in a city with an IKEA, a Costco, and Amazon Prime delivery?<br><br> What&#39;s unusual about <i>303 Creative LLC v. Elenis</i> is that both sides in the case agreed on a lot of such distinctions. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-476_c185.pdf">majority opinion</a> , by Justice Neil Gorsuch, summarizes those undisputed matters: Smith will “gladly create” graphics and websites for clients of any sexual orientation. She will not create content that “contradicts biblical truth” for clients of any sexual orientation. Her belief that marriage is the union of one man and one woman is “a sincerely held religious conviction.” The websites Smith plans “will be expressive in nature,” and will express her beliefs while celebrating her view of what marriage is under her own name, with attribution. And if Smith refuses a customer, numerous other companies “offer custom website design services.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/lgbtq-first-amendment-supreme-court/672321/">David French: The most consequential First Amendment case this term</a><br><br> Because Colorado stipulated all of that, it was, in effect, taking a relatively maximalist position: Smith must make websites for gay marriages, if she makes wedding websites at all, even if the work <i>is</i> original creative expression that sets forth her views and values under her own name; even if her representations <i>are</i> earnest, such that she is generally willing to make websites for gay clients and generally unwilling to make websites at odds with her faith in ways that have nothing to do with gay people; and even if gay couples will have no trouble finding other custom-website designers.<br><br> Gorsuch– (who also wrote the majority opinion in the 2020 case that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/06/15/863498848/supreme-court-delivers-major-victory-to-lgbtq-employees">found</a> that “the 1964 Civil Rights Act protects gay, lesbian, and transgender employees from discrimination”) wrote in his majority opinion that under Colorado&#39;s logic, “the government may compel anyone who speaks for pay on a given topic to accept all commissions on that same topic—no matter the underlying message—if the topic somehow implicates a customer&#39;s statutorily protected trait. Taken seriously, that principle would allow the government to force all manner of artists, speechwriters, and others whose services involve speech to speak what they do not believe on pain of penalty.”<br><br> Gorsuch also takes care to clarify that “we do not question the vital role public accommodations laws play in realizing the civil rights of all Americans,” noting the Court&#39;s ongoing recognition of “a &#39;compelling interest&#39; in eliminating discrimination in places of public accommodation,” and specifying that state governments can protect the access of gay people specifically to “innumerable goods and services that no one could argue implicate the First Amendment.”<br><br> Although the ruling is clear that many public-accommodations laws pass constitutional muster while some “sweep too broadly when deployed to compel speech,” how to decide edge cases is less clear. “Determining what qualifies as expressive activity protected by the First Amendment can sometimes raise difficult questions,” Gorsuch writes. “But this case presents no complication of that kind.” If some future ruling allows a refusal to do business with gay people because of their sexual orientation itself, or starts treating every restaurant owner, innkeeper, plumber, mechanic, and dentist as a creative professional, I&#39;ll worry intensely about the consequences for gay people trying to navigate society equally. But this ruling does not go there.<br><br> As for its practical consequences: Are same-sex couples going to have trouble finding vendors for creative wedding work? Thankfully, no. Seventy-one percent of Americans support gay marriage, as do 89 percent of 18-to-29-year-olds. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor frets that a graphic designer refusing to make websites for same-sex weddings will stigmatize gay people; I think wedding-industry folks who refuse to work on same-sex weddings are more likely to create a stigma around their own business. And how many engaged gay couples even want to hire a creative professional who strongly opposes gay marriage to collaborate with them on their wedding?<br><br> Looking back on this case in 20 years, I suspect we&#39;ll conclude that the Court struck a reasonable, practical balancing of rights that continued to afford substantial protections against discrimination in public accommodations––and that its compelled-speech precedent will be invoked again and again by Americans, including gay people and progressives, to vindicate their rights against state actors being coercive in ways that we haven&#39;t even yet anticipated.<br><br> <b>The Student-Debt Cases</b><br><br> In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22-506.html"><i>Biden v. Nebraska</i></a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22-535.html"><i>Department of Education v. Brown</i></a> , the Court considered the Biden administration&#39;s attempt to cancel student-loan debt. Was the president lawfully empowered to do such a thing, or was he usurping power that properly belongs to Congress? In a 6–3 decision, the Court ruled that the Biden administration&#39;s secretary of education “asserts that the HEROES Act grants him the authority to cancel $430 billion of student loan principal. It does not.”<br><br> Reacting to the decision, Democratic Senator <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1674794719048781825">Chuck Schumer</a> declared, “This disappointing and cruel student debt ruling shows the callousness of the MAGA Republican-controlled Supreme Court.” Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren complained that the Court “refuses to follow the plain language of the law on student loan cancellation,” as if student-loan-debt cancellation was not just lawful but obviously so, such that any contrary finding was bad-faith obstinacy. Love or hate the ruling, those critiques are egregiously misleading.<br><br> That Biden exceeded the lawful authority of the executive branch is not a view original or exclusive to MAGA Republicans. In 2021, the Office of the General Counsel at the Department of Education was asked to weigh in on whether the secretary of education had statutory authority to cancel, discharge, or forgive student loans. “We believe the Secretary does not have the statutory authority,” the resulting memorandum stated in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://static.politico.com/d6/ce/3edf6a3946afa98eb13c210afd7d/ogcmemohealoans.pdf">a detailed legal analysis</a> .<br><br> On July 28, 2021, Representative Nancy Pelosi was asked about different approaches to canceling student-loan debt. “People think that the president of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.ph/xCDHb">she said</a> . “He does not. He can postpone. He can delay. But he does not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress … The president can only postpone, delay, but not forgive.”<br><br> Charlie Rose, the top lawyer in President Barack Obama&#39;s Education Department from 2009 to 2011, wrote a legal memo dated May 7, 2021, analyzing the Biden administration&#39;s plan for his law firm, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mass-student-debt-cancellation-legally-risky-says-top-obama-education-lawyer-11651689489">according to <i>The Wall Street Journal</i></a> . “If the issue is litigated,” the memo stated, “the more persuasive analyses tend to support the conclusion that the Executive Branch likely does not have the unilateral authority to engage in mass student debt cancellation.”<br><br> Elizabeth Goitein is an expert on presidential powers who was counsel to progressive then-Senator Russ Feingold and a senior director at the Brennan Center for Justice. She addressed the student-loan controversy in a 2022 <i>Washington Post</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/01/biden-student-debt-emergency-powers-are-slippery-slope/">op-ed</a> . “Biden cannot use emergency powers to forgive certain private student loan debts or debts incurred after the covid-19 emergency declaration lapses,” she wrote. “Sidelining Congress through emergency powers means sidelining the checks and balances that safeguard our liberties and democracy.”<br><br> One needn&#39;t even agree with the general counsel at the Department of Education, or the point of view that Pelosi expressed in 2021, or Rose, or Goitein, to see the egregious dishonesty of characterizations like those made by Warren: It is simply false that any reasonable person who reads the plain text of the law sides with Biden. And Congress is free to cancel student-loan debt anytime. The only obstacle to its doing so is the inability of those who favor cancellation to pass such a law, because of insufficient support for it among America&#39;s elected representatives. That is not on the Supreme Court.<br><br> <b>Unanimous and Near-Unanimous Decisions</b><br><br> The most interesting and comprehensible of the unanimous decisions is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/600/22-174/#tab-opinion-4758923"><i>Groff v. DeJoy</i></a> . This case concerns Gerald Groff, an evangelical Christian who took a job with the United States Postal Service back when that didn&#39;t involve having to work on the Christian sabbath. But times changed: USPS made a deal with Amazon to make deliveries on Sundays.<br><br> To continue observing the sabbath as directed in the Ten Commandments, Groff transferred to escape Amazon&#39;s delivery footprint, ultimately winding up in tiny Holtwood, Pennsylvania, but Amazon, resting for neither man nor God, expanded there too. Groff then started getting written up for refusing to labor on Sundays. So he sued under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In his telling, USPS could accommodate his religious belief “without undue hardship.” For a unanimous Court, Justice Samuel Alito wrote that “undue hardship” is shown “when a burden is substantial in the overall context of an employer&#39;s business,” not when there is any trifling cost (a standard that some lower courts were erroneously adopting due to language in a bygone case). Employers “must show that the burden of granting an accommodation would result in substantial increased costs in relation to the conduct of its particular business,” the Court ruled.<br><br> For better or worse, it sided with a worker against the interests of a large employer. It is likely to marginally benefit religious workers of all faiths while marginally burdening corporations and other businesses. How does this square with characterizations of the Court as “right-wing”?<br><br> Less important for our purposes than the details of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/22-148.html"><i>Jack Daniel&#39;s Properties v.

Google LLC</i></a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/search.aspx?filename=/docket/docketfiles/html/public/21-1496.html"><i>Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh</i></a> , which concern the responsibilities of social-media companies subject to laws that regulate content, is the fact that all nine justices were able to reach consensus.<br><br> The Court also handed down a 7–2 decision about what constitutes a true threat under the First Amendment; Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Clarence Thomas dissented. Another 7–2 case, <i>Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts Inc. v. Goldsmith</i> , concerns the professional photographer Lynn Goldsmith, who took a photo in 1981 of the up-and-coming musician Prince. She later granted <i>Vanity Fair</i> a one-time-only license to use the Prince photo as an “artist reference for an illustration”––which turned out to mean that <i>Vanity Fair</i> hired the famous pop artist Andy Warhol to do an illustration of Prince. Warhol created a bunch of different images based on the photo. Among his creations was a silk-screen portrait, <i>Orange Prince</i> , that <i>Vanity Fair</i> ’s parent company reused for a 2016 cover. Was that an infringement of the photographer&#39;s copyright or fair use?<br><br> Siding with the photographer, Sotomayor wrote the majority opinion, joined by Thomas, Alito, Gorsuch, and Barrett, as well as Ketanji Brown Jackson and Brett Kavanagh. Dissenting together were Roberts and Elena Kagan. I have no idea who got that one right, but the shifting coalitions of justices undermine the reductionist narrative of partisans siding with their team.<br><br> <b>The Stakes</b><br><br> Inaccurate characterizations of major institutions are always worth correcting, but the stakes are especially high when the Supreme Court is attacked inaccurately by those seeking to undermine it.<br><br> Insofar as the Court loses its standing and legitimacy, it loses its ability to check and balance future abuses of power by other branches of government and <i>all</i> of its precedents lose their standing.<br><br> The right finds it easier to see the value of a legitimate Supreme Court now that it is sometimes winning. Progressives smarting from last term&#39;s abortion decision might think, on first instinct, that it would be good if the Court lost its influence. But that is shortsighted. Because of <i>Dobbs</i> , the question of abortion has been returned to the political branches of government. If the high court lost its power in American life, proponents of abortion rights would be no better off––the matter would still turn on elected officials at the federal and state levels.<br><br> Whereas if the Court lost its legitimacy––if the people and the political branches ceased to respect its rulings––Americans would lose rights and protections as varied as the constraints on law enforcement in <i>Miranda</i> , the press protections in <i>New York Times Co. v. Sullivan</i> , and the marriage-rights protections in <i>Obergefell</i> . Absent a strong Supreme Court, I tremble to think how the most retrograde Deep South legislators would draw redistricting maps and constrain voting rights.<br><br> So what would I suggest for Democrats and progressives who dislike the current Court majority and wish to reverse its rulings? Harken back to the days of the Warren Court, regarded by many as an especially left-leaning era, and the days of the Rehnquist Court and beyond, when conservatives thought they&#39;d succeeded in electing presidents who appointed a majority they liked, only to see abortion and affirmative action upheld. In those days, when conservatives were losing ground, or failing to win it back despite decades of effort, what would you have seen as legitimate criticism and what would you have regarded as corrosive attacks on the legitimacy of the judiciary? Let that––and truth––be your guides. Meanwhile, practice tolerance, forbearance, and persuasion, and win elections. Another era of the Court always comes.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/defense-supreme-court/674874/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/defense-supreme-court/674874/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[20 Books to Get Lost in This Summer]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> <em>The Atlantic</em> ’s writers and editors recommend titles to match some warm-weather moods. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Es2NLqBWWY2eZk2w9HUdIbP9EV0=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/05/promofinal/original.jpg" alt="The Summer Reading Guide, with a black-and-white photo of two people reading at the beach" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Martin Parr / Magnum</figcaption></figure> Summer is when lovers of books feel freest to read without restraint—while lying on a beach, swinging on a porch, or perching on a stoop at the end of a sweaty day. <em>The Atlantic</em> ’s writers and editors want to help in this endeavor, and so we&#39;ve selected books to match some warm-weather moods.

Lara, the book&#39;s narrator, lives contentedly on her cherry farm in North Michigan with her kind husband and three doting daughters, all merrily trapped together during the pandemic. To kill time while they pick cherries in the orchard, Lara tells them the story of her great, youthful, summer-long love affair with a rakish man, Peter Duke, who would go on to become a very famous actor (the character put me in mind of Ethan Hawke or Robert Downey Jr.). The daughters hang on her every word. The story itself has the sweetness and tartness of cherries, taking place mostly at a summer-stock-theater company called Tom&#39;s Lake where Lara and Peter meet and fall in love as she herself decides whether or not to continue her almost-accidental career as an actress. But this nostalgia trip contains no regrets. As Lara emphasizes in one of many similar refrains, the life she went on to live is all she has “ever wanted in the world.” <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/gal-beckerman/">Gal Beckerman</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/daughter-of-the-dragon-anna-may-wong-s-rendezvous-with-american-history-yunte-huang/9781631495809?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Daughter</em></a> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/daughter-of-the-dragon-anna-may-wong-s-rendezvous-with-american-history-yunte-huang/9781631495809?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>of the Dragon: Anna May Wong&#39;s Rendezvous With American History</em></a><br><br> by Yunte Huang<br><br> <em>Daughter of the Dragon</em> is a vivid and heartbreaking biography of the 20th-century Hollywood actress Anna May Wong, and Huang&#39;s third book about a Chinese American icon&#39;s “rendezvous with American history.” Wong grew up movie-obsessed in a Chinese immigrant family in Los Angeles. When she began to act professionally in the 1920s, she struggled to land leading roles: Anti-miscegenation laws meant that she couldn&#39;t kiss a white man on-screen, and she was passed over for top jobs in favor of white actors in yellowface. Though Wong eventually became a bona fide celebrity, she was frequently forced into stereotypical parts—the tragic “Madame Butterfly,” the conniving “Dragon Lady.” (When blamed for perpetuating racist tropes, she responded that “when a person is trying to get established in a profession, he can&#39;t choose parts. He has to take what is offered.”) Wong occupies a singular place in both Hollywood history and the history of Asian Americans in the 20th century; as Huang puts it, her existence was determined by “simultaneous repulsion and desire.” Through detailing her resilience in the face of these challenges, Huang tells an essential story about the tenuous place of Asians in America. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/maya-chung/">Maya Chung</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/family-lore-elizabeth-acevedo/9780063207264?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Family Lore</em></a><br><br> by Elizabeth Acevedo<br><br> Many of the most pivotal scenes across Acevedo&#39;s poetry and fiction take place near, or in, a kitchen. In <em>Family Lore</em> , her first novel for adults, the question of whether to serve pork takes on the weight of sacrament as a group of Dominican women reluctantly plans the menu for a still-living sister&#39;s upcoming wake. Flor, one of four sisters, can predict the exact day of someone&#39;s death. At the outset of the book, she announces that she&#39;ll be holding a living wake for herself, and the decision rattles her sprawling family. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/05/elizabeth-acevedo-future-young-adult-fiction/589318/">Much of Acevedo&#39;s work</a> revolves around the primal emotions family can evoke—need, disappointment, belonging, connection. Her latest offering is her most impressive emotional excavation yet, a decade-spanning epic that sees Acevedo deftly stretching out into the new space afforded by a shift in audience. Vividly rendered and deliciously complex, <em>Family Lore</em> will stick with you long after you leave Flor&#39;s table. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/hannah-giorgis/">Hannah Giorgis</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/learned-by-heart-emma-donoghue/9780316564434?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Learned by Heart</em></a><br><br> by Emma Donoghue<br><br> At a 19th-century York boarding school for young ladies, Eliza Raine, the daughter of an English father and an Indian mother, studies French, geography, and how to be a wife. Since leaving Madras for Britain, she&#39;s felt she has something to prove; her parents weren&#39;t legally married, and her social standing has suffered as a result. In class, she is focused, working hard to memorize and recite lessons. But her new roommate, Anne Lister, doesn&#39;t have to try at all—she&#39;s effortlessly brilliant. And that&#39;s not the only reason she stands out. <em>Learned by Heart</em> is the culmination of Donoghue&#39;s long obsession with Lister, the real-life 19th-century figure whose exhaustive, coded diaries, which describe her many affairs with other women, inspired the television show <em>Gentleman Jack</em> . Lister, as she makes classmates call her, is an oddity—she walks with a masculine swagger and is constantly breaking rules—and Eliza is fascinated. In close quarters, the two build a tentative romance. Donoghue&#39;s affection for the savvy, strange Lister is obvious, and the author makes her teenage couple&#39;s partnership both deeply serious and wonderfully naive. But the reader knows from the first page that their infatuation won&#39;t last, and the novel is ultimately a tender, sad account of first love. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/emma-sarappo/">Emma Sarappo</a></em><br><br> <span class="section-headline-top">Transport Yourself</span> <span class="section-headline-bottom"><em>to Another Place</em></span><br><br> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0060928557/?tag=theatl0c-20"><em>Heat Wave</em></a><br><br> by Penelope Lively<br><br> The pleasure of <em>Heat Wave</em> is its slow, mesmerizing drama. Set in the English countryside over a hot summer, Lively&#39;s slender novel introduces us to Pauline, a divorced editor in her 50s who has opted for an existence “rich in carefully nurtured minor satisfactions.” Among those satisfactions is the freedom she feels in her summer cottage, unleashed from London, her partner, and her office job. Staying next door—and buzzing at a different frequency—are her daughter, Theresa; her son-in-law, Maurice, a smarmy, up-and-coming writer; and their toddler. With a gimlet eye, Pauline observes Theresa&#39;s unhappiness and Maurice&#39;s shifty egotism, the amalgam of repression and delusion that seems to hold their relationship together; as she fixates on them, she thinks back on her own marriage. Lively&#39;s wry prose captures the mundane clarity of Pauline&#39;s life among the wheat fields and the way that a maternal ache, when left to its own devices, can crescendo. Never has a mother-in-law&#39;s judgment seemed so deliciously understated—and so devastating in its conclusion. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/jane-yong-kim/">Jane Yong Kim</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/toy-fights-a-boyhood-don-paterson/9781324093626?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Toy Fights</em></a><br><br> by Don Paterson<br><br> The Scottish poet Don Paterson is kind of a genius. His poems are ferocious, his critical writings are chatty or witheringly technical or both, and he&#39;s also produced—who does this?—several collections of aphorisms. (“Anyone whose students &#39;teach him as much as he teaches them&#39; should lose half his salary.”) And now a memoir, <em>Toy Fights</em> : It covers God, guitar, origami, breakdown, and Dundee, Scotland, the poet&#39;s hometown, “dementedly hospitable in the way poor towns are,” he writes. It was a place where, once upon a New Romantic time, you could encounter beautiful Billy Mackenzie of operatic popsters The Associates: “He had the attractive power of a 3-tesla MRI scanner, and if there was as much as a paperclip of susceptibility about your person, forget it: you&#39;d find yourself sliding across the room as if you were on castors.” The prose is fizzing-brained, it&#39;s hyperbolic, and it has a hyperbolic effect: It makes you want to delete everything you&#39;ve ever written and start again, this time telling the truth. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/james-parker/">James Parker</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/love-in-color-mythical-tales-from-around-the-world-retold-bolu-babalola/9780063078505?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Love in Color</em></a><br><br> by Bolu Babalola<br><br> Babalola&#39;s story collection updates and retells romantic myths and fables from a bevy of cultures, tossing a reader into the richly imagined world of characters from Egypt or Nigeria, then sending them to her version of Greece or China. (She also has some fun with history: Here, Queen Nefertiti runs a club-slash-criminal-underworld-headquarters, where she punishes abusive husbands and protects vulnerable women.) The characters and scenarios can feel a tad archetypical, though that is understandable given her source material. But the stories are just <em>fun</em> , and none of them is long enough to drag. Many of them end with a new couple on the precipice of a great adventure. And in each encounter, love is neither an uncontrollable fever that sneaks up on a person, nor an inevitable force that shoves a couple together. It&#39;s a kind of shelter where artifice can be abandoned—the result of careful attention that does away with illusions and misconceptions. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/emma-sarappo/">ES</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/friday-black-nana-kwame-adjei-brenyah/9781328911247?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Friday Black</em></a><br><br> by Nana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah<br><br> My first exposure to Adjei-Brenyah&#39;s work was in a crowded, airless classroom where he read aloud a passage from the title story of his collection, <em>Friday Black</em> : “It&#39;s my fourth Black Friday. On my first, a man from Connecticut bit a hole in my tricep. His slobber hot.” In the scene, the employees of a big-box retailer face down a horde of (literally) rabid shoppers lured by deals that are (again, literally) to die for. Each story in this brutally absurd, original book, Adjei-Brenyah&#39;s debut, similarly whisks the reader somewhere unexpected: an amusement park where customers can legally fulfill violent racist fantasies against Black actors; a courtroom where a George Zimmerman analogue explains why he was justified in murdering children with a chain saw. But these summaries don&#39;t capture the alchemy that Adjei-Brenyah performs. <em>Friday Black</em> presents a warped reflection of our own reality that feels both horrifying and clarifying. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/lenika-cruz/">Lenika Cruz</a></em><br><br> <span class="section-headline-top">Take a Deep</span> <span class="section-headline-bottom"><em>Dive</em></span><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-kennedy-imprisonment-a-meditation-on-power-garry-wills/9780618134434?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Kennedy Imprisonment: A Meditation on Power</em></a><br><br> by Garry Wills<br><br> Come join the cult of Garry Wills, the greatest of all American political journalists.

It&#39;s a riveting critique of the first family of 20th-century liberalism, a work that, among other things, scrutinizes the sexual and drinking habits of the Kennedys. Not fixating on Wills&#39;s baser insights is hard. (For example: Jack&#39;s womanizing was born of competition with his father&#39;s philandering. Or: The Kennedys acted more like English aristocrats than Irish immigrants.)

Oh, and your guide on the journey is an Italian semiotician with a roving intellect and a keen eye for the absurd. That&#39;s <em>Travels in Hyperreality</em> . Eco&#39;s travelogue collects 26 dispatches, mostly written in the 1970s during the author&#39;s visits to the US In the essays, the theorist and novelist plays a classic role: the foreigner who is alternately amused and appalled by American maximalism. (A famously kitschy roadside inn, in Eco&#39;s rendering, resembles “a nuptial catacomb for Liza Minnelli”; Disneyland is “an allegory of the consumer society” whose “visitors must agree to behave like its robots.”) But Eco&#39;s postcards from the past are also infused with insight—and a sense of prophecy. They explore, in technicolor detail, what Eco calls our “faith in fakes.” Travel the country long enough, his trip suggests, and it becomes difficult to tell where the landscape ends and the dreamscape begins. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/megan-garber/">Megan Garber</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0316390615/?tag=theatl0c-20"><em>The Last Whalers</em></a><br><br> by Doug Bock Clark<br><br> Like an anthropologist determined to get lost in the world of his subject, Clark, a journalist, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/02/what-doug-bock-clark-learned-last-whalers/582643/">went to live on a remote Indonesian island</a> in the Savu Sea a decade ago so that he could get as close as possible to the Lamalerans, a tribe of 1,500 people who are some of the last hunter-gatherers on Earth.

Clark goes out to sea with them on their hunting boats, becomes emotionally involved in their conflicts, and sees firsthand the way modernity, in the form of cellphones and soap operas, encroaches on their isolated community.

Bombarded ruins were everywhere. Cities like Frankfurt that managed to quickly remove them would flourish. Others lived with the mess and stagnated. Women did most of the cleanup, as part of bucket brigades, because of a postwar imbalance in the population—many men never returned home from the front. For every 1,000 German men in 1950, there were 1,362 women. This is the off-kilter society dissected in Jähner&#39;s highly readable cultural history. What makes his book so fascinating—and so poignant—is the relative banality of his subject: a country of one-night stands and wild dance parties, with little recognition of the atrocities it had committed. In fact, Germany largely wallowed in self-pity. Rendered with irony and based on skillful scholarship, Jähner&#39;s book describes both a democratic rebirth and a moral evasion, uncomfortably and inextricably linked.  — <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/franklin-foer/"><em>FF</em></a><br><br> <span class="section-headline-top">Feel Wonder</span> <span class="section-headline-bottom"><em>About the Universe</em></span><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/francisco-alison-mills-newman/9780811232395?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Francisco</em></a><br><br> by Alison Mills Newman<br><br> Mills Newman originally published <em>Francisco</em> , based on her life and love affair with her eventual husband, the director Francisco Newman, in 1974; the publisher New Directions rereleased it earlier this year. It&#39;s told by a young Black actor in California, and the eponymous character is her lover, who is obsessively working on a documentary. The narrator is dissatisfied with Hollywood and her career, but she&#39;s hungry for everything else life offers. She is a wise and insightful reader of people, and she and Francisco hang out with a lot of them, up and down the coast of California. Mills Newman&#39;s novel feels like a long party, punctuated by difficult questions: about white standards of beauty, what it really means to be a revolutionary, how to be an artist, and how to be a woman partnered with a man. In the decades since it was published, Mills Newman has become a devout Christian and come to reject elements of the novel. These include, as she mentions in a new afterword, the “profanity, lifestyle of fornication, that i no longer endorse”—adding another layer of complexity to this curious, short book. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/maya-chung/">MC</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1999368436/?tag=theatl0c-20"><em>Elena Knows</em></a><br><br> by Claudia Piñeiro, translated by Frances Riddle<br><br> <em>Elena Knows</em> is a mystery novel, but it&#39;s certainly not a traditional page-turner.

Her book reimagines the real Gunness, a late-19th-century Norwegian immigrant and early American female serial killer, as a woman overcome by yearning. Belle can&#39;t shut her eyes to the dazzling, splendid world; in Searls&#39;s translation, the thoughts running through Belle&#39;s head are breathless. “All this longing, this dripping love-sweat, it stuck to everything she did,” the narration frantically recounts. From the first pages she craves a blissful obliteration that can be found only through intimacy. After she moves from Norway to the American Midwest, her desire curdles into something more delusional that threatens everyone in her orbit—especially her lovers. Kielland gives readers scarce glimpses of lucidity as the novel takes on the tone of a dream. Belle has “the northern light tangled around her ribs”; she feels “the wet grass grow in her mouth.” Empathy slowly turns to horror, though, as it becomes clear that nothing can fill up the canyon inside her except an ultimate, bloody climax. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/emma-sarappo/">ES</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399573003/?tag=theatl0c-20"><em>The Afterlives</em></a><br><br> by Thomas Pierce<br><br> <em>The Afterlives</em> is set in the near future, in a town full of holograms; the plot involves a haunted staircase, a “reunion machine” meant to reunite the living and the dead, and a physicist who argues that everything in existence is roughly 7 percent unreal. And yet, the protagonist—a 33-year-old loan officer named Jim—is a thoroughly normal guy. Even as the book&#39;s events spin off in strange, supernatural directions, its real focus is on Jim and his developing relationship with Annie, a high-school girlfriend who&#39;s recently been widowed; when they&#39;re offered the chance to try the reunion machine, the story is less concerned with the details of that futuristic technology than it is with Annie&#39;s grief and Jim&#39;s quiet, persistent love for her. No matter how surreal things become, Pierce implies, people will keep moving forward in much the same way, living humdrum little lives together, wondering and hoping in the face of existential mystery.

The most notable of them belongs to Septimus Smith, a young World War I veteran who hallucinates, hears voices, and speaks of suicide—and yet who is, like Clarissa, a celebrant of life in all its abundance: For him, death offers the only way to preserve his vision of plenitude.

Weissnix is a 21-year-old Jewish refugee from Vienna who can barely speak English when the book begins, unsure if she has been orphaned by the war. The story of their affair is also a story about Ilsa&#39;s American education: She learns from Bayoux how to function at the margins, how to succeed by charming, how never to lose a sense of one&#39;s own distance from the center. The more she grows into her independence, though, the further he sinks, until it&#39;s clear that he can&#39;t be saved even as she begins to build a life of her own. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/gal-beckerman/">GB</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-stone-face-william-gardner-smith/9781681375168?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Stone Face</em></a><br><br> by William Gardner Smith<br><br> Following the path of James Baldwin, Richard Wright, and Chester Himes, a Black American émigré arrives in 1950s Paris to find an existential freedom in the city&#39;s cafés and bars, a space free of white leering and judgment. Simeon Brown, an aspiring painter and the protagonist of Smith&#39;s deeply underappreciated novel, grew up in Philadelphia, where he suffered a brutal racist attack that left him blind in one eye, an incident that haunts him. While abroad, his reprieve from racial animus dissolves when he befriends a group of young Arabs struggling against France&#39;s colonial atrocities in Algeria.

But Simeon&#39;s Black expat friends believe taking up the Arab cause risks the very freedom they all came searching for. Trapped by a dizzying moral question, Simeon is forced to confront the shifting realities of identity and racial allegiance as he fights the personal demons that have followed him across the ocean. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/oliver-munday/">Oliver Munday</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/hotel-du-lac-anita-brookner/9780679759324?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Hotel du Lac</em></a><br><br> by Anita Brookner<br><br> <em>Hotel du Lac</em> is <em>technically</em> a vacation novel. On the page, though, it&#39;s much cooler and more dispassionate than that description implies. When Edith Hope, a 39-year-old romance writer, arrives at a Swiss hotel as fall begins for a period of self-imposed exile, the landscape is gray, the gardens are damp, and everything in her bedroom is “the color of overcooked veal.” Edith has committed a sin that Brookner withholds until midway through.

Edith can&#39;t quite bond with any of them—she&#39;s too brittle and skeptical for sisterhood—but each woman shades a different kind of existence that throws Edith&#39;s final decision into sharper relief. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/sophie-gilbert/">Sophie Gilbert</a></em><br><br> <span class="section-headline-top">Devour Something</span> <span class="section-headline-bottom"><em>Totally New</em></span><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-guest-emma-cline/9780812998627?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Guest</em></a><br><br> by Emma Cline<br><br> Alex, the protagonist of Cline&#39;s second novel, is an escort in her early 20s, desperate to evade paying both her New York City back rent and a menacing ex-boyfriend to whom she owes an apparently hefty sum of money.

The discomfiting yet universal phenomena of aging, being ill, and having your body let you down are Irby&#39;s most reliable subjects, and anaphylaxis, perimenopause, and diarrhea all get their moments in <em>Quietly Hostile</em> , her fourth essay collection. But the book is also a receptacle for her wildest dreams, such as what she would say to Dave Matthews if she could meet him backstage, or a self-indulgent meditation on how she would rewrite original <em>Sex and the City</em> episodes (fueled by her time as a writer on its reboot, <em>And Just Like That</em> ). When she wants to, Irby can evoke grief without blinking: She recounts, for example, her final, painful, conversation with her mother. But her writing about the great transition from being “young and lubricated” to middle-aged is reliably moving in its own way, and consistently hilarious. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/emma-sarappo/">ES</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-wager-a-tale-of-shipwreck-mutiny-and-murder-david-grann/9780385534260?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Wager</em></a><br><br> by David Grann<br><br> The dramatic story of the 18th-century shipwreck of the HMS Wager seems almost ready-made for Grann, the best-selling <em>New Yorker</em> writer famous for dynamic narrative histories, such as his previous book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/killers-of-the-flower-moon-the-osage-murders-and-the-birth-of-the-fbi-david-grann/9780307742483?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em></a> . When the British ship gets shredded traversing the treacherous waves and rocks of Cape Horn on a quixotic mission to search for and plunder enemy Spanish boats, the survivors find themselves stranded on an island off the coast of Patagonia. What happens next can be neatly summed up by the fact that Grann has used a quotation from <em>Lord of the Flies</em> as part of his epigraph. His dogged search through ships&#39; logs and other contemporaneous accounts of the disaster and its mutinous aftermath has turned up the kind of sterling details that make his writing sing; he is also interested in the way these events were recorded and then recounted, with many different people trying to shape the memory of what happened. Grann simultaneously reconstructs history while telling a tale that is as propulsive and adventure-filled as any potboiler. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/gal-beckerman/">GB</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-late-americans-brandon-taylor/9780593332337?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Late Americans</em></a><br><br> by Brandon Taylor<br><br> A small, quiet act “had the indifference of love,” Taylor writes near the end of a chapter in <em>The Late Americans</em> . In this scene, a couple is on the outs; they each seem to feed off of needling the other. Yet even as the relationship fissures, Timo makes sure Fyodor gets home safe, driving behind him as Fyodor walks, unsteadily drunk, through the Iowa City night and back to his cold, blank apartment. Their distant togetherness echoes across the novel, where young poets, pianists, meatpackers, and aspiring investment bankers are clumped on and around a university campus, teetering through graduate courses, financial strain, hapless affairs, and the casual dread of not quite knowing their place in the world. The connections between Taylor&#39;s multiple protagonists seem alternately random, doomed, and deeply romantic—much like the conditions that tie them to their creativity, and that keep them moving elliptically, tenderly, toward coming of age. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/nicole-acheampong/">Nicole Acheampong</a></em><br><br> Photography Credits from top to bottom: Guy Le Querrec/Magnum; Herb List / Magnum; JK / Magnum Photos; Herb List / Magnum; Clinton Cargill; Donovan Smallwood for <em>The Atlantic</em><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/summer-reading-2023/673948/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/summer-reading-2023/673948/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump’s Inevitability Problem]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> His apparent stranglehold on the GOP race is both emboldening and hindering. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/pItqRQjM6NijNJzJjGhB2qfety4=/0x312:6000x3687/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_1577576024-1/original.jpg" alt="7 月 28 日，唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 在 2023 年林肯晚宴上向宾客致意。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Scott Olson / Getty</figcaption></figure><small><i>这是</i>《大西洋<i>日报》的一个版本，是一份时事通讯，可引导您了解当天最大的故事，帮助您发现新想法，并推荐最好的文化。</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a></small><br><br> There&#39;s Donald Trump, and there&#39;s everyone else. At the moment, the former president of the United States appears unbeatable in the 2024 Republican primary race. But perhaps <i>inevitable</i> is a trickier word than it seems.<br><br> First, here are three new stories from <i>The Atlantic</i> :<br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/ukraine-kakhovka-dam-destruction-gallery/674806/">Ukraine after the deluge</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/">The misunderstood reason millions of Americans stopped going to church</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/summer-covid-wave-2023/674863/">One more COVID summer?</a></li> <strong>It&#39;s Iowa Time</strong><br><br> What happens when you say the unsayable? Former Representative (and current GOP presidential contender) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/will-hurd-2024-book/629398/">Will Hurd</a> found out the hard way Friday night. “Donald Trump is not running for president to make America great again,” Hurd told the Republican masses inside the Iowa Events Center. “Donald Trump is running to stay out of prison.”<br><br> The boos rained down, and, rest assured, they were mighty.<br><br> Hurd was one of 13 candidates who had trekked to Des Moines for the Iowa GOP&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/07/28/iowa-gop-lincoln-dinner-draws-2024-contenders-to-des-moines-friday/70457582007/">cattle-call event</a> known as the Lincoln Dinner. Prospective voters and donors gathered roughly six months ahead of Iowa&#39;s first-in-the-nation caucus to remind themselves of their importance, which may or may not be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/12/iowa-caucus-democrats-dnc-vote-2024-presidential-primary-election/672444/">waning</a> . The night was ostensibly a chance for Iowans to listen to a range of electability pitches. Former Vice President Mike Pence told the room he would reinstate a ban on transgender personnel in the US military and endorsed the idea of a national abortion restriction after 15 weeks. The businessman Vivek Ramaswamy rattled off a list of government agencies he would shut down: the FBI, CDC, DOE, ATF, and IRS. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis boasted that he had refused to let his state “descend into a Faucian dystopia” during the pandemic and called for term limits in Congress. (One dinner attendee, the 89-year-old Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley—currently serving his eighth term—probably didn&#39;t like that one.)<br><br> The whole spectacle—including the after-parties where you could snap selfies with candidates or, at the DeSantis event, knock down a pyramid of Bud Light cans—felt like a study in performative competition.<br><br> Each speaker was given a democratizing 10-minute time limit to deliver his or her remarks (poor Asa Hutchinson suffered the embarrassment of having his mic cut off), but all were merely warm-up acts for the headliner. When Trump finally took the stage, he seemed tired, bored, and annoyed with this obligation. A lack of teleprompters meant that Trump spent the bulk of his 10 minutes looking down at printed notes, only occasionally making eye contact with the audience or ad-libbing. He got a few chuckles out of his old pandemic go-to, the “China virus.” He notably referred to his White House predecessor as “Barack Hussein Obama.” The only newish development was that Ron “DeSanctimonious” had been shortened to the easier-to-say but far more confusing “DeSanctis.”<br><br> Trump is not running as an incumbent, but it sure seems that way. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/us/politics/2024-poll-nyt-siena-trump-republicans.html"><i>New York Times</i> /Siena College poll out today</a> shows Trump with a 37-point lead over DeSantis, who was the only other candidate able to crack double digits among respondents. Did January 6 matter? Do the indictments matter? Does <i>anything</i> remotely negative about Trump matter?还没有。 Trump remains the Katie Ledecky of the 2024 contest—so far ahead of the pack that it feels wrong to even call it a race. Trump knows it too. He may not even bother to show up at the first Republican debate next month, in Milwaukee.<br><br> These factors would suggest that the Republican Party is delaying the inevitable, that the GOP base earnestly wants to “Make America great again” … again. And yet, the various campaign buses keep on rolling across Iowa and New Hampshire. The noble attempts at retail politics and down-home charm continue apace. Pence strategically name-dropped the Iowa chain Pizza Ranch. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina tweeted a video of himself fist-pumping after <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/votetimscott/status/1685070929343229952">sinking a bag in cornhole</a> . (“If God made you a man, you play sports against men,” Scott said onstage Friday night.) Expect <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/06/the-secret-presidential-campaign-dress-code/674298/">much more of this</a> at the Iowa State Fair, which kicks off in just over a week.<br><br> I was in the press pen at the Lincoln Dinner on Friday night, and I spent the weekend in Iowa speaking with various Republicans about all things 2024. I came away with the sense that a not-insignificant portion of conservatives is willing to accept Trump&#39;s dominance, but that many are still quietly hoping for a deus ex machina to avoid a 2020 rematch. The still-rolling indictments don&#39;t seem to have much effect—too many Republican voters argue that the legal cases against Trump are politically motivated. He shows no signs of giving up his nickname, “Teflon Don.”<br><br> The fact that Trump is running from a stance of inevitability is paradoxically both emboldening and hindering. Trump doesn&#39;t seem to want to actually be president (as Hurd suggested). Maybe he just wants to prove he can win again. Will that motivational gap matter to voters? Will <i>anything</i> matter?<br><br> <b>Related</b> :<br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/will-hurd-2024-book/629398/">The revenge of the normal Republicans</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/06/the-secret-presidential-campaign-dress-code/674298/">The secret presidential-campaign dress code</a></li> <strong>Today&#39;s News</strong><br><br><li> A state judge in Georgia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/us/trump-georgia-prosecutor-election.html">rejected</a> Trump&#39;s bid to derail the investigation into his attempts to overturn election results in the state.</li><li> A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-missile-strike-hits-kryvyi-rih-ukraine-interior-ministry-2023-07-31/">Russian missile strike</a> on Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#39;s hometown, killed at least six people, including a 10-year-old girl and her mother, and wounded dozens more.</li><li> The Islamic State <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-suicide-bombing-death-toll-rises-45-2023-07-31/">claimed responsibility</a> for Sunday&#39;s suicide bombing of a political rally in Pakistan that killed at least 54 people.</li> <strong>Dispatches</strong><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/the-wonder-reader/"><b>The Wonder Reader</b></a> <b>:</b> In 1980, the film critic Roger Ebert argued that movies were better in theaters.

Having one parent with myopia doubles the odds that a kid will need glasses. Having two parents with myopia quintuples them. Over the years, she did indeed diagnose lots of nearsighted kids with nearsighted parents. These parents, she told me, would sigh in recognition: <i>Oh no, not them too.</i> But something was changing.</p> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/10/kids-glasses-vision-increased-nearsightedness-myopia/671244/">阅读全文。</a><br><br> <b>More From <em>The Atlantic</em></b><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/fitboxing-classes-sparring-noncontact/674869/">What “fitboxing” is missing</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/speaking-ukrainian-russian-language/674860/">“Ukrainian is my native language, but I had to learn it.”</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/twitter-alternatives-bluesky-mastodon-threads/674859/">The weird, fragmented world of social media after Twitter</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/ups-strike-union-contract-package-deliveries/674864/">America is drowning in packages.</a></li> <b>Culture Break</b><br><br> <b>Read.</b> “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/poem-michael-white-i-wish-i-could-remember/674867/">I Wish I Could Remember</a> ,” a new poem by Michael White.<br><br> “ <i>It&#39;s just a dream</i> , / I&#39;d tell myself.

So does the internet. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/t7BDtYVKp8MpaERxjMGJdYeYExo=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/twitter_final/original.jpg" alt="蓝色鸟舍的照片插图，上面画有黑色“X”" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic. Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> I woke up Sunday to find I had begun using the social network formerly known as Twitter. The app had updated to show the new name chosen by its owner: X. Now, underneath the friendly and familiar blue icon with a white bird, that letter alone was displayed— <em>X</em> —as if my iPhone was affirming that Elon Musk&#39;s Twitter had become an error. Soon after, the bird icon disappeared, too, in favor of a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90927535/elon-musk-twitter-logo">white-on-black 𝕏</a> .<br><br> The change has rolled out slowly. First the website rebranded, and then, by the end of last week, Musk had dismantled the Twitter signage on the company&#39;s San Francisco headquarters and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/twitter-san-francisco-building-x-elon-musk-4e0ae2a3b1b838b744bb2dc494f5b23c">erected a huge, glowing <em>X</em></a> on its rooftop. (It has since been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abc7news.com/twitter-x-sign-taken-down-bright-light-sf/13578182/">taken down</a> .) Reprising the creeper thinking that inspired Musk to name Tesla&#39;s models the “S,” “3,” “X,” and “Y,” such that they would combine to spell “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://electrek.co/2016/07/30/tesla-vehicle-naming-convention-sexy-model-y-elon-musk/">S3XY</a> ,” Twitter also reportedly gave several conference rooms new, <em>X</em> -oriented names, including “eXposure” and, once again, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/technology/twitter-x-elon-musk.html">s3Xy</a> .”<br><br> As my colleague Charlie Warzel <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-musk-x-rebrand/674818/">explained last week</a> , Musk has been trying to make X happen for decades now; PayPal arose from a merger with his X.com website. Now he&#39;d like for X to be a superapp, a platform for chat, banking, news, shopping—everything. Musk&#39;s insistence on packaging that idea, already megalomaniacal, with a logo that resembles a nerdy middle-school boy&#39;s notebook doodle underscores a difficult truth: Nerdy middle-school boyhood, once a phase to be outgrown, has become a philosophy of life. “Anyone else look at the 𝕏 icon and not even want to open this app?” the Chicago-based product designer Chad Ashley tweeted—err, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/cgpov/status/1685616291703410688">posted on X</a> . He&#39;s right. It&#39;s embarrassing.<br><br> Maybe that&#39;s for the best. As a cultural practice, social media is bad— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/fix-facebook-making-it-more-like-google/620456/">people aren&#39;t meant to talk to one another this much</a> —and anything that might erode the practice is worthwhile. But also, Twitter, like other social platforms and the very internet itself, is already redolent of the seventh grader&#39;s mindset that Musk&#39;s behavior betrays. Maybe we should be grateful that his X fetish forces us to admit that truth, so we can someday move beyond it.<br><br> In its un-rebranded form, Twitter helped make the lifestyle of posting seem benign. Before it was a company (and then an online addiction), <em>twitter</em> was just a word: a reference to the sound of birds or certain kinds of human prattle. What harm could come of that?<br><br> Lots. For starters, it normalized the very notion of a platform where everyone can speak to everyone, all at once. This feels natural today, but it wasn&#39;t when the service launched in 2006. Back then, some might have had a blog, but people ordinarily posted only to small, closed online networks. That&#39;s how Facebook still worked, and LinkedIn too, and Orkut, may it rest in peace. Social networks were initially designed around communities of trust. Twitter and then Instagram are to blame for expanding the act of posting to the world.<br><br> The shift from social networks to social media was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/">culturally destructive</a> . It set the expectation that everyone deserves—is owed, even—an audience for their every notion, quip, photo, or activity. This is a selfish child&#39;s idea of living in the world, now so commonplace that opposing it seems controversial.<br><br> That ethos has consequences. The rise of public shaming online, whether <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0">in response to jokes</a> , to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/the-evolution-of-shaming/470544/">affirm personal virtue</a> , or to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/best-shaming-happens-private/612082/">deepen group membership</a> , was dependent on an infrastructure of public data from which shameworthiness could be assessed, and also on the viral spread that Twitter both invented and perfected. So was the spread of QAnon, and the planning for the January 6 insurgency. The ability to repost something instantly and without comment to one&#39;s own network, first invented as the “retweet button” in 2009, became a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/how-the-retweet-ruined-the-internet">vector for harassment and misinformation</a> , allowing messages true or false, virtuous or vicious, to reach far beyond their original environments. Every other platform adopted a version of this feature because of its ability to produce engagement, and now imagining social media without it is almost impossible.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/">Read: The age of social media is ending</a><br><br> Those are influences of function—many frequently acknowledged. Less discussed: Twitter and the services it influenced also changed aesthetic life. They brought a new style to the fore: juvenile narcissism. X is its purest, dumbest distillation, a seemingly edgy but ultimately corny name that evokes mathematics and nightclubs, pornography and tabletop games.<br><br> Like many styles, Musk&#39;s (and Twitter&#39;s) came out of a subculture, and one that thrives online. The infinity of social media creates communities at the fringe. In the best cases, these improve the lives of people who might otherwise struggle for connection, but they can also serve as bubbles that amplify and normalize perversion. When everyone can find a group of like-minded individuals, all flavors of mindedness can end up seeming justified—including, most of all, the weird-schoolboy-mindedness of the people who happen to have invented the internet as we know it.<br><br> Online culture began in corners where weirdos could connect. Dialed into local <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/">BBSes</a> , or logged on to Usenet threads and text-based virtual worlds called MUDs, nerds and outcasts were the first to find their tribes online. Some shared recipes or crochet patterns; others expressed their board-game, anime, or furry fandoms; while still others passed around conspiracy theories. And there were always piles and piles of naked pictures.<br><br> Across many of these communities, no matter their host, content, or members, an ethos of dorky behavior was ascendant—and it persists today. You can&#39;t browse a subreddit for plumbing or coffee-brewing tips without running the risk of wading through a hundred nested replies containing dumb jokes, sneers, and sexual innuendo. Bizarre beliefs that once would have been confined to email forwards became widespread on Facebook. Every tweet becomes an opportunity for some miscreant, mansplainer, or literalist to pick your words apart. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Comic_Book_Guy">Comic Book Guys</a> took over.<br><br> Sexual desire and frustration, familiar feelings for the outcast teenage nerd, pervade the social internet. S3xy-ness is everywhere. Posts by women are dismayingly likely to produce advances, or threats, from creepers on all platforms; at the same time, sex appeal is a pillar for the influencer economy, or else a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/style/onlyfans-porn-stars.html">viable</a> and even noble way to win financial independence. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-internet-is-for-porn">The internet is for porn</a> , as the song goes.<br><br> In all these ways, online life today descends from where it started, as a safe harbor for the computer nerds who made it. They were socially awkward, concerned with machines instead of people, and devoted to the fantasy of converting their impotence into power. When that conversion was achieved, and the nerds took over the world, they adopted the bravado of the jocks they once despised.

</style>On a hot summer day in Ukraine, two young boys named Timur and Slavik were playing on what used to be the banks of the Kakhovka Reservoir, part of the Dnieper River. I met them when I was visiting the area in July. The air&#39;s tranquility was occasionally pierced by the sounds of fighting in a frontline town not far away. This region is a focal point of the Ukrainian counteroffensive, and in June, evidence suggested that Russians, trying to slow down their enemy&#39;s advance, blew up the Kakhovka Dam.<br><br> I wanted to witness the devastation firsthand. It soon became clear that the collapse would reshape the landscape for decades to come. Everything south of the dam was swallowed by the murky waters of the river.<br><br> Downstream, in the city of Kherson, the flooding forced thousands of people and animals to evacuate, many of them under Russian fire. Northeast of the dam, the reservoir has turned into a barren, muddy plain stretching to the horizon. The task of rebuilding from this environmental disaster is now added to the challenges facing Ukraine when hostilities with the Russians cease.<br><br> Built in the 1950s, the Kakhovka Reservoir was close to the size of Utah&#39;s Great Salt Lake and supplied water to all of southern Ukraine and the Crimean Peninsula. Water from the dam irrigated farms and orchards, and the electricity generated by the dam&#39;s hydropower plant was used in villages throughout the region. The Zaporizhzhia nuclear-power plant also used reservoir water to cool its reactors. Now all of that is gone. In its place lies an uncertain future for the farming and fishing industries.<br><br> One day, I started a conversation with an old man who was washing his car behind a fence. His home was not far from where the shoreline of the reservoir used to be. Bob Dylan was playing from a tiny speaker. The man, who said his name was Ihor, invited me up on his roof to survey the scene. “There is no such view of our new desert from any rooftop around,” he told me. We sat together on the top of his dacha as the sun began to set on what I could see was now a surreal lunar landscape. <br><br><img alt="A couple embrace on a rocky beach" height="663" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lx5hGxAxHP7IRs-F9TLiVsLmK4w=/928x663/media/img/posts/2023/07/JN05_The_Atlantic_230628_Kakhovka_Dam_Final_Edit/original.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lx5hGxAxHP7IRs-F9TLiVsLmK4w=/928x663/media/img/posts/2023/07/JN05_The_Atlantic_230628_Kakhovka_Dam_Final_Edit/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OdAkLUpdeMtZ3l0cm6oTPXfUVB0=/1856x1326/media/img/posts/2023/07/JN05_The_Atlantic_230628_Kakhovka_Dam_Final_Edit/original.jpg 2x" width="928" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption class="caption"> A couple embrace where the water once flowed on the Dnieper River, in Zaporizhzhia. </figcaption><img alt="TK" height="412" src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/nm-C-5E-mbgj_Z5ZiotD6GeDpkY=/928x412/media/img/posts/2023/07/Untitled_2a/original.jpg" srcset="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/nm-C-5E-mbgj_Z5ZiotD6GeDpkY=/928x412/media/img/posts/2023/07/Untitled_2a/original.jpg, https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/nqqIdNPziCkvvZ57v5lC4e0eifs=/1856x824/media/img/posts/2023/07/Untitled_2a/original.jpg 2x" width="928" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption class="caption"> In the village of Marianske, a bridge has been blown up at the edge of the reservoir.

He had been married for more than 20 years to his ex-wife, and they have a kid together. I have heard about many of his former girlfriends before his first marriage, and I know he had one girlfriend after his marriage ended and prior to dating me.<br><br> He also has a best friend, a man who lives next door to us. A few weeks after our wedding, I was looking for a place in the filing cabinet to stash some papers I&#39;d brought from my prior home, and I saw a paper stuck in the roller wheel. It said “[name of his best friend] loves [my husband&#39;s name].” I wanted to find out what this was about, so I invaded his privacy. I found many cards and love notes from this friend to my husband dated about 12 years prior to our wedding.<br><br> I cried and was in shock. I spoke with my husband, and he said that after his divorce from his wife of two decades, he was hurt. He didn&#39;t want a woman but wanted a companion. I found out that he spoke with several men during that time frame—about four years—until he fought to overcome his feelings. He made his best friend move out of his house, but the friend still lives next door to us, on my husband&#39;s family&#39;s property. I have to be reminded every day of what went on between them. They had sex when they were together, and now when I look at the two of them, that&#39;s all I can envision.<br><br> I know it was about 10 years before I came into the picture, but I&#39;m bitter. My husband says he has no romantic feelings for his friend at all anymore. My husband is an only child, and he says this best friend is like a brother.<br><br> This all bothers me so much. It&#39;s been over a year since I found out, and I still can&#39;t seem to accept my husband. What can I do to get over this? My husband is loving and kind to everyone. He is good to me and my daughter and loves family, both his and mine. But I keep seeing his past mistake. He says it&#39;s his past, and happened before I came along. Still, being reminded daily is hard.<br><br> <strong>Anonymous</strong><br><br> <strong>Dear Anonymous,</strong><br><br> One of the most jarring experiences in a relationship is learning that something is not as it seemed. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/02/how-to-tell-child-sperm-donor/673194/">discovery of a secret</a> can leave you reevaluating everything you thought you knew about your partner, and make you question both your sense of reality and the trust you thought you shared.<br><br> For you, there&#39;s the added layer that two secrets were revealed at once. First, that your husband&#39;s closest friend is also his ex. Second, that your husband has had relationships with men. And although both facts have left you feeling confused and betrayed, it will be important for you to consider your reaction to each of these discoveries separately in order to figure out how to move forward and heal from these deceptions.<br><br> On the first point, your husband had a romantic relationship with the person you knew only as his best friend, and you&#39;re reeling from a lie of omission. Putting gender aside for a moment (because we&#39;ll discuss that next), you weren&#39;t told that someone very close to him and present in both of your lives as your next-door neighbor has a sexual history with your husband. This isn&#39;t a “Whoops, I forgot to mention it” oversight, but a deliberate attempt to prevent you from finding out. I say that gender isn&#39;t the issue here because even if this person were a woman, I imagine you would feel betrayed had you not been told that his closest friend who also lives on your shared property is also his ex.<br><br> It makes sense that you feel bitter after your trust has been breached. And although you had a conversation about what you discovered and your husband came clean about his history, more has to be done to repair the damage from his dishonesty. For instance, has he shared with you why he didn&#39;t tell you about his romantic involvement with his best friend, and what steps he will take to be honest in the future? Has he taken full responsibility for keeping this from you, regardless of his reason? (There&#39;s a difference between “Yes, I lied, but it was because of X” and “I lied because of X, but regardless, I never should have lied, and I&#39;m committed to being honest with you in the future.”) Have you shared with him how untethered his holding of this secret makes you feel as you begin your marriage together, and what your expectations are, going forward, regarding honesty?<br><br> When you have conversations like this, you&#39;ll need to listen from a place of curiosity and compassion, which doesn&#39;t mean that you aren&#39;t holding him accountable for deceiving you. Instead, you&#39;re creating an environment that can incubate more trust between you. He might, for example, say that he was afraid to tell you because he believed you would feel threatened by the daily presence of an ex and want him to end a friendship that&#39;s very important to him, and he felt stuck between disclosure and losing his best friend. He might say he was worried that if you knew he was attracted to men, you might reject him or even leave him (and given your reaction, he could have been right). In turn, you might tell him that his hiding relevant information about an ex with whom he interacts regularly has left you wondering what else he might be hiding, and questioning whether you can trust him: Has he shared the full extent of their past and current relationship? Are there other secrets unrelated to this person that he&#39;s still hiding?<br><br> As you talk, make sure you&#39;re being completely honest not just with him, but also with yourself. You will need to reflect on what will make you feel safe in the years ahead and communicate that to him. This might include a full accounting of his relationship with his best friend so that more aspects of the story don&#39;t come out later, his sharing any outstanding lies of omission with you now so there are no more surprises (you might frame this as “If there&#39;s anything that I will want to know, now is the time to tell me, because telling me later will likely make it impossible for me to trust you again or stay with you”), and going to couples therapy to work through this together. These are just suggestions—you will have to decide what you truly need, and ask for that.<br><br> You might also discuss your feelings about the current living arrangements. What might not have been a problem had there been no secret to begin with could be a problem now, because your trust has been fractured. Perhaps you&#39;re comfortable with their continuing friendship but would prefer that the ex not live next door, or maybe you&#39;re fine with this proximity given how long ago they were romantically involved. Something to think about as you answer this question is what you mean when you say that “being reminded daily” of your husband&#39;s ex is hard. Which reminder is hard for you: that he had a romantic past with an ex who&#39;s in your lives, that he deceived you about it, or that the ex is a man?<br><br> This brings me to the second secret—your husband&#39;s attraction to men—which seems more complicated for both of you. Neither you nor your husband appears comfortable with his sexuality. You say “he fought to overcome his feelings” after dating the ex and talking with several men over a four-year period, which indicates shame or denial on his part, and your disapproval and judgment come across in your calling his dating a man “his past mistake”—something you don&#39;t say about any of his former girlfriends. You each seem reluctant to acknowledge that your husband has been attracted to both men and women, and you&#39;ll need to examine what your husband&#39;s sexuality brings up for both of you so that these feelings don&#39;t contribute to more secrecy.<br><br> You might start by exploring why you “can&#39;t seem to accept” him and clarifying any misconceptions or assumptions you have about bisexuality. Maybe you believe that it means he will always miss being with men and therefore might cheat on you—which is not how sexual attraction works. Just as you will always be attracted to other people, so will he; the key is that neither of you will act on those desires if you both choose to be in a monogamous relationship. You can ask him to share with you what his experience is as someone attracted to both men and women so that he can clarify what his sexuality means for him. You can talk about your respective histories with cultural or family stigma regarding same-sex partnerships, and how those views might evolve so that there&#39;s space for your husband to be loved fully by you as his authentic self—a man who seems to be attracted to both men and women, and who is in a monogamous marriage. If you force his authentic self into hiding, you will be encouraging more secrecy and causing your husband to feel shame for who he is. You might need to spend some time trying to understand (perhaps with the help of a therapist) how it is that the man you love and are attracted to becomes someone else in your mind—someone you view with aversion—because he has a history with partners of his own gender.<br><br> Sometimes we don&#39;t talk about the very thing we need to discuss most, because once a truth is acknowledged, we can&#39;t un-acknowledge it. Right now you&#39;re both acting as if your husband isn&#39;t attracted to men, and wasn&#39;t even when he was having sex with one (instead, you write that he wanted “a companion” while reeling from a divorce). If you want a marriage based on honesty, avoiding the truth won&#39;t be helpful.<br><br> Here&#39;s that truth: Your husband&#39;s romantic past is part of who he is, just as yours is part of who you are. We all want to bring our full self into a marriage, and to be loved and accepted for who we really are. Now that the secrets are out, instead of denying what they mean about the person you married, embrace the truth together, in all of its complexity and discomfort, so that you can build this new marriage with the trust and openness you desire.<br><br> <em>Dear Therapist is for informational purposes only, does not constitute medical advice, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

No more spring waves like the first to hit the United States in 2020, no more mid-year surges like the one that turned Hot Vax Summer on its head. Eventually, or so the hope went, SARS-CoV-2 would adhere to the same calendar that many other airway pathogens stick to, at least in temperate parts of the globe: a heavy winter peak, then a summer on sabbatical.<br><br> But three and a half years into the outbreak, the coronavirus is still stubbornly refusing to take the warmest months off. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/covid-19-catch-up-quick">Some</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://caitlinrivers.substack.com/p/this-week-in-outbreaks-july-28-edition">public-health experts</a> are now worried that, after a relatively quiet stretch, the virus is kick-starting yet another summer wave. In the southern and northeastern United States, concentrations of the coronavirus in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://biobot.io/data/">wastewater</a> have been slowly ticking up for several weeks, with the Midwest and West now following suit; test-positivity rates, emergency-department diagnoses of COVID-19, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_new-admissions-rate-county">COVID hospitalizations</a> are also on the rise. The absolute numbers are still small, and they may stay that way. But these are the clear and early signs of a brewing mid-year wave, says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University—which would make this the fourth summer in a row with a distinct coronavirus bump.<br><br> Even this far into the pandemic, though, no one can say for certain whether summer waves are a permanent COVID fixture—or if the virus exhibits a predictable seasonal pattern at all. No law of nature dictates that winters must come with respiratory illness, or that summers will not. “We just don&#39;t know very much about what drives the cyclical patterns of respiratory infections,” says Sam Scarpino, an infectious-disease modeler at Northeastern University. Which means there&#39;s still no part of the year when this virus is guaranteed to cut us any slack.<br><br> That many pathogens <em>do</em> wax and wane with the seasons is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007327">indisputable</a> . In temperate parts of the world, airborne bugs get a boost in winter, only to be stifled in the heat; polio and other feces-borne pathogens, meanwhile, often rise in summer, along with gonorrhea and some other STIs. But noticing these trends is one thing; truly understanding the triggers is another.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/covid-seasonal-winter/620766/">Read: COVID sure looks seasonal now</a><br><br> Some diseases lend themselves a bit more easily to explanation: Near the equator, waves of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5963813/">mosquito-borne illness</a> , such as Zika and Chikungunya, tend to be tied to the weather-dependent life cycles of the insects that carry them; in temperate parts of the world, rates of Lyme disease track with the summertime activity of ticks. Flu, too, has pretty strong data to back its preference for wintry months. The virus—which is sheathed in a fragile, fatty layer called an envelope and travels airborne via moist drops—spreads best when it&#39;s cool and dry, conditions that may help keep infectious particles <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.03452-22">intact</a> and spittle aloft.<br><br> The coronavirus has enough similarities to flu that most experts expect that it will continue to spread in winter too. Both viruses are housed in a sensitive skin; both prefer to move by aerosol. Both are also relatively speedy evolvers that don&#39;t tend to generate long-lasting immunity against infection—factors conducive to repeat waves that hit populations at a fairly stable clip. For those reasons, Anice Lowen, a virologist at Emory University, anticipates that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to show “a clear wintertime seasonality in temperate regions of the world.” Winter is also a time when our bodies can be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445">more susceptible</a> to respiratory bugs: Cold, dry air can interfere with the movement of mucus that shuttles microbes out of the nose and throat; aridity can also make the cells that line those passageways shrivel and die; certain immune defenses might get a bit sleepier, with vitamin D in shorter supply.<br><br> None of that precludes SARS-CoV-2 spread in the heat, even if experts aren&#39;t sure why the virus so easily drives summer waves. Plenty of other microbes manage it: enteroviruses, polio, and more. Even rhinoviruses and adenoviruses, two of the most frequent causes of colds, tend to spread year-round, sometimes showing up in force during the year&#39;s hottest months. (Many scientists presume that has something to do with these viruses&#39; relatively hardy outer layer, but the reason is undoubtedly more complex than that.) An oft-touted explanation for COVID&#39;s summer waves is that people in certain parts of the country retreat indoors to beat the heat. But that argument alone “is weak,” Lowen told me. In industrialized nations, people <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/safety-education/safety-guides/home/indoor-air-pollution-introduction-health-professionals">spend more than 90 percent of their time indoors</a> .<br><br> That said, an accumulation of many small influences can together create a seasonal tipping point. Summer <em>is</em> a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://aytm.com/post/vacations-survey">particularly popular time</a> for travel, often to big gatherings. Many months out from winter and its numerous infections and vaccinations, population immunity might also be at a relative low at this time of year, Rivers said. Plus, for all its similarities to the flu, SARS-CoV-2 is its own beast: It has so far affected people more chronically and more <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/12/covid-common-cold-status-differentiation/672472/">severely</a> , and has generated population-sweeping variants at a far faster pace. Those dynamics can all affect when waves manifest.<br><br> And although certain bodily defenses do dip in the cold, data don&#39;t support the idea that immunity is unilaterally stronger in the summer. Micaela Martinez, the director of environmental health at WE ACT for Environmental Justice, in New York, told me the situation is far more complicated than that. For years, she and other researchers have been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8987173/">gathering</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33817568/">evidence</a> that suggests that our bodies have distinctly seasonal immunological profiles—with some defensive molecules spiking in the summer and another set in winter. The consequences of those shifts aren&#39;t yet apparent. But some of them could help explain when the coronavirus spreads. By the same token, winter is not a time of disease-ridden doom. Xaquin Castro Dopico, an immunologist at the Karolinska Institute, in Sweden, has found that immune systems in the Northern Hemisphere might be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25965853/">more inflammation-prone in the winter</a> —which, yes, could make certain bouts of illness more severe but could also improve <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19889749/">responses</a> to certain vaccinations.<br><br> All of those explanations could apply to COVID&#39;s summer swings—or perhaps none does. “Everybody always wants to have a very simple seasonal answer,” Martinez told me. But one may simply not exist. Even the reasons for the seasonality of polio, a staunch <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4474890/">summertime</a> disease prior to its elimination in the US, have been “an open question” for many decades, Martinez told me.<br><br> Rivers is hopeful that the coronavirus&#39;s permanent patterns may already be starting to peek through: a wintry heyday, and a smaller maybe-summer hump. “We&#39;re in year four, and we&#39;re seeing the same thing year over year,” she told me. But some experts worry that discussions of COVID-19 seasonality are premature. SARS-CoV-2 is still so fresh to the human population that its patterns <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/03/kids-babies-getting-covid-exposure-vaccines/673368/">could be far from their final form</a> . At an extreme, the patterns researchers observed during the first few years of the pandemic may not prelude the future much at all, because they encapsulate so much change: the initial lack and rapid acquisition of immunity, the virus&#39;s evolution, the ebb and flow of masks, and more. Amid that mishmash of countervailing influences, says Brandon Ogbunu, an infectious-disease modeler at Yale, “you&#39;re going to get some counterintuitive dynamics” that won&#39;t necessarily last long term.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/03/kids-babies-getting-covid-exposure-vaccines/673368/">Read: The next stage of COVID is starting now</a><br><br><br> With <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/1_briefing_Global_6.pdf">so much of the world</a> now infected, vaccinated, or both, and COVID mitigations almost entirely gone, the global situation is less in flux now. The virus itself, although still clearly changing at a blistering pace, has not pulled off an Omicron-caliber jump in evolution for more than a year and a half. But no one can yet promise predictability. The cadence of vaccination isn&#39;t yet settled; Scarpino, of Northeastern University, also isn&#39;t ready to dismiss the idea of a viral evolution surprise. Maybe summer waves, to the extent that they&#39;re happening, are a sign that SARS-CoV-2 will remain a microbe for all seasons. Or maybe they&#39;re part of the pandemic&#39;s death rattle—noise in a system that hasn&#39;t yet quieted down.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 29 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/summer-covid-wave-2023/674863/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/summer-covid-wave-2023/674863/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Misunderstood Reason Millions of Americans Stopped Going to Church]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The defining problem driving people out is ... just how American life works in the 21st century. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/SNLWHQRKMYXKJeLjdVhRTWLZR4Q=/0x312:3000x2000/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_455600083/original.jpg" alt="长凳上放着一本圣经。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Spencer Platt / Getty</figcaption></figure> Nearly everyone I grew up with in my childhood church in Lincoln, Nebraska, is no longer Christian. That&#39;s not unusual. Forty million Americans have stopped attending church in the past 25 years. That&#39;s something like 12 percent of the population, and it represents the largest concentrated change in church attendance in American history. As a Christian, I feel this shift acutely. My wife and I wonder whether the institutions and communities that have helped preserve us in our own faith will still exist for our four children, let alone whatever grandkids we might one day have.<br><br> This change is also bad news for America as a whole: Participation in a religious community generally correlates with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/10/28/religion-church-attendance-mortality-column/92676964/">better health outcomes and longer life</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/magazine/less-god-less-giving/">higher financial generosity</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2018/03/20935/">more stable families</a> —all of which are desperately needed in a nation with rising rates of loneliness, mental illness, and alcohol and drug dependency.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/christianity-secularization-america-renewal-modernity/672948/">Timothy Keller: American Christianity is due for a revival</a><br><br> A new book, written by Jim Davis, a pastor at an evangelical church in Orlando, and Michael Graham, a writer with the Gospel Coalition, draws on surveys of more than 7,000 Americans by the political scientists Ryan Burge and Paul Djupe, attempting to explain why people have left churches—or “dechurched,” in the book&#39;s lingo—and what, if anything, can be done to get some people to come back. The book raises an intriguing possibility: What if the problem isn&#39;t that churches are asking too much of their members, but that they aren&#39;t asking nearly enough?<br><br> <i>The Great Dechurching</i> finds that religious abuse and more general moral corruption in churches have driven people away. This is, of course, an indictment of the failures of many leaders who did not address abuse in their church. But Davis and Graham also find that a much larger share of those who have left church have done so for more banal reasons. The book suggests that the defining problem driving out most people who leave is … just how American life works in the 21st century. Contemporary America simply isn&#39;t set up to promote mutuality, care, or common life. Rather, it is designed to maximize individual accomplishment as defined by professional and financial success. Such a system leaves precious little time or energy for forms of community that don&#39;t contribute to one&#39;s own professional life or, as one ages, the professional prospects of one&#39;s children. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/">Workism</a> reigns in America, and because of it, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.html">community in America</a> , religious community included, is a math problem that doesn&#39;t add up.<br><br> Numerous victims of abuse in church environments can identify a moment when they lost the ability to believe, when they almost felt their faith draining out of them. The book shows, though, that for most Americans who were once a part of churches but have since left, the process of leaving was gradual, and in many cases they didn&#39;t realize it was even happening until it already had. It&#39;s less like jumping off a cliff and more like driving down a slope, eventually realizing that you can no longer see the place you started from.<br><br> Consider one of the composite characters that Graham and Davis use in the book to describe a typical evangelical dechurcher: a 30-something woman who grew up in a suburban megachurch, was heavily invested in a campus ministry while in college, then after graduating moved into a full-time job and began attending a young-adults group in a local church. In her 20s, she meets a guy who is less religiously engaged, they get married, and, at some point early in their marriage, after their first or second child is born, they stop going to church. Maybe the baby isn&#39;t sleeping well and when Sunday morning comes around, it is simply easier to stay home and catch whatever sleep is available as the baby (finally) falls asleep.<br><br> In other cases, a person might be entering mid-career, working a high-stress job requiring a 60- or 70-hour workweek. Add to that 15 hours of commute time, and suddenly something like two-thirds of their waking hours in the week are already accounted for. And so when a friend invites them to a Sunday-morning brunch, they probably want to go to church, but they also want to see that friend, because they haven&#39;t been able to see them for months. The friend wins out.<br><br> After a few weeks of either scenario, the thought of going to church on Sunday carries a certain mental burden with it—you might <i>want</i> to go, but you also dread the inevitable questions about where you have been. “I skipped church to go to brunch with a friend” or “I was just too tired to come” don&#39;t sound like convincing excuses as you rehearse the conversation in your mind. Soon it actually sounds like it&#39;d be harder to attend than to skip, even if some part of you still wants to go. The underlying challenge for many is that their lives are stretched like a rubber band about to snap—and church attendance ends up feeling like an item on a checklist that&#39;s already too long.<br><br> What can churches do in such a context? In theory, the Christian Church could be an antidote to all that. What is more needed in our time than a community marked by sincere love, sharing what they have from each according to their ability and to each according to their need, eating together regularly, generously serving neighbors, and living lives of quiet virtue and prayer? A healthy church can be a safety net in the harsh American economy by offering its members material assistance in times of need: meals after a baby is born, money for rent after a layoff. Perhaps more important, it reminds people that their identity is not in their job or how much money they make; they are children of God, loved and protected and infinitely valuable.<br><br> But a vibrant, life-giving church requires more, not less, time and energy from its members. It asks people to prioritize one another over our career, to prioritize prayer and time reading scripture over accomplishment. This may seem like a tough sell in an era of dechurching. If people are already leaving—especially if they are leaving because they feel too busy and burned out to attend church regularly—why would they want to be part of a church that asks so much of them?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/us-religious-affiliation-rates-declining/672729/">Read: American religion is not dead yet</a><br><br> Although understandable, that isn&#39;t quite the right question. The problem in front of us is not that we have a healthy, sustainable society that doesn&#39;t have room for church. The problem is that many Americans have adopted a way of life that has left us lonely, anxious, and uncertain of how to live in community with other people.<br><br> The tragedy of American churches is that they have been so caught up in this same world that we now find they have nothing to offer these suffering people that can&#39;t be more easily found somewhere else. American churches have too often been content to function as a kind of vaguely spiritual NGO, an organization of detached individuals who meet together for religious services that inspire them, provide practical life advice, or offer positive emotional experiences. Too often it has not been a community that through its preaching and living bears witness to another way to live.<br><br> The theologian Stanley Hauerwas <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.christiancentury.org/article/interview/dangers-providing-pastoral-care">captured the problem well</a> when he said that “pastoral care has become obsessed with the personal wounds of people in advanced industrial societies who have discovered that their lives lack meaning.” The difficulty is that many of the wounds and aches provoked by our current order aren&#39;t of a sort that can be managed or life-hacked away. They are resolved only by changing one&#39;s life, by becoming a radically different sort of person belonging to a radically different sort of community.<br><br> Last fall, I spent several days in New York City, during which time I visited a home owned by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bruderhof.com/">a group of pacifist Christians</a> that lives from a common purse—meaning the members do not have privately held property but share their property and money. Their simple life and shared finances allow their schedules to be more flexible, making for a thicker immediate community and greater generosity to neighbors, as well as a richer life of prayer and private devotion to God, all supported by a deep commitment to their church.<br><br> This is, admittedly, an extreme example. But this community was thriving not because it found ways to scale down what it asked of its members but because it found a way to scale up what they provided to one another. Their way of living frees them from the treadmill of workism. Work, in this community, is judged not by the money it generates but by the people it serves. In a workist culture that believes <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/dignity-beyond-accomplishment">dignity is grounded in accomplishment</a> , simply reclaiming this alternative form of dignity becomes a radical act.<br><br> In the Gospels, Jesus tells his first disciples to leave their old way of life behind, going so far as abandoning their plow or fishing nets where they are and, if necessary, even leaving behind their parents. A church that doesn&#39;t expect at least this much from one another isn&#39;t really a church in the way Jesus spoke about it. If Graham and Davis are right, it also is likely a church that won&#39;t survive the challenges facing us today.<br><br> The great dechurching could be the beginning of a new moment for churches, a moment marked less by aspiration to respectability and success, with less focus on individuals aligning themselves with American values and assumptions. We could be a witness to another way of life outside conventionally American measures of success. Churches could model better, truer sorts of communities, ones in which the hungry are fed, the weak are lifted up, and the proud are cast down. Such communities might not have the money, success, and influence that many American churches have so often pursued in recent years. But if such communities look less like those churches, they might also look more like the sorts of communities Jesus expected his followers to create.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 29 Jul 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/</item></channel></rss>
