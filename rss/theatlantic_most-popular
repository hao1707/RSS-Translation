“我们有责任进入这些机构，看看它们是如何被武器化来对抗它们本应代表的人民的，” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-gop-eyes-new-committee-probe-weaponization-federal-government-rcna64727">担任该机构主席的特朗普盟友众议员吉姆·乔丹 (Jim Jordan) 说</a>。甚至不那么特朗普派的成员，比如共和党建制派坚定支持者汤姆·科尔<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/10/us/politics/house-republican-committee-weaponization-government.html">也表示同意</a>：“不可否认的是，近年来，联邦政府行政部门经常出于政治目的滥用权力并侵犯美国公民的公民自由。”<br><br>从那时起，该小组委员会举行了一系列会议，并提出了各种不成熟的想法，其中许多与乔·拜登的儿子亨特有关。它没有提供任何明确且令人信服的政府渎职证据，当然也没有提供与 20 世纪 70 年代教会委员会相媲美的证据，共和党人将其视为典范。<br><br>也许乔丹只是看错了地方。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">特别检察官杰克·史密斯昨天获得的</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149/gov.uscourts.dcd.258149.1.0_1.pdf">起诉书</a>提供了一个完美的例子，恰好说明了乔丹所说的他正在寻求的司法部武器化。唯一的问题是，这是特朗普及其盟友为了继续掌权而进行的，违背了美国人民的意愿。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">大卫·A·格雷厄姆：特朗普试图对美国民主进行公然、极其严重的攻击</a><br><br>让我们首先定义<i>武器化</i>。不同的政府会有不同的政策愿望和对法律的解释。有时，这可能会演变成不良行为——民主党人抱怨特朗普在冠状病毒大流行初期<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-democratic-governors-cuomo/609124/">公开支持红色州</a>，共和党人<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/07/the-federal-takeover-of-state-governments/375270/">抱怨</a>巴拉克·奥巴马不恰当地胁迫州政府扩大福利——尽管这本质上并不是非法或不道德的。<br><br>但如果一个联邦机构为了获得政治或选举结果的明确目的而在官方掩护下提出虚假主张，那么这似乎就是政府武器化的一个直接例子。这正是史密斯所指控的：“2020 年 12 月下旬，被告试图利用司法部，通过代理总检察长签名的正式信件，向目标州的官员故意谎称选举舞弊，从而揭穿了被告的谎言。联邦政府的支持，并试图不当影响目标州，以用被告取代合法的[乔]拜登选举人。”<br><br>起诉书称，在此期间，一名同谋——情况表明他是时任助理司法部长杰弗里·克拉克(Jeffrey Clark)——在白宫与特朗普会面，这违反了司法部的规定。经过这些讨论，克拉克起草了一封致佐治亚州立法机构的信，他建议代理总检察长和副总检察长签署这封信，错误地指出司法部“发现了可能影响多个州选举结果的重大问题”；司法部认为已向国会提交了两组独立的有效选举人；立法机关应该召开一次特别会议来决定将进行哪项选举——显然是希望共和党领导的立法机关选出虚假的特朗普选举人名单。<br><br>史密斯没有将起诉书中的所有要点联系起来， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/leave-rest-me/619621/">但众议院 1 月 6 日委员会却做到了</a>。根据调查，其目标是不让司法部采取除这封信之外的任何其他行动。特朗普只是想让这封信制造怀疑，给共和党国会议员拒绝1月6日选举结果的借口。“别指望你会这么做，只说选举腐败+剩下的交给我，根据代理副总检察长理查德·多诺霍 (Richard Donoghue) 的笔记，特朗普这样说道。<br><br>虚假调查是特朗普最喜欢的策略。他在2019年对乌克兰进行敲诈勒索时曾试图使用这一手段，当时他明确表示，他并不关心乌克兰是否真的调查了拜登家族在当地的业务， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/all-trump-cared-about-was-announcing-investigation/602335/">只关心乌克兰<i>宣布了</i>一项他可以用于政治目的的调查</a>。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/its-all-about-the-investigation/616836/">2020 年 10 月下旬，在发生了另一个有关亨特·拜登的模糊故事后，他再次尝试了这一举动</a>。特朗普明白，实际的调查并不重要——事实上，如果调查揭穿了指控，他可能会受到伤害——但丑闻的气味可能对他有帮助。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/its-all-about-the-investigation/616836/">大卫·A·格雷厄姆：一切都与调查有关</a><br><br>多诺霍拒绝在克拉克的信上签名，并重申这些说法是错误的。但克拉克并没有松懈。他告诉他的老板，特朗普将任命他为代理司法部长，但如果他们签署这封信，他会拒绝。 1 月 3 日，特朗普向他提供了这份工作，克拉克接受了。当天晚上，多诺霍和代理司法部长杰弗里·罗森来见特朗普，并告诉他，如果克拉克被任命，司法部将面临大规模辞职。直到那时，特朗普才放弃了该计划。<br><br>这些指控尚未在法庭上得到证实，但不需要太多信心就可以接受。 <i>《华盛顿邮报》</i> 、 <i>《纽约时报》</i>和<i>《华尔街日报》</i>均<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/jeffrey-clark-justice-department-trump-coup/617818/">在 2021 年 1 月（即事件发生几周后）报道了该阴谋的基本主旨</a>。众议院 1 月 6 日委员会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/its-all-about-the-investigation/616836/">在宣誓证词中添加了更多细节</a>。 （该委员会也许更应该承担调查政府武器化的职责。）特朗普竞选团队在昨天关于起诉书的声明中甚至没有对这些指控提出异议。<br><br>正如起诉书指出的那样，这一所谓共谋的目标是“伤害、压迫、威胁和恐吓一个或多个自由行使和享有美国宪法和法律赋予他们的权利和特权的人——也就是说，投票权和投票权被计算在内。”汤姆·科尔是对的：不可否认的是，联邦政府出于政治目的滥用了权力。他只是应该更具体地说明这些虐待行为是为哪位总统和哪个政党服务的。<br><br></div>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mickryan.substack.com/p/the-state-of-the-ukraine-campaign">苏罗维金防线</a>，该防线以设计俄罗斯在乌克兰防御阵地的将军的名字命名（他现在显然受到某种形式的控制）。拘留——一名莫斯科<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66183656">官员称</a>他正在“休息”——因为他明显与叛乱分子叶夫根尼·普里戈任有牵连）。正如<i>《</i><i>堡垒》</i>高级编辑本杰明·帕克<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://plus.thebulwark.com/p/the-three-battles-raging-in-ukraine?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2">周一指出的</a>那样，这实际上并不是一条线，而是“一系列有时深达数英里的雷区、坦克陷阱、战壕、诱杀装置和其他防御工事的区域”，而乌克兰人缺乏西方军队通常用来克服此类障碍的侦察和火力。<br><br>尽管如此，还是出现了一些充满希望的迹象。一方面，乌克兰人发起进攻这一事实<i>本身</i>就是一个奇迹。正如我的朋友兼俄罗斯观察家尼克·格沃斯德夫（Nick Gvosdev）最近向我指出的那样，美国人倾向于认为军事冲突与动作片具有相同的叙事情节：好人一开始就踢屁股，经历了一段艰难的时期。<i>洛基</i>般的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://collider.com/best-training-montages-from-rocky-creed-ranked/">训练和恢复蒙太奇</a>，然后粉碎坏人。那不是现实；那是现实。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/06/putin-nuclear-ukraine-counteroffensive/674462/">正如我今年夏天早些时候警告的那样</a>，戏剧性的哨声吹响和战壕里的冲锋永远不会发生。<br><br>但乌克兰幸存下来，并在战场和俄罗斯首都与敌人作战。一年半多前，俄罗斯最初的计划是在几天内消灭乌克兰这个国家。相反，俄罗斯人抱怨<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/world/europe/ukraine-drone-strikes-russia.html">乌克兰无人机反复袭击</a>莫斯科市中心，而弗拉基米尔·普京总统的军队正在割让被占领土，尽管进展缓慢。<br><br>这些无人机攻击规模较小且无效——事实上，规模如此之小，以至于去年春天<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/05/what-happens-if-russia-stashes-nukes-in-belarus/674221/?utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_term=2023-05-26T22%3A12%3A59&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">我对它们的起源的第一个猜测</a>是，它们是俄罗斯的假旗行动。但它们对普京政权产生了巨大的心理影响。早在 2022 年，普京就与他的公民达成了隐含的协议：这场战争将是光荣的、短暂的，并且远离俄罗斯。<br><br>莫斯科<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66368016">最新的无人机</a>袭击了一些政府机构所在的摩天大楼。没有造成人员伤亡，但打碎了很多玻璃；显然，这也爆料了俄罗斯外交部发言人玛丽亚·扎哈罗娃(Maria Zakharova)，她<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/steven_pifer/status/1686366890099425280?s=20">将这次袭击比作9/11</a> 。扎哈罗娃比我更清楚，因为我在 9/11 事件发生几周后就在莫斯科。当时俄罗斯首都的气氛很阴沉，但对美国游客来说却充满同情。俄罗斯人知道 9/11 的严重性，普京的走狗现在援引这次袭击，既表明了他们的愤世嫉俗，也表明了他们的羞辱。毕竟，乌克兰人此时应该正在建造以普京命名的学校，而不是用深夜的爆炸来刺激克里姆林宫的神经。<br><br>乌克兰军队还<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/world/europe/ukraine-counteroffensive-russia.html">夺回了斯塔罗迈尔斯克村，</a>这是向南行动的一部分，这可能会危及俄罗斯的补给线。有<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/31/1189986016/russiB-ukraine-war-news">报道</a>称，扎波罗热地区的袭击正在加速，俄罗斯人在欧洲最大核电站周围的地区挖掘并埋设了地雷。 （俄罗斯人则<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/world/europe/ukraine-counteroffensive.html">声称</a>乌克兰人对扎波罗热发动了“大规模”攻击，但请记住，夸大乌克兰每次攻击的规模符合俄罗斯的利益：如果俄罗斯的防御坚守，他们就击退了攻击，但如果他们倒下了，那就是一次“大规模”攻击。）<br><br>俄罗斯绝望的另一个潜在迹象是： <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-wagner-fighters-move-closer-polish-border-poland-pm-says-2023-07-29/">波兰人报告说</a>，来自普里戈任瓦格纳集团的大约 100 名雇佣兵可能正在从邻国的新家接近波兰边境，这些人曾是乌克兰的有效战士，并于 6 月份差点进军莫斯科。白俄罗斯。 （波兰还<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/02/europe/poland-belarus-wagner-nato-tensions-intl/index.html">指责</a>白俄罗斯侵犯波兰领空。）<br><br>白俄罗斯总统、普京的同僚独裁者亚历山大·卢卡申科一直在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/lukashenko-taunts-poland-again-over-wagner-troops-near-border-2023-08-01/">嘲讽</a>波兰人，称华沙应该感谢他控制了瓦格纳的军队，但很难确切知道普京或普里戈任认为他们在对波兰人挥舞这把小刀是在做什么。北约国家。美国驻联合国大使琳达·托马斯·格林菲尔德<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://usun.usmission.gov/remarks-by-ambassador-linda-thomas-greenfield-at-a-virtual-new-york-foreign-press-center-briefing-on-the-u-s-presidency-of-the-un-security-council/">周一表示</a>，瓦格纳雇佣军的袭击将被美国视为“俄罗斯政府的袭击”，如果普京认为试图激怒波兰人会以某种方式如果削弱北约对乌克兰的支持，那么他仍然不明白他所造成的灾难的性质。<br><br>我并不太担心瓦格纳的波将金哑剧，我也不认为俄罗斯人真的相信他们正在经历一场新的 9/11。但我担心美国人和西方其他国家不了解乌克兰人面临的艰巨任务，乌克兰人必须夺回已变成死亡陷阱的地狱般的领土。在此关键时刻，美国及其盟国应加快援助速度。正如我的同事戴维·弗鲁姆一年多前所<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1535794951002497030?s=20">恳求的</a>那样：“如果乌克兰可以在从温哥华到维尔纽斯的任何北约仓库中使用任何东西，那就是丑闻。清空所有库存。”<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link"

“这并不容易，所以我们不应该回避这一点。”<br><br>与此同时，无人机和战壕的夏天将继续下去——这是必然的。<br><br><b>有关的：</b><br><br><li> <a

<i>《判决》</i>在我心中占有特殊的地位，因为我的工作地点就是一些关键场景的拍摄地。<br><br> 1982年初，我还是一名大学生，同时也是马萨诸塞州议会大厦的全职立法助理。<i>判决书</i>将州议会大厦兼作虚构的圣凯瑟琳拉布尔医院。导演显然想要一种破旧的、大萧条时代的感觉，就像同年开始播出的 NBC 电视剧<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083483/"><i>《圣别处》</i></a>中的圣埃利吉乌斯一样。这座拥有石墙和瓷砖地板的州议会大厦与一座灯火通明、经过消毒处理的现代化医院形成鲜明对比。

年大选，可能是遏制他对美国民主造成的威胁所必需的。但这可能还不够。<br><br>特朗普向美国政治体系注入的拒绝选举主义的萌芽已在整个共和党内蔓延，几乎可以肯定，无论这位前总统面临何种法律责任，共和党都将幸免于难。<br><br>民意调查显示，大多数共和党选民仍然认为选举被特朗普窃取，1月6日的骚乱是合法的抗议，特朗普颠覆2020年选举结果的努力没有违反法律或威胁宪法制度，美国面临着形势严峻且前所未有。我们两个主要政党之一的主导派别一再表现出愿意接受反民主手段来促进其利益，这在美国现代历史上还是第一次。<br><br>共和党内部这种动态最能说明问题的指标是特朗普仍然是该党的核心人物。每当共和党选民和领导人有机会离开他时——无论是在 1 月 6 日之后的震惊中，还是在 2022 年选举期间对他精心挑选的候选人表现不佳感到普遍失望——该党都迅速超越了他的立场。坡道。<br><br>现在的民意调查显示，特朗普在 2024 年共和党总统竞选中领先，这是两党初选候选人有史以来最大的领先优势之一。众议院的共和党多数派一直在探索如何消除他的两次弹劾和/或阻止他面临的调查。即使是表面上与他竞争 2024 年共和党提名的其他候选人也几乎一致谴责针对他的起诉，而不是他的潜在行为。 <a data-event-element="inline link"

</b>大多数众议院共和党人投票否决了选举结果，大多数共和党州总检察长提起诉讼，要求取消乔·拜登总统赢得的关键摇摆州的选举结果。选举结束后，大多数共和党控制的州受到特朗普毫无根据的选民欺诈行为指控的启发， <a data-event-element="inline link"

</b>“manipulate the apparatus of government or elections in order to subvert the will of the people.”<br><br> The closest parallel to Trump&#39;s actions, Wilentz said, may be the strategies of the slaveholding South in the decades before the Civil War. Those included violent attacks on abolitionists, suppression of antislavery publications, and the promulgation of extreme legal theories such as the denial of basic rights to Black people in the Supreme Court&#39;s 1857 <i>Dred Scott</i> decision, all of which were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/10/biden-2020-trump-election/616912/">designed to protect slavery against the emerging national majority dubious of it</a> . That decades-long “antidemocratic thrust” from the South, Wilentz noted, “finally culminated in the greatest violation of the American Constitution in our history, which was secession.”<br><br> By contrast, Wilentz added, the GOP&#39;s continued embrace of Trump amid the evidence of his misconduct contrasts sharply with the party&#39;s refusal to defend Richard Nixon in the final stages of Watergate. “When Richard Nixon was about to be impeached, he didn&#39;t storm the Capitol to get rid of Barry Goldwater,” Wilentz said, referring to the conservative Republican senator who warned Nixon that he would lose a Senate vote to remove him. “He resigned.”<br><br> All of this suggests that personal accountability for Trump is unlikely to erase the tolerance for antidemocratic actions that has spread in the GOP since his emergence. Yet many experts who study the health of democracy still believe that prosecuting him remains essential.<br><br> Kristy Parker, a counsel at Protect Democracy, a bipartisan group that focuses on threats to democratic institutions, says it is crucial to show the “silent majority” of Americans who support the constitutional system that no one is above the law. “They need to see that the Department of Justice prosecutors are willing to take the risk of indicting Trump,” Parker told me. “They need to see the election workers ensuring that people get their vote counted. They need to see the police officers standing up to the rioters. They need to see people within the system working.”<br><br> Michael Waldman, the president and CEO of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School, told me that he has been ambivalent about indicting former presidents, because of the risk of precipitating a retaliatory spiral between the parties. “It is a line that we as a country have never crossed,” Waldman said shortly after the Trump indictment was disclosed last night. “One could imagine how it could be abused and become one more shattered norm.”<br><br> Waldman said that failing to indict Trump would have been far more dangerous, because such a decision would have suggested that there is no effective way to hold presidents accountable for misbehavior. Neither of Trump&#39;s two impeachments really damaged his position in the party, Waldman noted, in part because virtually all GOP elected officials defended his behavior. But the multiple criminal indictments facing Trump, he said, show that “the criminal-justice system still is producing tangible legal consequences” that future presidents cannot brush off as easily as an impeachment.<br><br> Waldman said the trials of hundreds of January 6 rioters already demonstrate that prosecution can have some deterrent effect. Unruly crowds of supporters, Waldman noted, did not descend on courthouses in Manhattan or Florida after Trump&#39;s earlier indictments, despite his signals that he&#39;d like to see that happen. “The fact that this stuff is not just a bad idea but illegal and you can go to jail for it really makes a big difference,” Waldman said.<br><br> John Dean, the White House counsel whose Senate testimony helped doom Nixon during Watergate, also considers prosecution of Trump to be “essential,” he told me. President Gerald Ford&#39;s decision to pardon Nixon and preempt a trial, Dean said, was “a historical disaster,” because it emboldened presidents to believe they would never face criminal charges for their actions. Allowing Trump to avoid consequences, Dean believes, would send an even more dangerous signal than Ford did with Nixon. “Trump&#39;s corruption is so much more fundamental to the system than Nixon&#39;s,” Dean said. “Nixon, he abused power, he had his enemies list, he wanted to make government work for the benefit of Republicans and not Democrats. But he wasn&#39;t going after the foundations of government and the system like Trump.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indictment-gop-trial/674813/">Peter Wehner: The indictment of Donald Trump—and his enablers</a><br><br> Trump&#39;s effort to overturn the 2020 election required the cooperation of many other GOP officials and conservative activists and lawyers. Now a growing number of them face consequences of their own, including disbarment proceedings, ongoing state and local investigations, and the potential of further federal charges from Special Counsel Jack Smith against the six unnamed co-conspirators listed in the Trump indictment.<br><br> “I&#39;m not sure how much additional prosecutions will deter Trump—unfortunately, he&#39;s all-in on winning as a way to stay out of prison at this point,” says the Dartmouth College political scientist Brendan Nyhan, a co-founder of Bright Line Watch, a collaborative of political scientists studying threats to US democracy. “But Republican operatives and activists may hesitate as the evidence mounts that participating in an attempted coup puts you in legal jeopardy. That&#39;s important, because Trump can&#39;t carry out his plots by himself.”<br><br> Some analysts have worried that the trials could strengthen Trump if die-hard supporters of his on a jury refuse to convict him regardless of the evidence. But Parker told me that cannot be allowed to dissuade prosecutors from bringing cases when there&#39;s evidence that Trump violated the law. The problem, she said, is analogous to the challenges she faced as a Department of Justice civil-rights attorney prosecuting excessive-force cases against police officers who were likely more popular in the community than the victims they abused: “You can&#39;t just give in and allow, effectively, a bully to force his way out of accountability, because then you&#39;ve crushed the ideal that no one is above the law.”<br><br> Yet although all these possible sanctions create <i>legal</i> reasons for the GOP to resist another Trump-led attack on democracy, the party&#39;s <i>political</i> incentives point in the opposite direction.<br><br> A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://brightlinewatch.org/uncharted-territory-the-aftermath-of-presidential-indictments/">recent national poll released by the Bright Line Watch project</a> found that the majority of Republican voters accepted all of Trump&#39;s key arguments about 2020 and the multiplying legal challenges accumulating against him. In that survey, only small minorities of Republicans said that he had committed crimes in any of the cases he&#39;s facing. Most Republicans said Trump was singled out for prosecution for behavior that would not have prompted charges against other people. Six in 10 Republicans described the January 6 riot as “legitimate protest.” And although the share of Republicans who said that Biden was elected through fraud had declined somewhat from its peak of about three-fourths, nearly two-thirds of them still denied the legitimacy of his victory.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indictment-jan-6-committee-jack-smith/674889/">Quinta Jurecic: The triumph of the January 6 Committee</a><br><br> These attitudes provide an ominous backdrop to Trump&#39;s hints that if he wins the nomination but loses the general election, he&#39;s likely to challenge the results again. Trump might not attempt another mass physical attack on the Capitol in 2025, but such sentiments could allow him to enlist Republicans again for a more targeted legal effort to overthrow the results in a few key states or in Congress, Nyhan told me. The widespread Republican rejection of the idea that Trump violated any laws in his actions after 2020 offers reason to doubt that the party would object any more strenuously if he launched another campaign to delegitimize the results in 2024.<br><br> Nyhan said he can imagine future circumstances in which Democrats at some point challenge the legitimacy of a presidential race, such as the election coming down to a Republican-controlled state that has restricted voting rights. But he said the more immediate danger is that Republicans won&#39;t accept any presidential race they lose. Traditionally, presidential nominees from each party, including Al Gore and John McCain, have made statements in which “the losing side specifically affirms the legitimacy of the winner,” Nyhan said. But for the GOP next year, he added, “we can no longer take that for granted whether or not Trump is the nominee, and that&#39;s really worrisome.”<br><br> Trump may constitute a unique threat to America&#39;s democratic traditions. But he has always <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/01/capitol-riot-and-white-conservatives-extremism/617615/">connected his claims of pervasive electoral fraud to the widespread anxiety among white, Christian conservatives</a> that they are losing control of the country to a racially diverse, secular, and LGBTQ-friendly Democratic coalition centered in the nation&#39;s largest cities. As Trump put it during one 2020 rally before a predominantly white, rural audience in Georgia: “This is <i>our</i> country. And you know this, and you see it, but they are trying to take it from us through rigging, fraud, deception, and deceit.” Whether Trump is convicted for trying to overturn the 2020 election or not, voters who accept that argument will remain the most powerful force in the GOP coalition. And they will continue to demand leaders who will fight the changes that they believe threaten their position in American society.<br><br> Those other Republican leaders may not attempt to overturn an election as brazenly as Trump did with the conduct Smith catalogs in his indictment. But, as Wilentz told me, for the foreseeable future, they are likely to pursue other means “toward the same end: that majoritarian democracy cannot be tolerated under any circumstances if the outcome is not what you wanted it to be.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 19:08:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trump-indictment-gop-jan-6/674895/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trump-indictment-gop-jan-6/674895/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Vladimir Putin and the Parable of the ‘Cornered Rat’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> We may be getting the moral of the Russian leader&#39;s childhood story all wrong. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/501CQ3RXYB3rSHU9DZZ_5T7o36w=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/RatInACorner/original.png" alt="一只老鼠站在涂有俄罗斯国旗白、蓝、红条纹的角落里。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by The Atlantic; Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> Rarely have so few, seemingly inconsequential words generated so many consequential ones.<br><br> In a mere 109-word paragraph tucked away in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/first/p/putin-first.html">an autobiographical collection of interviews</a> published in 2000, just as he ascended to power in Russia, Vladimir Putin tells a nightmarish tale: Once, when he and his friends were chasing rats with sticks in the dilapidated apartment building in St. Petersburg where he grew up, a “huge rat” he&#39;d cornered suddenly “lashed around and threw itself at” him, chasing the “surprised and frightened” Putin to his door before he slammed it shut in the rodent&#39;s face. For Putin, it&#39;s a parable: “I got a quick and lasting lesson in the meaning of the word <em>cornered</em> .”<br><br> More than two decades later, that anecdotal seed has sprouted into a ubiquitous narrative that has helped shape the West&#39;s response to Russia&#39;s war against Ukraine. A cornered Putin, commentators and policy makers in the United States and Europe have frequently insisted, could behave like the rat, lashing out even with weapons of mass destruction if provoked. The assumption has informed policies on arms provisions to Ukraine and nuclear deterrence against Russia.<br><br> Yet the Russian leader&#39;s response to Yevgeny Prigozhin&#39;s failed mutiny in June has called the cornered-rat concept into question. Some experts argue that Russian propaganda amplified the metaphor, and that Putin&#39;s reaction to the rebellion exposed it as a lie.

Is Putin now that cornered rat he once encountered?”<br><br> References to the tale tend to crop up when Putin is either issuing nuclear threats or under intense economic or military pressure, and they have become so common that experts often describe Putin as a “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/03/29/opinion/ukraine-war-putin.html">cornered</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.realcleardefense.com/articles/2022/10/18/deterring_a_cornered_rat_making_putin_think_twice_about_the_use_of_nuclear_weapons_859677.html">rat</a> ” or even “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-10525223/Vladimir-Putin-snarling-rat-backed-corner-writes-IAN-BIRRELL.html">a snarling rat backed into a corner</a> ,” with nary a mention of the childhood story that spawned the metaphor.

Shortly after Putin&#39;s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, for example, the journalist Masha Gessen <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/how-putin-wants-russians-to-see-the-war-in-ukraine">wrote</a> that the rat story “keeps coming up in my conversations in Moscow” and that “no one who has ever heard it doubts that the adult Putin identifies with the rat.”<br><br> Around the same time, the Cold War historian Vladislav Zubok told me he was alarmed by those in the West who “keep shouting, &#39;Press this guy Putin against the wall. Squash him like a rat! Kill him!&#39; And this guy has a nuclear button. Come on! Don&#39;t make him nervous.” Andrei​ Kolesnikov, a Moscow-based expert on Russian politics at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, wrote to me that, in his opinion, the cornered-rat image “is very accurate.” He noted that Putin “responds to every challenge (eg damage to the Crimean bridge) with a brutal attack (eg missile strikes).”<br><br> But other experts—such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJXxmbtaiM8">Polyakova</a> , who studies disinformation, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/news/transcripts/an-expert-briefing-on-the-wagner-mutiny-and-whats-next-for-russia-and-ukraine/">Herbst</a> , a former US ambassador to Ukraine—argue that Putin and the Kremlin have intentionally spread the image of Putin as a cornered rat as a form of propaganda, a verminous spin on Richard Nixon&#39;s “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/nukevault/ebb517-Nixon-Kissinger-and-the-Madman-Strategy-during-Vietnam-War/">Madman Theory</a> .” They hypothesize that Putin, as a former KGB agent during the Cold War, would have been well versed in psychological operations and thus likely had a calculated reason to repeatedly relay the rat story and the lesson he drew from it.<br><br> Whether or not Putin had an ulterior motive in sharing the rat story, Herbst told me, the Russian leader and “his henchmen” have emphasized the trope over the years “to instill fear in Western policy makers and also in policy makers in smaller, closer-by countries” that if they oppose Putin getting what he wants, he will strike back in devastating ways. Putin doesn&#39;t have to repeat the story often, Herbst said, because the West has done the work for him by amplifying its theme.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2005/03/the-accidental-autocrat/303725/">Read: The accidental autocrat</a><br><br> As striking as the story&#39;s repetition is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/07/08/vladimir-putin-backs-down-russia-ukraine/">the frequency</a> with which it has failed to predict Putin&#39;s behavior. Faced with Yevgeny Prigozhin&#39;s June rebellion—as mercenaries marched toward Moscow—Putin&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/07/25/putin-prigozhin-rebellion-kremlin-disarray/">reaction</a> was not to lunge forward but rather to back away, negotiate with the Wagner Group leader, and make concessions to the mutineers to defuse the crisis.<br><br> Polyakova considers Putin&#39;s behavior during the episode consistent with a broader pattern that even predates the current conflict: “In every instance where we [in the West] have pushed back against either Russian aggression or Russia&#39;s economic interests, there hasn&#39;t been this &#39;all hell breaks loose&#39; response.”<br><br> Herbst agrees. He points out that Western countries have repeatedly crossed ostensible Russian red lines—by providing advanced weapons to Ukraine, for example, or admitting Finland and Sweden into NATO—without Putin resorting to nuclear use or other major escalations. And yet, the notion persists, perhaps usefully to Putin, that he must not be forced on the ropes or he will unleash World War III.<br><br> Natalia Gevorkyan was one of three Russian journalists who spoke with Putin for the 2000 autobiographical interviews. She told me she doubts that the Russian leader deliberately planted the rat story as propaganda—at least in its initial telling. Putin didn&#39;t know in advance the questions the journalists would be asking, and he volunteered the anecdote only when they pressed him on whether the conditions at the communal apartment where he grew up were as horrible as a former teacher of his had suggested.<br><br> The Kremlin had encouraged Putin to “talk openly” about himself so that the interviews would introduce him to Russians who “didn&#39;t know anything about him” at the time, Gevorkyan said. Stories like the one about the rats seemed intended to fulfill that directive.<br><br> “Nobody was cornering him” back in 2000, Gevorkyan reasoned. “I don&#39;t believe that he was that smart to say, &#39;Look, guys, listen to this story and never push me into the corner.&#39;” She conceded that it&#39;s “quite possible” he has sent a political message by repeating the story and its lesson in the ensuing years.<br><br> But Gevorkyan, who is now based in Paris, did challenge the conventional interpretation of the story. She wonders why so many people ( <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/documentary/putins-way/transcript/?">herself included</a> , until she looked at the tale in a new light after Russia&#39;s assault against Ukraine last year) gravitate toward a convoluted reading of it that associates Putin with the dangerous rodent. The more straightforward moral of the story is that a frightened young Vladimir backed off when threatened, and that the elder Vladimir might do the same under similar circumstances. Something about the tale, she mused, tempts people to concentrate on the pouncing rat rather than the fleeing boy.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/putin-prigozhin-belarus/674523/">Read: Why Putin let Prigozhin go</a><br><br> Putin had a stick that he could have used to protect himself against the much smaller animal. Instead, Gevorkyan said, “he runs away and he hides in his own apartment and he feels safe. For me, this is much more a story about Putin than about the rat.”<br><br> No one but Putin himself will ever know for sure if, when push comes to shove, he is the cornered rat, the frightened boy, or something else entirely. But policy makers and the public can pay particularly close attention to what Putin <em>does</em> rather than what he says or what others say about him, and build their understanding of the Russian leader on a foundation of empirical evidence. They can avoid the siren song of popular frameworks that offer simplistic explanatory models for a complicated geopolitical actor. They can design policies and strategies to defend their interests that factor in their best assessments of Putin, while not accepting as gospel any single measure of the man and how he might behave.<br><br> Aleksandar Matovski, an assistant professor at the Naval Postgraduate School, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/book/33649/chapter-abstract/288181474?redirectedFrom=fulltext">has studied</a> the connection between Putin&#39;s military adventurism abroad and his political standing at home. He told me that he sees some limited but significant truth in the cornered-rat paradigm: “There is a genuine threshold at which cornered Putin (in the sense of losing his grip domestically) would lash out aggressively, as a fall from power for a personalized dictator like him would be catastrophic,” he wrote to me, noting that his comments constitute his own assessment and not the position of the US Department of Defense. But he also underscored the evidence that has piled up against the paradigm. Putin has “exploited the fear of the &#39;cornered rat&#39; as a sort of bluff, particularly through nuclear blackmail in recent years,” he observed.<br><br> To avoid a situation in which a weakened Putin in dire circumstances blunders into nuclear use, Matovski argued, Western officials will need “to appeal to the survivalist outlook of Putin and his elite by signaling determination to retaliate in ways that will deny the Kremlin the benefits of a nuclear strike” and exert painful pressure on the Putin regime.<br><br> In other words, to manage the risk of nuclear escalation with Russia, they shouldn&#39;t dismiss offhand the man who once saw in a cornered rat a warning about the dangers of desperation. But they should nevertheless appeal to the survival instincts of the boy with the stick who, when faced with those dangers, decided to run for it.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/putin-russia-ukraine-war-cornered-rat-story/674890/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/08/putin-russia-ukraine-war-cornered-rat-story/674890/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[An Unsettling Hint at How Much Fraud Could Exist in Science]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Two experts on dishonesty are separately accused of tampering with data for the same research paper.

Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> <small><em>Updated at 5:24 pm ET on August 2, 2023</em></small><br><br> Two years ago, an influential 2012 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1209746109">study</a> of dishonesty co-authored by the social psychologist and best-selling author Dan Ariely came under scrutiny. A group of scientists argued on their blog that some of the underlying data—describing the numbers of miles that a car-insurance company&#39;s customers reported having driven—had been faked, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://datacolada.org/98">beyond any shadow of a doubt</a> .” The academic <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/abs/10.1073/pnas.1209746109">paper</a> featuring that study, which described three separate experiments and had five co-authors in all, was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2115397118">retracted</a> not long after. At the time, Ariely said that the figures in question had been shared with him by the insurance company, and that he had no idea they might be wrong: “I can see why it is tempting to think that I had something to do with creating the data in a fraudulent way,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniemlee/dan-ariely-honesty-study-retraction">he told <em>BuzzFeed</em></a> , “but I didn&#39;t.”<br><br> Had the doctoring been done by someone from the insurer, as Ariely implied? There didn&#39;t seem to be a way to dispute that contention, and the company itself wasn&#39;t saying much. Then, last week, NPR&#39;s <em>Planet Money</em> delivered a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/27/1190568472/dan-ariely-francesca-gino-harvard-dishonesty-fabricated-data">scoop</a> : The company, called The Hartford, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apps.npr.org/documents/document.html?id=23888902-the-hartford-statement-to-nick-fountai">informed the show</a> that it had finally tracked down the raw numbers that were provided to Ariely—and that the data had been “manipulated inappropriately” in the published study. Reached by NPR, Ariely once again denied committing fraud. “Getting the data file was the extent of my involvement with the data,” he said.<br><br> That an expert on dishonesty would be accused of dishonesty was already notable. Paired with last month&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/24/business/economy/francesca-gino-harvard-dishonesty.html">allegations</a> that the Harvard Business School professor Francesca Gino—who also studies lying and is a frequent co-author of Ariely&#39;s—is associated with falsified data for <em>the</em> <em>very same</em> <em>2012 paper</em> , it&#39;s downright bizarre. The analysis of insurance data from The Hartford appeared as “Experiment 3” in the paper. On the preceding page, an analysis of a different dataset—the one linked to Gino—was written up as “Experiment 1.” The scientists who say they discovered issues with both experiments—Leif Nelson, Uri Simonsohn, and Joe Simmons—dubbed the apparent double fraud a “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://datacolada.org/109">clusterfake</a> .” When I spoke with the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/ivermectin-research-problems/620473/">scientific-misconduct investigator</a> and <em>Atlantic</em> contributor James Heathers, he had his own way of describing it: “This is some kind of mad, fraudulent unicorn.”<br><br> Given reports ( <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://joebakcoleman.com/blog/2023/Harvard/">contested</a> as they may be) that such an extraordinary beast exists, certain questions arise. For example, if the fraud is real, could this be a case of data-tampering in cahoots, or might it be nothing more than an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/francesca-gino-harvard-research-retraction/674630/">odd and ironic</a> coincidence? When I reached out to Ariely, he said he has never engaged in any research misconduct. “For more than 25 years and alongside dozens of esteemed colleagues and collaborators, I have conducted research that has resulted in more than 100 peer-reviewed papers,” he told me via email. “To be explicitly clear, I have never manipulated or misrepresented data in any of my work and have never knowingly participated in any project where the data or conclusions were manipulated or misrepresented.” Gino initially declined requests for comment. Since this article&#39;s publication, her attorneys have filed a $25 million lawsuit alleging defamation against Harvard University, Nelson, Simonsohn, and Simmons; and Gino posted a new <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/francescagino_i-want-to-be-very-clear-i-have-never-ever-activity-7092615706931789825-poii">statement</a> on LinkedIn. “I want to be very clear: I have never, ever falsified data or engaged in research misconduct of any kind,” it says.<br><br> If the mad, fraudulent unicorn is real—if two different scientists really did fabricate data for separate experiments that were published in the same paper—the scenario might well be unprecedented. Neither Heathers nor any other experts I spoke with could recall a single example of this kind. (Ivan Oransky, the editor in chief of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.spectrumnews.org/"><em>Spectrum</em></a> and a co-founder of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://retractionwatch.com/">Retraction Watch</a> , told me that he thinks it has happened in the past, but he couldn&#39;t recall anything specific.) If the 2012 paper on dishonesty does represent a case of coordinated misconduct, that would certainly be unnerving. But there&#39;s no evidence it does, and a coincidental, overlapping fraud would, in a way, be cause for even greater concern. It suggests that scientific fraud is <em>much</em> more common than the number of known cases might lead one to believe.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/francesca-gino-harvard-research-retraction/674630/">Read: The Harvard expert on dishonesty who is accused of lying</a><br><br> The actual rate of scientific fraud writ large is mysterious, but there are some clues. One laborious review of more than 20,000 biomedical research papers found that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4941872/">3.8 percent</a> contained images with “problematic” data, more than half of which showed signs of “deliberate manipulation.” And according to a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2685008/">meta-analysis</a> of 18 anonymous survey-studies conducted from 1985 to 2005, just under 2 percent of scientists admit to having fabricated, falsified, or modified data. That said, one can hardly expect <em>every</em> fraudster to self-identify as such, even anonymously. Why contribute to a result that could promote greater scrutiny of behavior like your own?<br><br> Further data on the problem are hard to come by, in large part because scientists rarely look for fraud in a systematic way, Heathers said. Nelson, one of the three psychologists who reported finding signs of tampering in the studies from the 2012 paper, told me that even delving into data from a single paper can be very time-intensive. His group, which investigates suspicious research for a blog called Data Colada, does this work not on behalf of any formal body, but rather as a sort of pro bono side hustle. (The Data Colada contributor Simonsohn co-authored a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797612459762">paper</a> with Gino in 2013.)<br><br> The lack of interest from scientific institutions in identifying fraud has both led to and been reinforced by some starry-eyed assumptions, said Nick Brown, a psychologist whose own investigations of suspect research have led to numerous <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/meet-data-thugs-out-expose-shoddy-and-questionable-research">corrections and retractions</a> . “There seems to be this idea that once you have a Ph.D., you are somehow a saint,” he told me. Then evidence of scientific misconduct emerges, and people act as though the unthinkable has happened.<br><br> A more skeptical posture has served Brown well in his own work as a data detective, as it has for the scientists behind Data Colada. When they set about reviewing Ariely&#39;s work on the 2012 paper, a few quirks in the car-insurance data tipped them off that something might be amiss. Some entries were in one font, some in another. Some were rounded to the nearest 500 or 1,000; some were not. But the detail that really caught their attention was the distribution of recorded values. With such a dataset, you&#39;d expect to see the numbers fall in a bell curve—most entries bunched up near the mean, and the rest dispersed along the tapering extremes. But the data that Ariely said he&#39;d gotten from the insurance company did not form a bell curve; the distribution was completely flat. Clients were just as likely to have claimed that they&#39;d driven 1,000 miles as 10,000 or 50,000 miles. It&#39;s “hard to know what the distribution of miles driven should look like in those data,” the scientists wrote. “It is not hard, however, to know what it should not look like.”<br><br> One can apply a sort of mirror-image reasoning to the possibility of a double fraud in the dishonesty paper. The numbers of miles driven didn&#39;t look the way the scientists assumed they should, so the scientists concluded that the data had been faked. Similarly, the number of fishy datasets in a single published paper doesn&#39;t really fit with expectations. But in the latter case, it would be our assumptions that are off. If fraud is really very rare—if, say, less than 2 percent of scientists ever committed it even once in their careers—then an overlap in 2012 would be an implausible anomaly. But imagine that scientific misbehavior is a good deal more common than is generally acknowledged: If that&#39;s the case, then “clusterfakes” might not be so unusual. Mad, fraudulent unicorns could be everywhere, just waiting to be found.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 15:39:48 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/gino-ariely-data-fraud-allegations/674891/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/gino-ariely-data-fraud-allegations/674891/</item><item><title><![CDATA[We’re Gambling With the Only Good Oceans in the Universe]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Earth&#39;s precious water made life possible.

One spot along the coastline hit triple-digit temperatures last month, conditions you would expect inside a hot tub. Some coastal Floridians skipped their usual dips in the ocean because it didn&#39;t seem appealing anymore.<br><br> Marine heat waves—periods of persistent and anomalously high temperatures of surface seawater—have materialized in other parts of the world too. The surface temperatures of about 44 percent of Earth&#39;s oceans are currently experiencing extreme heat, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psl.noaa.gov/marine-heatwaves/#report">according</a> to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Some of that warming is to be expected, because 2023 is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/what-is-la-nina-el-nino.html">an El Niño year</a> . But “all of these marine heat waves are made warmer because of climate change,” Dillon Amaya, a research scientist at NOAA&#39;s Physical Sciences Laboratory, told me. June was already a record-breaking month for the world&#39;s oceans, and then July came along and topped it. According to the experimental forecast system that Amaya and his colleagues run at NOAA, half of the world&#39;s oceans may be in the throes of a heat wave by September.<br><br> Earth is an ocean planet, a water world.

Of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/03/nasa-exoplanets-habitable-zone/627155/">more than 5,000 planets</a> they&#39;ve found, only a few are in the habitable zone—at the right distance from their star to be conducive to liquid, flowing water. And scientists have yet to confirm that any rocky, Earth-size planets are also wet. Part of the problem is that oceans are difficult to detect with the technology available to researchers today. Our planet may be slick with rolling seas, but “if we were to observe Earth as an exoplanet, from a different system, we could not measure that Earth has water,” Charles Cadieux, an astronomer at the University of Montreal, told me.<br><br> Other oceans exist in our very own solar system but are hidden beneath the surface of icy moons, their exact composition unknown to us. Krista Soderlund, a research scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, studies Europa, a moon of Jupiter with a salty subsurface ocean that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/10/jupiter-moon-europa-ocean-life-forms-nasa-clipper-mission/671671/">could harbor microbial life</a> ; she spends her days marveling at this other ocean world, all while worrying about the one she lives on. “I don&#39;t really have a way to reconcile that,” Soderlund told me. “You can see the short, rapid changes right now, and then I&#39;m looking forward to how that&#39;s going to affect my kids. How much worse is it going to be?”<br><br> Next year, NASA is scheduled to launch the mission that Soderlund is working on: a spacecraft that will reach Europa in 2030. The vessel will carry a plaque engraved with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://europa.nasa.gov/message-in-a-bottle/sign-on/">a poem</a> written by the US poet laureate, which reads in part, “O second moon, we, too, are made / of water, of vast and beckoning seas.” This idea of connection, a touch of intimacy in an unfamiliar cosmos, is lovely. Read another way, it sounds almost like an elegy. We <em>are</em> made of vast seas. But when those seas are superheated, dissolving <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whoi.edu/know-your-ocean/ocean-topics/climate-weather/ocean-warming/">the shells and skeletons</a> of marine creatures and enabling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://climateadapt.ucsd.edu/faq-californias-marine-heatwaves/">toxic blooms of algae</a> , they beg for relief more than they beckon.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2019/09/ipcc-sea-level-rise-report/598765/">Read: The oceans we know won&#39;t survive climate change</a><br><br> Our planet did not start out with seas.

First the former president posts something dyspeptic on Truth Social announcing that he&#39;s been informed by prosecutors that he&#39;ll be facing charges. Then everyone waits. After an excruciating delay, the indictment is revealed, accompanied by more angry Truth Social posts and a press conference by an unsmiling prosecutor standing in front of an American flag.<br><br> The first two indictments—in Manhattan, for Trump&#39;s role in coordinating hush-money payments in advance of the 2016 election, and in federal court in Florida, over the squirreling-away of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago—raised serious questions about Trump&#39;s abuses of authority and his willingness to cheat and deceive in order to acquire and hold on to power. But the third indictment cuts the deepest. Yesterday, Special Counsel Jack Smith<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/storage/US_v_Trump_23_cr_257.pdf">announced charges against Trump</a> for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and for his role in fueling the insurrection on January 6.<br><br> The indictment directly attacks the once and would-be future president&#39;s desperate campaign to stay in power after his 2020 loss. The claims Trump made about election fraud “were false, and the Defendant knew that they were false,” the government asserts. Trump has been charged with the evocatively titled crime of conspiracy against the United States. He also faces charges of obstructing an official proceeding—that is, Congress&#39;s counting of the electoral vote on January 6, which he attempted to disrupt with a riot he engineered—and a statute known as Section 241, a Reconstruction-era law that prohibits conspiring against the rights of another. The right in question, in this case, is that of the voters, whose ballots Trump sought to disregard in order to seize power for himself.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/08/trump-indictment-charges-overturn-2020-election/674887/">Tom Nichols: This is <em>the</em> case</a><br><br> The indictment tells a stark, damning story about what happened in the weeks and months after the 2020 election and in the run-up to January 6. Trump and a selection of unnamed co-conspirators tried to persuade state officials to ignore the popular vote in their states to favor Trump over Joe Biden; when that didn&#39;t work, they coordinated slates of “fake electors” to sow doubt over Biden&#39;s Electoral College victory; when that didn&#39;t work, they tried to strong-arm the Justice Department into pressuring state legislators to back Trump&#39;s claims; when that didn&#39;t work, they worked to persuade Vice President Mike Pence to abuse his role presiding over the counting of the electoral vote and upend the process. And when Pence refused, Trump turned to violence—encouraging an angry crowd to march on the Capitol to threaten the vice president into submission.<br><br> Set out in grainy black and white, stamped with the markings of the federal court system, the special counsel&#39;s account of those events is a splash of cold water. This really did happen, no matter how much Trump and his allies have tried to deny it. Part of what&#39;s striking, though, is how familiar the story seems. A hefty portion of the indictment—though not all of it—draws from the narrative set out by the House select committee on the January 6 attack, which wrapped up its work in January 2023 after a string of blockbuster hearings and the release of a mammoth 800-page report. In that sense, the indictment is an extraordinary endorsement of the committee&#39;s work.<br><br> The broad strokes of what happened from November 2020 to January 2021 were, of course, apparent in the moment to anyone reading the news. Trump whipped up the riot in real time and then tweeted his approval as it was ongoing. But the January 6 committee <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/january-6-hearings-final-change-mind/671731/">was able to unearth evidence</a> of Trump&#39;s close involvement with the development of the various schemes set in motion by his supporters—along with a mountain of testimony about the many, many, many times the president was informed that his claims of fraud had no merit, that he had clearly lost the election, and that the legal arguments he was relying on to claim otherwise weren&#39;t worth the paper they were written on. These discoveries guide the indictment&#39;s narrative, and they&#39;re key to the argument Smith is setting out about Trump&#39;s legal culpability.<br><br> Some of the indictment&#39;s most striking quotes made their first appearance in testimony by witnesses before the committee. “We don&#39;t have the evidence, but we have lots of theories” about election fraud, the document quotes an unnamed “Co-Conspirator 1” telling Rusty Bowers, the speaker of the Arizona house. Bowers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/21/1106413341/arizona-lawmaker-rusty-bowers-pressure-giuliani">told the committee in a public hearing</a> that those words were spoken to him by Trump&#39;s lawyer Rudy Giuliani.<br><br> This isn&#39;t to say that the indictment is a dull rerun. There&#39;s new information to be found—for example, that Pence was keeping contemporaneous notes of his conversations with Trump during those harrowing last months. One campaign adviser complained in a freshly unearthed December 2020 email that “it&#39;s tough to own any of this when it&#39;s just conspiracy shit beamed down from the mothership.” In a particularly chilling new detail, Smith recounts a conversation between “Co-Conspirator 4”—seemingly the Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, who unsuccessfully pushed for the department to back Trump&#39;s claims of voter fraud—and a White House lawyer who objected to Clark&#39;s plan to keep Trump in power. The lawyer reportedly told Clark that such a scheme would result in “riots in every major city in the United States.” Clark, referencing a controversial reading of the president&#39;s authority to send in the military to quell civilian unrest, responded, “That&#39;s why there&#39;s an Insurrection Act.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">David A.

(It&#39;s a group of which I am a member: class of &#39;89, Leningrad to Texas.) Rarely have I received so many responses from sources so quickly.<br><br> One day, Olga B.&#39;s mom came over and replaced her silverware with silverware that she (the mom) thought was “better.” Anna Z. gave her parents a key to her house for emergencies only, but one day, she turned around in her backyard and saw her mom waving hello at her from her own bedroom window. (She and others asked to go by their first name and an initial in order to speak freely about private family matters that, if you ask their parents, should never be shared with strangers.)<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/11/people-oversharing-tmi-friendship-boundaries/671970/">Read: The decline of etiquette and the rise of &#39;boundaries&#39;</a><br><br> Veronica M. told me her father believes that “boundaries are Stalinist.” Nevertheless, she compared boundary setting to the Dutch children&#39;s tale about a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dutchgenealogy.nl/why-the-little-dutch-boy-never-put-his-finger-in-the-dike/#:~:text=The%20Little%20Dutch%20boy%20who,his%20finger%20in%20the%20dike.">boy</a> who sticks his finger in a dam to prevent a flood: “It would be even worse if I didn&#39;t try to protect my boundaries.”<br><br> I assume that immigrants of other nationalities are similarly bewildered by boundaries; it&#39;s just that the former USSR sits in the razor-thin Venn-diagram slice of cultures that are both collectivistic and in-your-face. Russian famously <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4371#:~:text=Maybe%20number%207%2C%20the%20borrowed,the%20culture%20to%20be%20expressed.">has no word</a> for “privacy,” the concept at the core of most boundaries. To explain their parents&#39; boundary trampling, my interviewees had precise psychoanalyses: Our Soviet parents, they&#39;ll remind you, came here with nothing, and then raised their kids in the wild capitalism of suburbia. American schools subjected their children to countless anti-drug and anti-sex workshops about the importance of personal space and autonomy. Still, our folks clung to the hope that as adults we&#39;d behave as though we lived in a stacked <em>kommunalka</em> , deferring to our parents right down the hall. They want us to be better than them but also to be exactly like them. “My parents&#39; idea,” Veronica says, is “if you loved me, you would do what I say so that I don&#39;t worry.” If Russian parents got a tattoo—which they would never—it would say precisely this.<br><br> Former-Soviet parents struggle with boundaries for magnified versions of the reasons everyone struggles with them: They&#39;re an unfamiliar concept, and we all think we know better ways of handling conflict. <em>Whatever happened to good old-fashioned shouting?</em> We don&#39;t like it when boundaries are imposed on us. We don&#39;t like having to impose them. We don&#39;t even totally know how to do it. (Although, through plenty of practice, my Russian American interviewees seem to have figured it out.)<br><br> And yet, boundaries seem to, well, abound. Although the exact definition of <em>boundaries</em> seems to vary widely, they are best understood as a set of internal rules that determine what you&#39;re willing to tolerate from other people. Instagram therapy accounts and various <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2022/nov/06/how-to-set-boundaries-and-stop-letting-anxiety-and-guily-get-in-the-way-of-life">websites</a> offer guides to setting boundaries, and gentle-parenting TikTok brims with videos about “holding firm boundaries” with your kids while somehow also never telling them no. In 2022, the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Book-Boundaries-Limits-That-Will-ebook/dp/B09W498593/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2EV3PJN58FTQW&amp;keywords=big+book+of+boundaries&amp;qid=1689960060&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=big+book+of+boundaries%2Cstripbooks%2C69&amp;sr=1-1">best-selling <em>Book of Boundaries</em></a> assured us that boundaries “will set you free,” and in 2023, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Drama-Free-Managing-Unhealthy-Relationships/dp/0593539273/ref=pd_lpo_sccl_2/136-6471660-1239655?pd_rd_w=9DpOp&amp;content-id=amzn1.sym.116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&amp;pf_rd_p=116f529c-aa4d-4763-b2b6-4d614ec7dc00&amp;pf_rd_r=FAVD9Y0FTPS4Y92WWE91&amp;pd_rd_wg=plkuL&amp;pd_rd_r=699dd09f-4a3d-42aa-8776-a8da5e8a2a4e&amp;pd_rd_i=0593539273&amp;psc=1">another best seller</a> , <em>Drama Free</em> , explained how to set boundaries with difficult people. Many people learn about boundaries in therapy, and the number of people in therapy is on the rise—nearly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/09/20/opinion/therapy-america-covid.html">one in four adults under 45</a> has sought mental-health treatment in the past year. One therapist speculated to me that perhaps people are talking about boundaries more because Donald Trump has made politics so polarized and sensitive. Why <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/2016/11/23/13708996/argue-better-science">learn to argue</a> better with your conservative uncle when you can simply tell him, “I don&#39;t have the capacity for this conversation right now”? If hell is other people, boundaries seem like a rope ladder back to purgatory.<br><br> Yet even as “boundaries” have taken off, the concept has become misunderstood, joining <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/01/10/misuse-gaslighting-trauma-narcissism/"><em>gaslit</em> and <em>narcissist</em></a> in the pantheon of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-rise-of-therapy-speak">misused psychology jargon</a> . When you want someone to do something, throwing in the word <em>boundary</em> can lend the request a patina of therapeutic legitimacy. The most public recent example was the texts shared by the surfer Sarah Brady from her ex-boyfriend Jonah Hill, in which the actor appeared to claim that some of his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/stephaniesoteriou/jonah-hill-ex-sarah-brady-more-alleged-text-screenshots">“boundaries”</a> were that Brady not surf with men or post pictures of herself in a bathing suit. “I think people get dribs and drabs of therapeutic concepts or lingo, and then they swing them around like arrows,” Karen Osterle, a therapist in Washington, DC, told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/04/are-you-using-gaslight-correctly/629522/">Read: Are you using <em>gaslight</em> correctly?</a><br><br> When imposed on us, boundaries can feel upsetting. Because many people view happy relationships as problem free, a request to behave differently can feel like a rejection. Some people—out of trauma or other wounds—interpret a “no” from a loved one as the end of a relationship. But boundaries are supposed to help preserve relationships, not destroy them. “People typically believe that boundaries are to control people, and in actuality, they are safeguards for yourself and for peace and comfort in your relationships,” says the therapist and <em>Drama Free</em> author Nedra Glover Tawwab.<br><br> In fact, having well-kept boundaries can be a sign of an especially <em>healthy</em> relationship. Most of the former-Soviet immigrants I interviewed said that their relationship with their parents improved after they started enforcing boundaries, even if the parents didn&#39;t much like the boundaries themselves.<br><br> When Anna Z. was 25, she still lived with her parents. One day, she left her phone at home to go train with a parkour instructor, and her mother was briefly unable to reach her. Her mother dug through Anna&#39;s phone bill, found the instructor&#39;s number, and called him herself. When Anna confronted her, her mother justified her actions by saying that she still paid Anna&#39;s phone bill. Anna said that she&#39;d told her mother many times to be more respectful of her privacy, so this time she took action: She put the phone on the table and left the house for a few hours. To Anna&#39;s shock, when she returned, her mother apologized. “If you can set boundaries with people, and they respect it—maybe those are good people to keep around,” says Alex Ly, a therapist in the Bay Area.<br><br> But, more important, we frequently misunderstand what it means to be the boundary <em>setter</em> . Boundaries are often thought of as rules for other people, but in reality, they&#39;re rules for ourselves. They&#39;re our own definition of what we&#39;re comfortable with, and our own choice about what we&#39;ll do if someone ignores the boundary. A boundary means “you are responsible for what&#39;s in your yard, which would be your thoughts, your feelings, and your actions, your opinions,” says Dana Skaggs, a therapist in Tennessee. “And your neighbors also have a right to their thoughts, their feelings, their opinions, and their actions.” Other people have their own yard, and you can&#39;t determine what&#39;s planted there. This can also mean you&#39;re not going to try to “rescue” people from their beliefs or make them behave a certain way.<br><br> This is an important distinction, because the true test of a boundary is how you&#39;ll respond when people do things you don&#39;t want them to do. “There&#39;s no boundary without internal consequence,” says Laura Vladimirova, a therapist in Brooklyn who is from Ukraine. “Let&#39;s say you&#39;re my sister, and I say to you, &#39;Hey, I don&#39;t want you coming over unannounced anymore.&#39; Then my suspicion—and this as an incorrect suspicion—is that you&#39;re going to listen to me and stop coming over unannounced.”<br><br> But your sister—and other people—may not agree to your boundary. At that point, you have to decide what you&#39;ll do. When your sister swings by without warning, will you let her in? Ask her to come back later? Distance yourself for a while? In a way, Jonah Hill&#39;s texts <em>are</em> a good example of boundaries—he&#39;s saying he&#39;s not going to stay in the relationship if his (strange, unreasonable) requests aren&#39;t met. One may wonder why he would enter a relationship with a semi-professional surfer if he is triggered by swimsuit photos, but hey, a boundary&#39;s a boundary.<br><br> This same logic applies to setting boundaries with children. Parents may think that a boundary is a rule for their child to follow—for example, “You have to put your shoes on before you go outside.” But in reality, what matters is what the parent will do when the child tests the boundary. (Probably put the shoes on themselves while being assailed with tiny kicks.)<br><br> The final incorrect assumption that people often make about boundaries: that a boundary violator should be automatically and permanently ejected from your life. “Sometimes, with boundaries, we think the most severe consequence is what&#39;s always needed,” Tawwab told me. But if we ended relationships every time our boundaries were violated, “we would not have any relationships.” The first time someone violates your boundary, in fact, you might just remind them about your boundary. The next time, you might decide to go a week without talking, for example. Only in extreme cases should you cut off all contact.<br><br> Not even professionals, in fact, can make everyone obey their boundaries. Vladimirova, the therapist, told me that she doesn&#39;t like it when her mom asks her how things are going with her partner. “No matter how many times I ask for that to remain personal, it somehow winds its way back into conversation every six months or so,” she said.<br><br> And what does she do about it? “It&#39;s a fantastic cycle of me blowing up and then not talking to my parent,” she said, “then having a nice, superficial conversation about other things again.”<br><br> Your mother&#39;s just worried about you, that&#39;s all.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 02 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/boundaries-psychology-therapy-mental-health/674882/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/boundaries-psychology-therapy-mental-health/674882/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Queasy Liberal Schadenfreude of Watching Trump Wreck DeSantis]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The pleasure is tainted, because the likely result is Trump as the Republican nominee—with a real chance of becoming president again. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/nXgi9Mf-jg221bKPGDzfxQC1xuc=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/ron_desantis/original.jpg" alt="罗恩·德桑蒂斯在讲台上俯视的照片" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Jamie Kelter Davis / The New York Times / Redux</figcaption></figure> America loves an underdog, but perhaps not as much as it loves to watch a tumbling Icarus. No one&#39;s wings have melted more dramatically and publicly over the past few months than Ron DeSantis&#39;s. Eight months ago, the Florida governor was the man who would finally finish Donald Trump. Today he&#39;s scraping to keep ahead of Vivek Ramaswamy, whom hardly anyone had heard of until recently.<br><br> Nearly every day, DeSantis seems to have some new problem. A <i>New York Times</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/31/us/elections/times-siena-poll-republican-primary-crosstabs.html">poll</a> published on Monday shows Trump with a commanding lead over DeSantis, and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/upshot/poll-trump-republican-primary.html">specific breakdown of voter attitudes and profiles</a> shows why it will be so hard for DeSantis to close that gap. DeSantis is in the midst of what is described as a campaign reboot but looks mostly like a mass firing, with the same old talking points and approaches—and, most important, the same old candidate. Trump has happily exploited DeSantis&#39;s weaknesses, saying he has “no personality” and boasting in June, “Since Ron DeSanctimonious announced his candidacy, he has wasted over $15 million just so he can drop into nearly single digits.”<br><br> For anyone on the left side of American politics, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-features/trump-desantis-2024primary-personal-attacks-1234765006/">this has</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/28/opinion/ron-desantis-trump-campaign.html">provided</a> a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/supposed-desantis-moment-instead-trump-221401609.html">queasy</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/04/ron-desantis-trump-republican-nomination-losing-smart.html">schadenfreude</a> . DeSantis&#39;s exceptionally effective implementation of hard-right policies in Florida and his overt antagonism toward the media had made him seem like a figure of unusual promise and danger. Seeing Trump run circles around DeSantis with an ease not on display since the 2016 GOP primary has been entertaining to watch, but it&#39;s a tainted pleasure, because the likely result is Trump as the Republican nominee—with a real chance of becoming president again.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ron-desantis-cnn-interview/674751/">Helen Lewis: The humiliation of Ron DeSantis</a><br><br> A few months ago, a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/who-should-democrats-support-ron-desantis-donald-trump-republican-primary.html">lively debate</a> took place in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-03-13/trump-desantis-republican-primary-2024-election">certain</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/27/opinion/desantis-trump-president-comparison.html">precincts</a> over who would be worse for American democracy, President DeSantis or a reprise of President Trump. On the one hand, Trump has no respect for democratic institutions or rule of law and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">already attempted an <i>autogolpe</i></a> ; on the other, his administration was characterized by frequent buffoonery and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/06/hollow-law-and-order-presidency/612535/">failure to execute</a> . DeSantis, for his part, looked somewhat more like a normal conservative Republican, but his selling point was that unlike Trump, he actually knew how to get results, as his Florida résumé demonstrated—meaning he might be better at putting extreme policies into place. That debate faded a bit as DeSantis moved hard right, signing a very strict abortion law and escalating his feud with Disney, but mostly it has faded as DeSantis seems less and less likely to defeat Trump.<br><br> DeSantis&#39;s collapse has happened in part because he may just <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/HenryJGomez/status/1686155734000541696?s=20">not be a very good politician</a> . The hard-right turn and falling polls are not unrelated; he&#39;s pursuing ideas <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/benjysarlin/status/1686002686842286080?s=61&amp;t=Ab4JqnFuof5dzAT3TeQ3eA">that most Republicans don&#39;t support</a> , much less most voters. The more voters see of him, the less they want to elect him. In a famous formulation, Americans want leaders with whom they can imagine drinking a beer. DeSantis comes across as the kind of guy who would <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://boingboing.net/2023/07/28/ron-desantis-scolds-a-kid-for-eating-an-icy-treat-on-a-hot-day-thats-a-lot-of-sugar-huh-video.html">lecture you about the empty calories in your glass</a> , glower while he hurriedly gulped some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/21/desantis-orders-probe-into-bud-light-dylan-mulvaney-deal.html">non–AB InBev product</a> , and then depart abruptly, leaving a bad tip. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.natesilver.net/p/ron-desantiss-electoral-track-record?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2">As Nate Silver recently pointed out</a> , DeSantis&#39;s electoral record isn&#39;t great. His 2022 performance was impressive, but in his other four races, he&#39;s run behind a generic Republican. Trump likes to say that he made DeSantis&#39;s career with his endorsement in the 2018 Florida governor&#39;s race, and he might have a point.<br><br> Which leads to the other big factor in DeSantis&#39;s poor showing: Trump has been very good at beating him up. In 2018, 2020, and 2022, Trump led the Republican Party to defeat, so not since 2016 have we seen Trump demonstrating his full ability to shred an opponent. There&#39;s something satisfying about watching an artist at work, even when that work is petty bullying of political rivals. Although he upset Hillary Clinton in the 2016 general election, he&#39;s always been best at taking down fellow Republicans, so perhaps it&#39;s no surprise that he&#39;s so good at undermining DeSantis.<br><br> DeSantis (and other GOP candidates) is rightly afraid to attack Trump at the risk of alienating his base, but can&#39;t afford not to attack him in order to draw a distinction. Either way, he can&#39;t win. When DeSantis has echoed Trump, the former president has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://djt.nucleusemail.com/amplify/v/6J75XS5yra?hids=KQQHVbn&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=230531-icymi_ron_desantis_blatantly_plagiarizes_president_trumps_great_american_comeback&amp;utm_content=ncl-arH5DzuRFM&amp;_nlid=arH5DzuRFM&amp;_nhids=KQQHVbn">mocked</a> him as a cheap <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://djt.nucleusemail.com/amplify/v/jZ72VpFvYK?hids=7mJF3W2&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=230525-ron_desantis_blatantly_plagiarizes_president_trumps_great_american_comeback&amp;utm_content=ncl-Ex6SEUwjKe&amp;_nlid=Ex6SEUwjKe&amp;_nhids=7mJF3W2">knockoff</a> . When DeSantis has (cautiously) criticized him, Trump has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://djt.nucleusemail.com/amplify/v/93wjMbXRmb?hids=nPoCrx2&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=230601-icymi_ron_desantis_praised_anthony_fauci_for_covid_response_in_spring_2020_for_really_doing_a_good_job&amp;utm_content=ncl-3GcUfp2gTs&amp;_nlid=3GcUfp2gTs&amp;_nhids=nPoCrx2">quoted</a> DeSantis&#39;s past <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://djt.nucleusemail.com/amplify/v/wjRhQ9YMuF?hids=Y9Nh54w&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=230526-ron_desantis_voted_for_the_exact_daca_bill_over_which_he_is_now_attacking_president_trump&amp;utm_content=ncl-cWmGsmVQdP&amp;_nlid=cWmGsmVQdP&amp;_nhids=Y9Nh54w">agreement</a> . When DeSantis has tried to outflank Trump to the right, Trump has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/18/politics/desantis-trump-issues/index.html">mostly stood to the side and watched</a> . (That&#39;s a good reminder that although Trump governed as an aspiring authoritarian, the Republican field was to the right of him on many issues in 2016.) Trump has reveled in racking up endorsements from officeholders—and especially in snatching those of most Florida Republicans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-racks-up-florida-endorsements-blow-desantis-2023-04-19/">from right under DeSantis&#39;s nose</a> .<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/ron-desantis-awkward-trump-2024/672292/">Mark Leibovich: Just wait until you get to know Ron DeSantis</a><br><br> None of the liberal glee at watching Trump skewer DeSantis reflects newfound affection for the former president. There&#39;s no Republican candidate whom Democrats would actually <i>like</i> (you can bet that the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/chris-christies-only-constituents-are-liberal-pundits/674437/">progressive crush on Chris Christie</a> would evaporate quickly if he were out talking about his policy ideas rather than attacking Trump). But many people in both parties believe that Trump would be the weakest possible Republican candidate in 2024—and that leaves many Democrats in the strange position of rooting for Trump in the primary.<br><br> Trump may not be as weak as his detractors imagine, or, at the very least, DeSantis may be no stronger. DeSantis&#39;s wooden personality, very conservative platform, and pathetic performance thus far are enough to make one wonder whether he&#39;d make Michael Dukakis look like a strong general-election candidate. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/america-has-anti-maga-majority/672047/">Even if Trump is a weak candidate</a> , the general election will likely be decided by a very few percentage points and perhaps just tens of thousands of votes in key states. Given the vagaries of the economy, President Joe Biden&#39;s age and tendency toward gaffes, and the randomness of any election, Trump could very well win, inaugurating a disastrous second presidency. Liberals can&#39;t in good faith pull for either man in the primary.

（我们这些在媒体上持有相同观点的人有特殊的责任停止讨论特朗普，就好像他是一个正常的候选人，甚至是一个正常的人一样，尤其是在今天的起诉之后。）我长期以来一直将特朗普的候选资格描述为道德选择和考验公民品格，但我<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/peacefield/619b32150b037b002073403e/the-no-drama-thanksgiving/">也提醒</a>美国人，为了社会礼让，他们之间应该抵制太多关于政治的争论。我无法再为这个建议辩护。<br><br>今天公布的起诉书向每一位美国人提出挑战，要求他们以一切可能的和平、合法和文明的方式捍卫我们的共和国。根据指控，特朗普不仅试图推翻选举，而且还试图推翻选举。他带领一群同谋，意图镇压对特朗普继续武力统治的任何进一步挑战。根据起诉书：<br><br><p>白宫副律师向同谋4重申，选举中不存在决定结果的欺诈行为，如果被告[特朗普]继续留任，“美国每个主要城市都会发生骚乱”。

《叛乱法》允许总统部署美国武装部队来对付美国公民。所谓的白宫内部阴谋不仅是为了使选举无效，也是为了让选举无效。它包括释放美国军队对付本国人民的可能性。<br><br>这就是为什么当一个烦人的叔叔对被盗的选举大肆宣扬时，我们不能再只是翻白眼。我们不应该温和地询问父母是否可以在晚餐时更换福克斯的频道。当一位老朋友谈论“示威者”或亨特·拜登生殖器对国家安全的可怕影响时，我们没有义务小心翼翼地改变话题。这一切已经够了；我们可以爱我们的朋友、家人和邻居<a

Tillotson) 日常通话的片段，她经常将通话设置为免提模式。但她认为他和她以前约会过的男人一样，并没有完全理解他们友谊的本质。韦斯特向他解释说：“我需要你知道她不会去任何地方。她是我的No.1。”蒂洛森在他之前就在那里，韦斯特告诉他，“她会在你之后在那里。如果你在任何时候认为这不会成为我的第一，那你就错了。”</p><p>如果韦斯特的言论听起来很直率，那是因为她决心不再重蹈20多岁的痛苦经历。当时她的男朋友已经意识到他不是她的首要任务。韦斯特认为这是试图让她远离她的朋友，他贬低了蒂洛森，称她为荡妇和不良影响。这段关系结束后，31 岁的韦斯特发誓永远不会让另一个男人破坏她的友谊。她决定任何未来的浪漫伴侣都必须适应她与蒂洛森的友谊，而不是相反。</p> <a data-event-element="inline link"

年来一直喜欢做的事情。上周，我作为教授或讲师在任何地方进行了最后一次演讲，结束了超过 35 年的教学生涯。<br><br>我热爱教学，但暑期学校始终是我最喜欢的活动之一，因为我知道作为老师和学生的感觉。 1978 年，我通过谈话进入了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://summer.harvard.edu/">哈佛暑期学校</a>的高中生项目——尽管我不是一个非常优秀的高中生——在那里我摸索着学习微积分。 （我通过了。勉强通过。）但我第一次尝到了大学的滋味，我终于看到了高中隧道尽头的曙光。<br><br>夏天的学习看起来几乎不自然，教学也是如此。 （我在美国海军战争学院任教了二十多年，该学院在八月开始上课，我一直非常讨厌它。）然而，校园里的暑期学校却有一种温和的态度，这让它看起来像是一个自然的组成部分。美好的夏天——尤其是如果你还年轻的话。当我回到哈佛暑期学校担任讲师时，我的本科生中有高中生，甚至还有高年级研究生。他们中的许多人都很害怕，但我总是确保告诉他们我曾经坐在他们坐过的地方（一次，实际上是在同一个教室），不用担心。我坚持要他们利用波士顿灿烂的夏天。我看着他们中的一些人离开，心里带着一丝恐惧，就像 45 年前那个夏天我回到家时一样。<br><br>我也该走了。我现在已经在课堂上竭尽全力了。但我会想念闷热的日子里喧闹的校园和教室的清凉安静。我比任何人都更想念所有年龄段的学生，尤其是那些离开时脸上带着一丝惊奇和兴奋的学生，有一天他们会回到校园。<br><br> — 汤姆<br><br><i>Katherine Hu contributed to this
