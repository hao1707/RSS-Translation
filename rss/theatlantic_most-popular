href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/us-womens-national-team-soccer-world-cup/674885/">他们正在挣扎</a>。周二，他们在总体表现不佳的情况下勉强与排名第九的葡萄牙队打平，周日他们将面对排名第三的瑞典队的一场充满挑战的比赛。对于粉丝来说，这是令人心碎的事情。在过去的二十年里，该队培养出了才华横溢的球员，在争取同工同酬的斗争中取得了胜利，并为女孩成为成功的运动员展示了可行的模式。反对他们是很吝啬的，但现在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/us-womens-national-team-soccer-world-cup/674885/">可能是时候了</a>。<br><br>尽管美国一直在支持女子足球联赛，但世界各地的球队都在关注这一点。英国球队已经开始投资女队，尽管对一些人来说，她们可能被视为男队的二流球队。全球各地的女队都在品尝粉丝和合法性的滋味，在这种势头的基础上，也许世界已经准备好迎接一个令人惊讶的获胜者。统治中没有戏剧性。女足要想真正轰动全球，美国需要有实力的对手。<br><br>在本集中，我们向托宾·希思 (Tobin Heath) 和克里斯汀·普雷斯 (Christen Press) 提出了这个理论，尽管它很尴尬，他们主持了 YouTube 系列节目<em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9qGpfsW-OA">《The RE-CAP Show》</a></em> 。她们都曾为国外职业球队和美国国家女子足球联盟效力。他们都是最近两届世界杯冠军球队的成员。毫不奇怪，他们不同意这个前提。<br><br> “不不不。我明白你想在那里做什么，”希思说。 “但是，不，绝对不。我仍然认为美国女足国家队不仅是增加女足投资的斗争的火炬手，也是全球薪酬公平的火炬手。我认为美国女子国家队的成功是这项运动全球第一的推动者。”<br><br>请听这里的对话：

href="https://pca.st/ccxU">袖珍铸件</a></em><br><br><strong><em>以下为采访实录：</em></strong><br><br><strong>汉娜·罗辛：</strong>克里斯汀，我一直在关注的一个动态是：在早些时候，美国女子国家队的大多数球员都来自一小部分大学球队。现在有更多的人来自职业女子团队。我想知道这如何改变动态。<br><br><strong>克里斯汀·普雷斯：</strong>是的，这真的很有趣。我认为我们正处于一个变化很快的环境中。我记得当第一批球员决定提前离开大学，或者不上大学时，我们这一代球员对此感到震惊和恐惧。因为我们对联盟的稳定性还没有信心。<br><br>现在这很常见，我认为这说明了我们在联赛层面取得了多大的进步。 NWSL（全国女子足球联盟）正在努力制定职业标准，让球员能够为国家队效力。<br><br>第九条以及大学课程的优势对于美国女子国家队的成功发挥了重要作用。随着这种情况的发展，我们的联盟确实有责任继续帮助球员发展并找到他们在国际水平上获胜所需的素质。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>你们是很酷、很独特的人。因为你正在经历这段活生生的历史。美国女足的变化如此之快。世界各地的女子足球变化如此之快。你正在观看它的建造过程。<br><br><strong>托宾·希思：</strong>是的，我喜欢这个。活生生的历史。这是真的。我总是说，我们在构建梦想的同时也在实现它。因为我们在职业生涯中取得的很多成就，当我们刚开始打球时，这些东西对我们来说甚至还不存在。<br><br>正如克里斯汀现在提到的，NWSL 已进入第 11 或第 12 年，这是惊人的。过去两个联赛都失败了。还没有超过五年。因此，即使看看这一进展，它也确实是独一无二的。每届世界杯，女足以及全球女子体育的格局都会发生巨大变化。<br><br>所以我们总是好奇会发生什么。我认为世界杯冠军也确实决定了这一点。 2015 年至 2019 年间，我们目睹了形势的巨大变化。你们刚才分享的机会就是来自这些机会。这是了解下一个转变是什么样子的独特时机。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>等等，你们真的认为什么事情都有可能发生吗？因为很有趣，现在的每一篇文章都是关于美国队将如何进行一场艰苦的战斗来赢得连续第三个冠军，因为其他球队正在迎头赶上。我不知道这是否只是让整件事变得有趣的原因。<br><br><strong>记者：</strong>哦，他们说每届世界杯。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>每届世界杯，如果你回顾每届世界杯的任何头条新闻。<br><br><strong>记者：</strong>但这也是事实。两者是同时进行的。我记得我的第一届世界杯。美国已经很久没有赢了，他们还在用这样的说辞：<em>哦，世界正在迎头赶上。</em><em>获胜将比以往任何时候都更加困难。</em><br><br>你知道，现在随着联赛在多个大洲取得成功，世界在投资方面正在迎头赶上。我认为随着奖金的不断增加，只会鼓励联合会继续投资，这将使锦标赛变得更好。<br><br>从我第一次参加世界杯到现在，我的最终感受是：太棒了，你想击败最好的球队。你希望每个人都处于最佳状态。我们并不是想赢得这届世界杯，因为我们是投入最多的球队。我们希望每个人都能投资。我们想赢得世界杯。<br><br>当你谈论三连冠时，这是一个非常有趣的现象，因为它与掷硬币时的情况是一样的。每次掷硬币时，赔率都会重置。但从情感上来说，对我来说，球队能够取得三连胜是不可思议的。<br><br>因为每一届世界杯，我都会说，<em>我们几乎不可能获胜。</em>它是如此艰苦。你必须完美。你必须有足够的运气在你身边。你必须有如此多的优秀。这几乎是不可能的。然后我们就会赢，我会说，<em>天哪。</em>比如说，那是深不可测的。因此，想象一下连续三次这样做，真是令人难以承受。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>哦，你知道，现在有一个可怕的大问题。鉴于你刚才所说的一切，也许这更好——我什至可以这么说吗？——我的意思是，我知道你们支持美国，我也支持美国，但也许对美国来说，这对全球女子足球更好，而不是赢？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>不，不，不，我明白你想做什么。但是，不，绝对不。我仍然认为美国女足国家队不仅是增加女足投资的斗争的火炬手，也是全球薪酬公平的火炬手。我认为美国女子国家队的成功是我们这项运动在全球范围内获得应有认可和投资的第一推动力。<br><br>我认为我们仍然是团队，下面的，那就是最伟大的。我认为我们仍然对这项运动的格局影响最大。所以我认为，尽管我们有时想为其他国家加油，但我认为对这项运动来说最好的事情实际上是美国女子国家队再次获胜。<br><br>我认为很多机会都来​​自于此，因为我们是谁以及我们代表什么。但是，正如克里斯汀所说，三连冠是疯狂的。不这样做会更具破坏性，因为那样你就会回到零，对吗？<br><br>就像很多年的历史一样，已经过去了。我不想让它重置。但是，是的，我们会看看会发生什么。我的意思是，每个人都说任何人都可以获胜。我认为，最终输球的是美国女足国家队。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>尽管如此，请纵容我一下，因为你们在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://re-website.com/pages/recapshow">节目</a>中进行辩论；再给我一轮辩论。如果是另一支球队获胜呢？令人惊讶的团队？<br><br>那就太令人兴奋了。然后女子运动就会在世界各地扎根，到处都会有很多人观看。然后，即使是美国运动员也会有很多地方可以去，这只会建立整个全球运动。克里斯汀，你觉得怎么样？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>我认为问题是你需要一些基础设施来实现变革，对吧？因此，英格兰就是一个很好的例子。因为英格兰联赛表现非常好，他们有机会迅速进入大型体育场，利用英格兰国家队在欧洲杯上取得的成功。<br><br>所以，当你问这个问题时，我的想法和托宾完全一样。由于我们对基础设施的投资，我们能够从胜利中获得最大收益。显然，作为美国人，我们也倾向于认为我们的新闻是全球新闻。但我认为球队的历史就是为变革而奋斗。这在美国女子国家队的文化中根深蒂固。我确实认为这种情况具有传染性，而且一直以来都具有传染性，其他国家也受到了我们一直在进行并取得胜利的斗争的鼓舞。<br><br>在某些时候，我们希望如此。我们在我们国家看到的变化，我们希望它能够迅速涌入所有国家。但我确实认为，实际上，我们处于继续产生最大影响的最佳位置。这只是因为有多少人报道它，有多少人在我们国家观看比赛，我们的联赛在哪里，我们必须在哪些体育场出售门票和商品——所有这些。<br><br>因为最终推动业务发展的是金钱，对吗？这就是美国能够实现变革并产生影响的原因——基础设施及其业务推动一切向前发展。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>是的。我想补充一点，我认为实际上可能发生的最糟糕的事情是，如果美国女足国家队输了，而英格兰队赢了。就基础设施而言。在克里斯汀看来，因为他们拥有扩大成功的基础设施。<br><br>我们已经在欧元上看到了这一点。他们仅仅从那场比赛中就取得了巨大的规模。凭借世界杯的规模，我认为这将真正彻底改变欧洲足球。我认为这将是一个真正的竞争优势，因为如果他们获胜，他们就代表了整个欧洲。如果我们赢了，我们就代表了我们和我们的统治地位。这完全是另一个等式。如果我们有这个播客的第 2 部分，您可以在那里观看。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>等等，但是托宾，你是说如果英国队赢了也一样好吗？因为他们有完全不同的模型。我知道你对这种模式有一些经验，他们隶属于这些传奇的男子俱乐部，比如曼联和阿森纳。我也想知道这样做的优点和缺点。这是促进和发展女子足球的神奇方式吗？还是这让他们处于男足的阴影之下？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>这是一个完全不同的模型。我更关心的是它是否具有很强的竞争力，但又是一种不同的竞争。我坚信女性团队的独立所有权。我们已经看到了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-soccer/674802/">天使之城的</a>成功。我坚信，如果你和男队在同一把伞下，你本质上永远是第二名。这真的很难进化出来。<br><br>在美国，对于女性来说，我们是第一运动。我们国家的男子足球可能排名第五？所以我认为独立对我们更有利，因为我认为我们国家的女性运动是第一，那么你为什么要模仿我们国家的第五运动呢？<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>但在英国，我认为情况完全相反。事实上，我认为他们在男子球队的保护下有很多好处，因为结构，因为球迷基础，因为足球在那个国家的意义的历史。我认为，如果他们要赢得世界杯，那将是可怕的，他们在这些庞大的建筑中可能拥有的规模和潜力。因为即使她们的排名仅次于男性，这也是一个荒谬的规模。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>天哪，托宾，但现在我觉得那太好了。你会在海外拥有这样一个令人惊叹的大规模机会吗？我们会拥有伟大的美国团队并持续多年吗？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>小心点，听起来你可能是在支持英格兰队。<br><br><strong>松香：</strong> 【<em>笑。</em> ] 确切地。你知道，我很好奇，里面的体验是什么样的？公平地说，我认为你的意思是，该模式在英国行之有效。你可以明白为什么它在英国行之有效。我们的模式对我们来说效果很好，但是在一个团队中的内部体验是什么？附属于一家著名的男子俱乐部与美国天使城女子球队的经历？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>嗯，我会说我在曼联的时间是在欧洲杯之前，所以我实际上希望这家具乐部和大多数俱乐部都能取得跨越式发展。但我认为天使城也是一种独立的，因为它不仅仅是独立所有权；它是独立的。这是女性所有权。<br><br>因此，当我们在天使城谈论球员需求和球队需求时，谈话的本质是我从未经历过的，因为我正在和那些真正相信我的价值、我们的价值、球队的价值的人交谈。他们之所以从事这项工作，是因为他们想要创造和放大我们这项运动中存在的价值。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>等等。你能详细说明一下吗？就像你对曼联与天使城的做法有何看法？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>是的，我认为，总结一下：投资女性游戏的想法是因为这是<em>正确的</em>做法，我觉得很多男性高管都来自这个领域。而不是投资女子比赛，因为这是一个很棒的商业模式，将为球迷和利益相关者创造大量价值。<br><br>所以，你知道，曼联他们签下了我们。他们认识托宾和我。我们在争取公平和薪酬方面享有盛誉。他们有点知道自己会得到什么。公平地说，他们有一个与我们分享的关于为女性建造设施和成长的计划。<br><br>但这是我们一直听到的情绪。<em>哦，我正在这样做——我知道这是正确的做法。我这样做是为了我的女儿。这是正确的做法。</em>当你与天使城的卡拉·诺特曼和朱莉交谈时，他们这样做是因为他们相信这一点，因为他们相信这是一项伟大的商业举措。<br><br>他们相信我们都会崛起。这股浪潮将一起上涨。<br><br> <strong>[<em>音乐</em>]</strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>我们要短暂休息一下。当我们回来时：1999 年世界杯改变了这项运动。你猜怎么着？希斯和普雷斯都在那里。<br><br> <strong>[<em>音乐</em>]</strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>我回想起你们刚开始的时候。所以，1999 年女足世界杯期间，你一定还不到十几岁，当时人们的兴趣爆发了，决赛在玫瑰碗举行，现场有 90,000 名观众，这是一个巨大的记录。那是你开始意识到足球的那一刻吗？<br><br>因为那一刻感觉你所描述的一切都将在红地毯上铺开。它即将发生。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>是的，当你谈论“11”、“15”、“19”以及所有美国女足世界杯决赛中的黄金一代时，你说得完全正确。 1999 年，我参加了美国女子国家队在新泽西州的首场比赛。克里斯汀参加了玫瑰碗决赛。<br><br>如果你实际上与美国女子国家队的大多数球员交谈过，他们要么参加了其中一场比赛，要么对那场比赛有一个非常震撼的故事。但我想这是我们所有人第一次睁开眼睛说：“哇，我想<em>这么做</em>。”<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>等等，你当时<em>在场</em>吗？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>我参加了揭幕战；克里斯汀进入了决赛。显然我们当时并不认识。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>那太大了。那么你是否认为：<em>哦，足球是一种职业。比如，我可以赚钱。这是我一生都可以专业做的事情吗</em>？<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>是的。这很有趣，因为我是一个非常自大的小孩。 [<em>笑。</em> 】 我还是个趾高气扬的小大人。但那是梅多兰兹，我记得在那里，我和我的足球队一起来，我在草地上踢球。我穿着米娅·哈姆的球衣。我们当时正在玩皮卡。<br><br>我记得当时我心里想——我想我当时只有 12 岁——比如：<em>哇，我现在已经足够优秀了，可以进入那个领域了。</em><br><br><strong>松香：</strong> 【<em>笑。</em> ] 棒极了。太棒了。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>我认为，拥有那种程度的兴趣和热情——当你走进那个体育场，你感受到那种能量，你往球场上看，你看到了一个你相信自己可以成为的榜样——是非常强大的。<br><br>这就是为什么，对于天使城来说，当你走进那个体育场时，性别完全消失了。我认为在那一刻，我们小时候都感受到性别已经完全消失了。这真是太棒了，这是我们未来可以拥有的机会。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong> Christen，你在 1999 年玫瑰碗决赛中的经历是什么？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>是的，实际上我有一张我和我的团队、我的姐妹们和我的脸画着的照片。当我看照片时，我可以在我的眼睛里看到它。我当时想：<em>我能做到。</em>我<em>当时</em>认为我做不到；我还没准备好。但我认为这就是梦想，那就是目标。<br><br>老实说，当我第一次被国家队征召时，我什至不知道这是一份有薪工作。我认为为国家队效力是一种荣幸，是一件令人惊奇的事情，你甚至不会得到报酬。这么说很尴尬，但我认为这很重要，因为即使是我们的球员协会在向世界进行体育教育方面也取得了如此大的进步。女性的经济解放对于我们所争取的社会进步极其重要。因此，希望永远不会有球员在离开时不知道他们所做的事情具有经济价值。<br><br>但对我来说[1999]只是心眼。看看那些在这个层面上受到充分重视、赞赏和庆祝的女性。那里有这么多人，这改变了我的生活，因为它绝对只是看到了我以前从未见过的照片。并看到有机会做一些事情，实现这个梦想并使其达到如此规模。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>我想说的是，就克里斯汀的观点而言，当我真正进入国家队时，我没有得到报酬，因为当我进入国家队时，我刚刚开始上大学。所以我什至没有想过进入国家队是为了拿薪水。对我来说，这只是一种荣誉。我想成为这个团队的一员，了解它的象征和作用。我的第一个世界冠军是 2008 年奥运会，我记得我所有的队友都非常兴奋，因为我加入了球队，因为这意味着如果我们赢了，他们会得到更多的奖金——因为我在大学时没有得到任何奖金运动员。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>天哪。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>所以他们说，<em>是的。很高兴托宾出现在名单上。</em><br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>你能否真正清楚地表达出来——这样听的人才能真正理解——当球员获得报酬时会产生什么不同。我知道这是一个疯狂的问题，但现在你看到人们得到报酬，过着真正的生活，这实际上改变了什么？<br><br><strong>按：</strong>嗯，它改变了一切。我们希望最好的球员、最好的运动员来完成这项工作。这就是推动游戏向前发展的原因。它必须是一种可持续的生活方式。你必须能够将自己的一生奉献给这项运动，并且有足够的钱来度过余生，这样它才能成为一项真正的职业运动。<br><br>因为当你在这些<em>我们得到报酬，但还不够的</em>情况下，我们仍在解决这个问题时，你总是会分心，你必须做其他事情或将你的时间和日子分开，以便赚足够的钱来生存。<br><br>我认为这只会降低这项运动的质量。我们整个职业生涯都在为下一代球员不需要再找工作，不需要在退役后工作，不需要担心职业生涯的到来而奋斗。最后，<em>我该如何继续赚钱？</em>他们不必在周末去诊所，也不必花几百美元去四小时外的诊所，因为他们需要额外的收入。这就是目标。目标是让职业女运动员成为职业运动员。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>是的。我认为这是新一代人必须应对的挑战。我认为我们这一代人中的很多人，我们为我们所得到的每一件事而奋斗，然后是这项运动的未来显然将得到的每一件事。真的感觉像是赚到了一些东西。我知道这样说很奇怪，但是当你从一个白手起家的模式转变为一个赢得同工同酬的模式时，现在这是美国女子国家队和男子国家队第一次在比赛开始之前就得到了同等的报酬，这感觉像是很多基础收入。<br><br>现在我看看这一代人，我认为这是新一代的女性职业运动员。他们面临着新的挑战，因为他们拥有这些个人品牌、这些个人代言，正如克里斯汀所说，这些真正改变了他们成为职业运动员的方式。这就是我们一直在推动的，对吧？<br><br>但他们没有我们为之奋斗的那种基本的收入意识。我认为这将带来一种不同类型的心态，并且这种心态必须通过美国女子国家队的这一过程而不断发展。<br><br>因为美国女足国家队的整体比任何一个部分都更伟大。现在这些零件变得更有价值了。那么各个部分的价值如何影响整体的价值呢？所以这会很有趣——看看未来会是什么样子。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>噢，我明白了。所以你的意思是你们必须作为一个团队来战斗。就像，你们有理由进行这种团结，因为你们正在为这些基本权利而奋斗。然而，这些参与者带着个人品牌——可能是社交媒体品牌、代言等——进来，所以他们在很大程度上是个人，所以他们的挑战是：那么，我们如何团结一致？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>我的意思是，在这场比赛开始之前，他们中的大多数人已经赚到了比我们在 2015 年或 2019 年获胜时赚到的钱更多的钱。所以我们的收入实际上取决于团队的成功。因此，作为一名专业人士，现在的心态非常不同，我们必须观察结果如何。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>对。因为除非你赢了，否则你们甚至不会得到报酬。就像他们会给你奖金一样，但整个团队都必须获胜。这与每个球员要取得的成就无关。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>没错。是的。<br><br><strong>记者：</strong>谈话中有趣的部分是：我们必须赢得世界杯才能赢得同工同酬，但我们是否需要争取同工同酬才能赢得世界杯？<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>嗯。<br><br> <strong>Press：</strong>显然，我们永远不会知道。但我认为每个观看 2019 年世界杯的人都会感觉到我们正在为比我们更伟大的目标而战。我们有这种外部动机，它是如此鼓舞人心、如此团结，以至于我——我是一个有精神的人；我相信这就是我们获胜的原因。我相信我们获胜是因为我们有代表世界各地女性的工作要做。<br><br>现在我们即将进入世界杯，必须有一种不同的无形资产。这场比赛并不是美国女子国家队争取同工同酬的斗争。那么它是什么？你是否需要外部动力来赢得这场比赛？<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>那真的很漂亮。我的意思是，那是什么？你们谈论这个吗？比如，你认为可以让他们走到一起的无形动力是什么？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>我的意思是，他们正在为三连冠历史而战。是的。我认为棘手的是有什么？队里有五名球员真的——<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>确实是三连冠。<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>是的，三连冠。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>所以是他们——他们必须用他们的目标激励每个人。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>是的，球队正在为之奋斗，但实际上只有几个非凡的个人才能赢得三场胜利。其他人，两个，也许一个。但这很有趣。我喜欢你刚才所说的为更多的东西而奋斗。我认为作为一个团体和集体，你会围绕某件事团结起来。<br><br>我不知道那是什么，但我很确定如果这支球队一路进入决赛，我们就会看到它；我们就会知道那是什么东西。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>也许这只是为了梅根·拉皮诺（Megan Rapinoe）。也许这就像三连冠的拉皮诺一样。 [<em>笑。</em> 】 这样就够了。和你们聊天真是太有趣了。基本上，我想从这次谈话中学到的是学会观看这些比赛，并以你们俩的方式看待这个世界。我觉得你们是很棒的向导，我真的很感激。非常感谢你们俩。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>任何时候。<br><br>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊插图。资料来源：Shutterstock。</figcaption></figure>我一生都认为只有一种方法可以到达家乡的 ShopRite：就在 Fair Street，就在 Gleneida Avenue，就在停车场。直到我将 ShopRite 插入 Google 地图。现在我有两个选择。我可以右转进入杂货店前面的停车场，或者，如果我觉得有必要，可以进入靠近戈尔德健身房的地方，穿过沥青海。该应用程序称，两条路线都需要四分钟，但后者赢得了谷歌地图生态模式的认可：一片小绿叶。一条广告告诉我，在我妈妈上 Bodypump 课程之前而不是之后进入停车场，我可以节省 6% 的汽油。我可以尽自己的一份力量来拯救世界。<br><br>谷歌宣布其地图生态路由功能已有两年了。对于美国、加拿大和欧洲大部分地区的所有驾车旅行，该应用程序默认推荐最环保的路线，只要它不比其他路线慢很多。如果路线之间的时间差可以忽略不计，应用程序将默认选择节省汽油的路线。该功能的推出在内部引起了强烈反响。谷歌首席执行官桑达尔·皮查伊 (Sundar Pichai) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/sustainability/sustainability-2021/">表示</a>，它“每年可以减少超过 100 万吨碳排放，相当于减少道路上超过 20 万辆汽车”。<br><br>听起来不错。但考虑到 EPA 估计去年道路车辆二氧化碳排放量约为 15<em>亿吨</em>，并且 2021 年美国注册汽车近 1.03 亿辆，这些数字就不那么令人印象深刻了。小小的绿叶可能会有所帮助一点点，但当我们继续用耗油的私人车辆破坏地球时，它也可能会让像我这样的司机产生一种错误的成就感，从而使事情变得更糟。在感觉小小的推动还不够的时代，生态模式是一个小小的推动——这表明我们每个人实际上愿意为了缓解气候变化而承受多少不便。<br><br>生态模式实际上在多大程度上改变了驾驶员的行为这一问题很难回答。一方面，在很多情况下，谷歌推荐的“绿色”路线与其本来提供的路线完全相同。 “绝大多数时候，最快的路线和最省油的路线都是一样的，”谷歌地图产品经理 Rosa Wu 告诉我，尽管该公司无法提供任何精确的数字。吴说，在有多种选择的情况下，生态模式确实使驾驶员在计划行程时更容易选择更可持续的路线。<br><br> <a href="http://EVs%20Are%20Sending%20Toxic%20Tire%20Particles%20Into%20the%20Water,%20Soil,%20and%20Air">阅读：电动汽车将有毒轮胎颗粒排放到水、土壤和空气中</a><br><br>当我与忧思科学家联盟清洁交通项目的高级工程师 David Reichmuth 交谈时，他向该应用程序询问从他在加利福尼亚州奥克兰的家到他父母在佩塔卢马（西北约 45 英里）的家的路线。结果非常棒：“它说现在我将节省 62% 的汽油，”他向我讲述了 40 分钟的旅程。但另一种选择是绕行两个小时，向南到达圣何塞，向北穿过旧金山，越过金门大桥（并避免 7 美元的过路费）。 “所以我想，是的，”他说，“相比逆向驾驶，确实可以节省 60% 的费用。”<br><br>当经济模式的建议确实与可用的最快路线不同时，估计节省多少汽油就不是小事了。为了计算其生态路线，谷歌地图依赖于国家可再生能源实验室研究科学家雅各布·霍尔登（Jacob Holden）共同创建的车辆能源消耗模型。霍尔顿告诉我，预测特定车辆在特定路径上以特定速度消耗多少汽油是一个相当简单的工程问题，但当道路条件和人们的个人驾驶风格无法预测时，传递这些信息就更困难了。 “你和我以及我们的 1,000 个朋友可以在同一条路上行驶，但我们的驾驶方式会略有不同，”他告诉我。尽管如此，他认为生态模式的预测大致准确。他在 2018 年与人合着的一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0361198118798286">论文</a>发现，NREL 目前的方法“应该在 90% 的时间内准确选择燃料消耗最少的路线。”<br><br>除了相信谷歌的话之外，我们也无法了解生态模式对气候的净影响。南安普顿大学行为科学教授 Konstantinos Katsikopoulos 特别希望看到有关 20 万辆汽车这一数字的更多数据。尽管谷歌 2023 年环境报告中的 200 字尾注概述了该公司如何达到这一数字，但其中并未包含原始数据。 “也许他们认为没有人有兴趣了解更多，或者他们无法理解，”他告诉我。但对他来说，这似乎是不透明的。<br><br><a

Climate Change (IPCC) report, according to a summary by one of its co-chairs, concluded that “having the right policies, infrastructure and technology in place to enable changes to our lifestyles and behaviour can result in a 40–70% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.” Google Maps isn&#39;t helping people buy electric vehicles, retrofit their houses with energy-efficient technologies, or install heat pumps—changes that would undoubtedly carry a much larger benefit—but it&#39;s still a behavior change. If small reminders incorporated into tools people already use in their daily lives could make a real dent in emissions, the world might indeed warm more slowly. And in that sense, eco-mode&#39;s successes are as instructive as its shortcomings.<br><br> But that doesn&#39;t mean people will <em>use</em> it when the more sustainable choice is actually slower. Holden told me that, on his own trips, he&#39;ll more often than not take the eco-route, but it&#39;s not always great. “There are certainly times where I&#39;ll be given a route that&#39;s recommended as efficient and we&#39;ll just kind of chuckle at the impracticality,” he told me. If the app instructs him to  avoid the highway in favor of a slightly longer drive through a series of stoplights, he&#39;ll believe the recommendation—it&#39;s based on his own model, after all—but still drive the highway route. “And I think that&#39;s really interesting,” he said. “Me of all people, I&#39;m reaching that conclusion.”<br><br> To impress the benefits of the eco-routes upon drivers like Holden, Google is considering retooling how its eco-routes are presented, Wu told me. Maps doesn&#39;t display emissions estimates—such as carbon-dioxide equivalent—because they&#39;re confusing for regular drivers, she said. “When we were doing research, we found that users had no conception of emissions.” But the percentages might not be persuasive enough to change people&#39;s behavior. Instead of “saves 2% gas,” the company is thinking of presenting potential financial savings at some point— <em>take this route, spend four more minutes driving, and save $1.45</em> .<br><br> Kate Brandt, Google&#39;s chief sustainability officer, told me repeatedly that the goal of programs like eco-mode and Google Flights&#39; carbon-footprint calculation (which estimates how many kilograms of CO2 I&#39;ll contribute to the atmosphere depending on which flight I pick) is to provide “helpful information that people are seeking.” But as I scrolled through Maps over the past few weeks, I wondered who was seeking some of the information Google offered: the route to upstate New York that would take 40 more minutes and, depending on the time of day, possibly save me 2 percent on emissions; the ShopRite parking-lot maneuver that would save a couple of teaspoons of gas.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/04/electric-ev-rickshaw-sales-climate-change/673629/">Read: America is missing out on the biggest EV boom of all</a><br><br> If Google Maps is so intent on showing me the greenest way to get to the grocery store, its eco-friendly nod would perhaps more helpfully be directed toward a non-driving option. Though Google Maps provides helpful walking, biking, public-transit, and mixed-mode directions, no amount of industrious trekking will earn you a green leaf. Reichmuth thinks this is a mistake. When he pulled up routes from his home to San Francisco&#39;s Oracle Park, he wondered why Google bestowed the eco seal of approval on <em>any</em> driving route when he could take public transit, get there in about the same amount of time, and not waste minutes and fuel parking.<br><br> Holden, despite his gas-use models, felt similarly. “The actual solution here is to get on your bike and go to Trader Joe&#39;s,” he said. “That will be the most efficient path.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 15:11:55 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/google-maps-eco-mode-driving-efficiency/674904/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/google-maps-eco-mode-driving-efficiency/674904/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The UCLA Students Who Live in Their Cars]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The widespread, poorly understood phenomenon of vehicular homelessness <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/svLnWCK_np8ob9lJOqdhCIHnICk=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/living_in_car_horz-1/original.jpg" alt="加利福尼亚州的一辆车" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>本·科特/《大西洋月刊》插图。 Source: Getty</figcaption></figure> T <span class="smallcaps">he month I moved</span> to Los Angeles felt apocalyptic, even by the standards of a city forever being destroyed in film. It was the end of the summer of 2020; stores were closed, streets empty, and wildfires had enveloped the region in smoke, turning the sky orange. Yet after I parked the U-Haul, things got even bleaker.<br><br> Walking to my new apartment, I passed a car where a 20-something had passed out with the engine running. Folks, I noticed, were sleeping in nearly every car on the street—a mix, I would later learn, of UCLA students and construction workers.<br><br> I had never encountered vehicular homelessness before moving out West. Indeed, it hadn&#39;t even registered to me as a possibility, as a thing one might do to avoid sleeping on the street. In New York City, most homeless people don&#39;t own cars, and in any case, the city has a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/new-york-city-s-right-to-shelter-mandate-for-homelessness-faces-new-test">legal obligation</a> to provide shelter. This is not true in California.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lahsa.org/data?id=54-homeless-count-by-city-community">Nearly 20,000 Angelenos</a> live in RVs, vans, or cars, a 55 percent increase over when the count first started, in 2016. As the housing shortage deepens, thousands more will likely be forced into this lifestyle. Many of these people do not have the mental-health or substance-abuse issues eagerly trotted out to dismiss the homelessness crisis. A significant minority have jobs—they&#39;re people who stock shelves or install drywall but simply can&#39;t afford a home.<br><br> Like most Angelenos, I was repulsed by the homelessness crisis, vehicular or otherwise. Early in the summer of 2021, I temporarily joined the 20,000. Amid COVID-19 lockdowns, I was paying half of my income for a bedroom in a shared student apartment furnished like a doctor&#39;s office waiting room. My lease was set to expire, and I had to travel for work, anyway. Moving into my Prius seemed like the best bad option.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">ngelenos love their cars</span> , the stereotype goes. Our city&#39;s distinctive natural wonder is, after all, the tar pits: Los Angeles wants to be paved over. And many see a certain American romance in a stretch of living, free and unencumbered, on the road.<br><br> Search YouTube for <em>living out of a Prius</em> and the first thing you&#39;ll <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NikkiDelventhal/videos">find</a> is a former <em>Bachelor</em> contestant and NFL cheerleader who has pulled in millions of views for her travels in a mint-green 2006 Prius. Hundreds of social-media accounts offer similar adventures. Their styles vary, but the pitch is consistent: Save money; see the country; live your best life.<br><br> Why the Prius in particular? Unlike vans or RVs, the Toyota hybrid offers escape at rock-bottom prices. A 10-year-old beat-up Prius can run as low as $7,500. The car enjoys minimal maintenance and high gas mileage, and thanks to the hybrid battery, you can leave it running overnight for heat or AC.<br><br> Online communities such as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/priusdwellers/">r/priusdwellers</a> Subreddit celebrate novel builds—lifted <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/priusdwellers/comments/vje1kd/happiness_is_overlanding_with_your_lift_kit/">Priuses</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/priusdwellers/comments/sgt42v/hey_heres_how_i_installed_a_solar_panel_on_my_gen/">Priuses</a> with solar panels, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/priusdwellers/comments/pwrogr/my_humble_abode/">Priuses</a> with more storage than an IKEA showroom. But my <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RYCkSMMXtY">build</a> <u>was basic</u> : Drop the rear seats, stack a 28-quart container on a 54-quart container on the floor, and put a pillow on top to create a flat, six-foot-long clearing. Lay down a yoga mat, a mattress topper, and a sleeping pad, and you have a bed more comfortable than any hotel mattress. You can add rods for hanging curtains and clothes, a sunscreen and rain guards for privacy.<br><br> On my first day living out of my Prius, I whizzed up the Pacific Coast Highway before hopping over to the 101, which runs through the sleepy Salinas Valley of Steinbeck fame. As the sun started to set, I realized that I hadn&#39;t planned out where I was going to camp for the night and was forced to make my first rookie mistake: sleeping at a highway rest area.<br><br> The parking lot was packed with people living out of vehicles—truckers in semis, middle-class retirees in RVs, Millennials in tricked-out vans, and quite a few people in cars poorly suited to vehicle living, with stacks of luggage filling passenger seats and shirts pinched into closed windows to serve as curtains.<br><br> As I lay in the back of my Prius, reading by headlamp, I looked over to see a family of four sleeping in an old Honda Accord. A man slept in a reclined driver&#39;s seat. A child stretched across the back seat. In the front passenger seat, a woman cradled a sleeping toddler. I hoped it was only for the night—some mix-up or scheduling mistake—but I suspected otherwise.<br><br> At stops like this, I often talked with fellow travelers, quickly finding a surprising degree of camaraderie among vehicle dwellers. Of course, many just want to be left alone, but others share food, jump one another&#39;s stalled-out vehicles, and—most important of all—swap notes on where it&#39;s safe to park.<br><br> The next day, I drove through San Francisco up to southern Oregon. Using <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://freecampsites.net/">Free Campsites</a> , a peer-to-peer platform for finding and reviewing camping locations, I picked a patch of Bureau of Land Management property just off I-5. For people living out of vehicles on the cheap, BLM land is the gold standard of campgrounds—parking is free for up to 14 days, and the sites are quiet, safe, and at least vaguely scenic.<br><br> After spending a few days with relatives in the Willamette Valley, I broke east toward Boise along Route 20, driving through a dust storm in the eastern Oregon Badlands. I stopped off in the foothills of the Boise National Forest, then beelined to a BLM campsite north of Yellowstone, where I spent a few days working off a mobile hotspot, free of distraction.<br><br> My experiment in vehicle dwelling was supposed to wrap up around this time. I had to get back to Los Angeles to help teach classes at UCLA. But the vacancy rate for apartments in the city was low, my Ph.D. stipend was paltry, and I was facing some unexpected debt. I realized I wouldn&#39;t be moving out of the Prius anytime soon.<br><br> S <span class="smallcaps">leeping in a car</span> in the city is much grimmer than in remote areas. Many cities <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2022.2050936">ban vehicle living entirely</a> , though often a de facto ban is enforced through parking policies, such as permit requirements or limited hours.<br><br> Los Angeles deploys a zone system, dividing the city into a patchwork of areas where vehicle living isn&#39;t and is tolerated. Places where it&#39;s not tolerated tend to be nice and well lit—residential neighborhoods and parking lots. Streets where it is tolerated tend to be dark and isolated, the kinds of places where you risk being the victim of a break-in. Sleep on the wrong street at the wrong time, and you could be ticketed, towed, or woken by police officers knocking on the window in the middle of the night.<br><br> When I didn&#39;t need to be close to campus, I often slept in the Angeles National Forest, just northeast of La Cañada Flintridge. Forest rangers there turn a mercifully blind eye to the dozens of families who sleep each night in dirt pullouts along Angeles Crest Highway. When I did need to be close to school, I slept among other UCLA students and construction workers a few blocks from campus—the exact scene that had so repulsed me when I first moved to Los Angeles.<br><br> There are three categories of vehicle living in Los Angeles. And thanks to citywide counts, we know exactly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/mnolangray/up206-nolan-group/d443cc9b7150f167a9af1bf07c232dd19dd13e36/group_assignments/la_total.html">where</a> each group clusters. Slightly more than half of the people living out of vehicles are in RVs. Large and conspicuous, RVs are typically <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.2141094,-118.3602808,3a,83.2y,90.64h,93.12t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJ9YsJDeXcN6JU7l5HQwt9A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192">tolerated</a> only in industrial areas, where they line many streets. Roughly one in six live in vans. Thanks to the popularity of “van life” culture, they tend to concentrate in hip, beachside neighborhoods like Venice.<br><br> And then there are cars. By the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lahsa.org/data?id=54-homeless-count-by-city-community">official count</a> , they house nearly a quarter of people who live out of vehicles, but this is almost certainly an undercount, because cars and their residents blend in. Relative to other people struggling with homelessness, they <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10511482.2022.2117990">are more likely</a> to be white, women, parents, and only temporarily homeless.<br><br> Of course, vehicle living can pose sanitation and public-health concerns. But criminalizing it, as so many cities effectively do, does nothing to address the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/01/homelessness-affordable-housing-crisis-democrats-causes/672224/">obvious</a> underlying cause of vehicular homelessness—a lack of housing. It just makes people&#39;s already hard lives harder.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he good news</span> is that some cities are reforming these policies. Starting with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://carbajal.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1026#:~:text=The%20very%20first%20safe%20parking,original%20champion%20of%20the%20program.">Santa Barbara in 2004</a> , many cities have implemented “safe parking” programs, setting aside parking lots where people who live out of cars can park overnight free of harassment. The facilities are often hosted by faith groups, and the best ones provide security, bathrooms and showers, and access to case workers who can connect residents with social services.<br><br> But by one <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://priceschool.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Smart-Practices-for-Safe-Parking-USC-2021.pdf">estimate</a> , Los Angeles provides fewer than 500 such parking spots. Even if the city converted all <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ladotparking.org/parking-facilities/">11,400 public parking spaces</a> into safe parking, it still wouldn&#39;t be enough.<br><br> Here at UCLA, where <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2022-11-17/gimme-shelter-californias-housing-crisis-forces-college-students-into-homelessness">one in 20</a> students will at some point struggle with homelessness, administrators have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/15/ucla-rejects-parking-space-proposal-for-students-experiencing-homelessness">rejected</a> student-led <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/safeparkingucla/">requests</a> for on-campus safe parking—a campaign organized in part by one of my former students who spent a few months living out of his car on the same Westwood street where I would occasionally sleep. Perhaps it would be embarrassing for the university to admit that many students live out of vehicles. But is the alternative any less embarrassing?<br><br> If the student-homelessness crisis has a silver lining, it&#39;s that it seems to have created a generation of activists committed to reform. You can throw a rock at pro-housing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cayimby.org/">YIMBY</a> (“Yes in My Backyard”) gatherings and hit someone who has been forced to live out of a car. That includes Muhammad Alameldin, a researcher at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation. He was a student at Berkley when a snafu with roommates and a brutal Bay Area housing shortage pushed him into his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://peninsulapress.com/2022/07/19/advocate-for-affordable-housing-was-once-homeless-himself/">Prius for three months</a> .<br><br> Like Alameldin, I moved back into an apartment after three months of living in my Prius, a period made manageable by the occasional stay in a cheap hotel or with friends and family.<br><br> Ask anyone living out of a car how they fell into this life, and they will likely say: “I wanted to live free”; “I wanted to see the country”; “I wanted to go on an adventure.” But let the conversation carry on for more than a few minutes, and you will inevitably bump into a sadder origin story: a layoff, a divorce, a death, a foreclosure, an eviction.<br><br> The urge to roam is human.

But it&#39;s never been apparent to me that <em>needing</em> redemption in the way a person convicted of a heinous crime does makes that person&#39;s desire for it necessarily dishonest; I&#39;m more inclined to see it the opposite way. And in James “Jimi” Barber&#39;s case, he needed the redemption.<br><br> Barber would&#39;ve been the first to tell you as much. In his view, his own life ended the night in May 2001 when, in the midst of a crack-cocaine and alcohol binge, he murdered a 75-year-old grandmother, Dorothy “Dottie” Epps, in her rural Alabama home—not just in that it presaged his own death sentence, but in the sense that he destroyed a slew of prized relationships in that frenzied act of violence. Dottie was the mother of Barber&#39;s former girlfriend, and Barber had become close with the family, attending his girlfriend&#39;s niece&#39;s high-school graduation and working on Dottie&#39;s house in advance of her grandson&#39;s wedding. But all of that—meaningful relationships amid a life otherwise hard—was abruptly wasted within a night, and Barber knew it.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/james-barber-alabama-death-row-forgiveness/674181/">Elizabeth Bruenig: A murder forgiven</a><br><br> He narrated his guilt to Sarah Gregory, Dottie&#39;s granddaughter, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/james-barber-alabama-death-row-forgiveness/674181/">in a letter</a> sent in the autumn of 2020. “The self-loathing, shame, shock and utter disbelief at what took place at my own hand almost overcame me,” he wrote. “If not for God&#39;s grace I would be gone.” Barber told Gregory that he initially had trouble adjusting to life behind bars: “I was fighting quite a lot, for a while almost daily. My shame, anger, and denial and the &#39;culture shock&#39; [of incarceration] were more than I could bear. I lashed out at anyone who was a threat, real or imagined.”<br><br> Barber needed a diversion. And with few entertainment options available—a snowy television with a tinfoil antenna, a book per month passing through—Barber eventually turned to the word of God. “Boredom made me pick up the Bible,” he wrote to Gregory, herself a person of faith, “and it saved, at that time, my worthless life.”<br><br> Barber&#39;s Bible study began simply, with a single read-through, then another. Then, he began to examine the books of the Bible one by one. Over time, Barber said, he attained letters of accreditation in 27 books of the Bible through correspondence courses. He told Gregory that he had read the Bible seven times completely. He prevailed upon authorities at the county jail where he was being held at the time to allow him to be baptized on October 6, 2001, the day he considered his “true birthday.”<br><br> Early in his spiritual journey, Barber decided that his would be a complete transformation: “I made a promise to myself in that nasty, dirty, evil county jail, I was never going to become &#39;a convict,&#39;” he wrote to Gregory. “I made up my mind that when I left prison either on my feet or in a body bag I was going to be a better man than when I arrived.”<br><br> Barber&#39;s opportunity to test that conviction came most clearly during the last week of his life, when he again had the chance to face both his family and the family of his victim.<br><br> By that time, Barber had already conducted a years-long correspondence with Gregory, who sat down with me in the lobby of a Holiday Inn in Atmore, Alabama, the day before Barber&#39;s scheduled execution. Since reconnecting via written correspondence in 2020, Barber and Gregory had spent hours on the phone discussing life—in particular, Gregory&#39;s young son. Now, at the end, they were spending much of their remaining time together laughing.<br><br> “It was very surreal,” Gregory told me of the gathering in the visitation yard. “But his faith was very strong. He has this unbelievable amount of peace to him right now amongst everything.” The atmosphere was open, affectionate, warm. Barber was “laughing and carrying on.” At one point members of Barber&#39;s family gathered for a group picture, and called Gregory in when she stepped off to the side. Gregory had been expecting something sadder than what she found: a man curiously unafraid to die.<br><br> From the time I met Barber earlier this year, he was adamant about his disposition toward his sentence: “I have no fear,” he told me back in March. “I have none.” A week before he was to die, he sent me an email from Alabama&#39;s death row: “I&#39;m in excellent spirits, Miss Liz!! God has been so faithful and kind to me! Many incredible things occurring just making His presence known! No fear or dread Miss Liz. Just a reverent awe for my Lord. See you soon, in Christ, Jimi.” We had hoped we would get to meet in person, but the Alabama Department of Corrections refused to allow me to visit with Barber. ADOC also refused Kathy Trapp, Gregory&#39;s mother and one of Dottie Epps&#39;s daughters—but she got in anyhow.<br><br> “Very few … victims come and talk to the guy, or even much less hug the guy, that killed their mother,” Trapp pointed out, sitting beside her daughter in the Holiday Inn that Wednesday afternoon. But that&#39;s what had happened earlier that day when Trapp had simply followed Gregory into the visitation yard, momentarily slipping past guards monitoring the inflow of approved visitors. Before they recognized their mistake, Trapp told me, she and Barber quickly embraced. He was crying, she recalled, and told her, “I&#39;m so sorry.” Trapp had forgiven him a long time ago, but the hug “finished it,” she said. “Even just for the few minutes I got to go in,” she continued—“I can&#39;t really explain it. I literally can&#39;t. But it meant a lot to me.”<br><br> Barber had told another prisoner that he had faith he would get to see Trapp before the end, despite the fact that ADOC had denied her entry. Sitting across from Gregory and Trapp in the dull heat of Alabama&#39;s coastal summer, I was glad to hear that his faith had been rewarded.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">The night before</span> Barber&#39;s scheduled execution, members of his family joined Trapp and Gregory for dinner. They were also accompanied by Nathan “Nat” Watkins, an Alabama lawyer and volunteer minister Barber had befriended during his first year in prison. Watkins served as Barber&#39;s spiritual adviser, and was with Barber the following day as he prepared for the end of his life.<br><br> “He told me Thursday evening,” Watkins said: “&#39;This was the week that I wanted; this is just what I wanted it to be.&#39;” Seeing his family there with Gregory and Trapp had been the closure he needed. A warden had let them bring in a guitar, Watkins told me, and the group had sang Paul Simon and gospel music, including a rendition of “Amazing Grace” requested by a female correctional officer. Barber led a march around the yard to “When the Saints Go Marching In.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/alabama-death-penalty-kenneth-smith-execution/672220/">Elizabeth Bruenig: A history of violence</a><br><br> Eventually, all of Barber&#39;s visitors were taken from him, and he was left alone in the death-watch holding cell with a phone to contact his lawyers and little else. By that time, the last of his emergency appeals had been filed with the US Supreme Court, and he could do nothing but wait for its ruling to decide his fate. I spent the evening loitering in hotel lobbies—as 6 pm, the scheduled time of his execution, came and went—with Mara Klebaner, one of Barber&#39;s attorneys, and John Gallo, a former attorney of his. Seven pm became eight, and eight closed in on nine and then 10. Around that time Gregory texted me to ask me how we were holding up. “Just nervous,” I said, and returned the question. “Nervous and pacing,” she replied.<br><br> While we waited, Barber stayed on the phone with another of his attorneys, who talked with him as the hours wore on and, finally, read the Bible to him until he fell asleep. I was surprised Barber was able to sleep at all, knowing that he could at any moment be awoken by guards to be taken to the gurney where he would be killed, but Barber was evidently more at ease than I had anticipated.<br><br> Neither had I predicted just how much a member of a victim&#39;s family might come to dread an execution. But Gregory had told me the day before that she was “losing a friend tomorrow … I would&#39;ve never thought I would&#39;ve ever said that. He was a friend of mine, and I&#39;m gonna miss him.” So much of that was a testament to Barber&#39;s own penitence, the way he had thrown himself into Gregory&#39;s forgiveness and forged a bond from the remnants of what he had broken. If a person is largely a composite of all their relationships and Barber had destroyed himself with his original crime, then he seemed to have refashioned himself somehow, mainly off the strength of his faith. Perhaps that&#39;s why he seemed so peaceful about dying; he had already experienced a miracle, and didn&#39;t have to wonder whether people can be reborn.<br><br> C <span class="smallcaps">apital punishment</span> is indifferent to redemption. About 10 minutes after midnight on July 21, the Supreme Court ruled that Barber&#39;s execution could go forward. A little over half an hour later, Klebaner, Gallo, and I were in a prison van headed toward the grounds of the William C. Holman Correctional Facility, where Alabama conducts its executions. Once inside, we were led through a metal detector and shuffled into the witness room attached to the execution chamber: a small cinder-block area with a decaying fluorescent light flickering over several rows of chairs all facing a window with a curtain drawn across from the inside. From within, dulled by the glass, we could hear Barber talking with other occupants of the execution chamber. Whatever he said, it made them laugh.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/joe-nathan-james-execution-alabama/671127/">Elizabeth Bruenig: Dead to rights</a><br><br> Eventually someone pulled the curtain aside. Barber was swaddled in a white sheet and strapped to the gurney, looking mild and calm. Watkins stood across the small room from him. When Terry Raybon, one of Holman&#39;s wardens, offered Barber the opportunity to share his last words, Barber noted that he hadn&#39;t been able to bring paper into the room to read off of. Had he been permitted to read the words he intended, Barber would have said:<br><br><p> God is so good! My life was over. Someone whom I loved&#39;s life was over. I was in jail with no bond, no chances left. At the edge of the Abyss. Everything gone in the wink of an eye. But… I opened a Bible. And God reached down, lifted me up in His hands and said, “Now, you are ready for me to use as an instrument for My glory.”!!! ……</p><p> God is the creator of everything. He created a new thing in me. Gave me wisdom I never had and assured me of a permanent dwelling place in his presence! I&#39;ve strived to show Him my love and utter awe at the great gift He gave by the way I&#39;ve tried to live. At times, I know I&#39;ve failed to do my best. But I made up my mind early on that mere words could not express my sorrow at what had occurred at my hands. And so I hoped that the way I lived my life would be a testimony to the family of Dorothy Epps and also my family, of the regret and shame I have for what I&#39;ve done. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;ve succeeded. That&#39;s not for me to judge. But I also told my brother on the phone from the county jail that I was never going to become a convict. Said I wouldn&#39;t cut my hair like one, conduct myself like one. I wanted, when I either walk out of prison or am carried out in a body bag, to be a better man than when I walked into prison.</p><p> I hope God finds my efforts worthy. I hope the Epps family will know I did the only thing that I thought could show my deep regret, and it helps them somehow. Please pray for the Epps family. I love them deeply. Pray for my family, for peace and strength.</p><p> May the God of all creation create a new thing for each of you and lead you into the greatest, most spiritual era of your lives.</p><p> Be instruments for His glory! I love you and thank you in Christ.</p> Lying there, Barber <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/alabama-death-penalty-lethal-injection-50a202c6c71dd7ea269c722b9c5afe0a">remembered</a> to forgive Alabama Governor Kay Ivey “and the people in this room … for what you are about to do.”<br><br> Watkins stepped forward, touched Barber&#39;s foot, and said a silent prayer. Barber looked at him and said that he was ready. Then the drugs began to flow through the IV tubing that ran from an unseen area behind the chamber wall into his hand, and Barber closed his eyes. A little before two in the morning, it was over.<br><br> I left Alabama in the predawn dark, almost as soon as prison officials returned us to the casino hotel that the ADOC uses as a rendezvous point for witnesses. The state had at last managed what prisoners and their attorneys had been demanding since last year&#39;s string of three botched executions: an unremarkable judicial killing. And Barber had atoned for his crime. The two things seemed only faintly, antagonistically related, which made what Barber had achieved all the more significant to me. In spite of the state of Alabama, and in spite of what he had done that night in 2001, he had died well.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/jimi-barber-alabama-botched-execution/674897/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/jimi-barber-alabama-botched-execution/674897/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Bronze Age Pervert Charmed the Far Right]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> An internet personality who espouses fascism, racism, and bodybuilding has won influential converts. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/X35VKnlDAd_EfiRV75a7zZd-2fo=/0x5:2105x2636/648x810/media/img/2023/07/26/0923_WEL_BAP3/original.jpg" alt="illustration with sculpture of muscular bearded man standing on Ionic column surrounded by animals including sheep, goats, lions, and an elephant, with burning bald eagle falling from sky" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Nicolás Ortega.

The significance of this role could not have been obvious at the time, either to Novak (who was in high school) or to its victims, the bewildered patrons of Boston&#39;s Museum of Fine Arts. Novak had recruited a Romanian classmate with a deep voice, and together they&#39;d <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.boston.com/uncategorized/noprimarytagmatch/2011/11/23/b-j-novak-confesses-to-mfa-prank/">recorded an audio tour</a> for the exhibition “Tales From the Land of Dragons: 1,000 Years of Chinese Painting.” With the help of friends, they then slipped cassettes containing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tenderbutton.com/bmfa/bmfa.mp3">their tour</a> into the museum&#39;s official audio guides.<br><br> Art lovers must have wondered about the thick Eastern European accent that greeted them, over the twang of a Chinese string instrument. The Romanian soon became opinionated (“Personally,” he said, “I think this painting is a piece of crap”), then deranged. He alluded to his “disgusting anatomical abnormalities.” He called his listeners “decadent imperialist maggots” and confessed a desire to smash a glass case with a sledgehammer and “rip [a] scroll to shreds with my teeth, which, by the way, are extremely long and sharp … more like fangs than human teeth.” At last he offered an interlude of “idiot music” while he fumbled with his script. “This should keep you occupied, you drooling imbecile!” he bellowed at the listeners, by now either amused or complaining to management. The last several minutes were a cha-cha by Tito Puente.<br><br> Exit Novak from the stage of American fascism. (His last known political donation was $1,000 to Hillary Clinton in 2016.) But the Romanian has kept in character, complete with the peevish attitude and hammed-up accent. About the time Novak went on <i>Letterman</i> , the Romanian began posting on social media as “Bronze Age Pervert,” a mad-in-both-senses weirdo who had escaped the Museum of Fine Arts and now aimed to take over the world. His message, delivered in tweets, podcasts, and a self-published book, mixes ultra-far-right politics, unabashed racism, and a deep knowledge of ancient Greece. He has never shown his face or admitted his real name. But I know Bronze Age Pervert, and have known him almost as long as BJ Novak has. He&#39;s an MIT graduate who grew up in Newton, Massachusetts. His name is Costin Alamariu.<br><br> It is hard to convey precisely what BAP believes, in part because his views are so outlandish that even when stated simply, they sound like incoherent ranting. America&#39;s civic religion holds that all humans have inherent and equal worth, that they should not be graded according to beauty or nobility, and that they should not aim to destroy one another. BAP says this orthodoxy is exactly wrong. He argues that the natural and desirable condition of life is the domination of the weak and ugly by the strong and noble. He considers American cities a “wasteland” run by Jews and Black people, though the words he uses to denote these groups are considerably less genteel than these.<br><br> The modern state, he says, has been designed to empower the feebleminded and the misshapen at the expense of their betters. The strong and noble must humiliate and conquer their tormentors and destroy their institutions. On Twitter, where he has more than 100,000 followers, BAP posts images of seminude Aryan beefcakes, usually in tropical settings, to celebrate the physical perfection of the warrior element of the race that he hopes will someday be restored to dominance.<br><br> The world, or at least parts of it, has been more receptive to BAP than one might think. By now he is a leading cultural figure on the fascist right—among both elites, who have cottoned to his political philosophy, and non-elites, who love his brio and aspire to his erudition.<br><br> I consider myself a connoisseur of brilliant lunatics, and I have a high tolerance for their lunacy if it has compensating virtues of, say, humor or ingenuity. But even I find BAP worrisome. What starts as comedy can become something more sinister—and BAP&#39;s shtick, while sometimes hilarious, shows every sign of transforming into a new mode of far-right radicalism, with fans in positions of responsibility and power.<br><br> Typically philosophy books go unread even by the philosophers&#39; closest friends and family. But BAP&#39;s book, <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> (2018), tumbled screeching into the world, unignorable, at one point ranking among the top 150 books in the entire Amazon catalog. “It&#39;s still a cult book,” a former Trump White House official <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/23/alt-right-book-trump-1472413">told <i>Politico</i> in 2019</a> . “If you&#39;re a young person, intelligent, adjacent in some way to the right, it&#39;s very likely you would have heard of it.” His podcast, <i>Caribbean Rhythms</i> , has likewise won an avid following.<br><br> Only the most incautious admit their devotion. BAP tells his young disciples to burrow into government, to deny him publicly, to wait. Matthew Kriner, with the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, monitors the social-media activity of groups that are trying to ignite race wars and revive fascist movements. Their accounts have unsubtle Teutonic names such as Atomwaffen. “Bronze Age Pervert is across the vast majority of them,” Kriner told me. Moreover, he has an odd crossover appeal—among both extremely online misfits and figures with real-world influence. BAP, Kriner said, “represents that bridge to get you from really not-acceptable content to maybe ending up in someone&#39;s legislative activities, within a very reasonable amount of time.”<br><br> BAP&#39;s relationship to Donald Trump has been curious. He refers to the former president repeatedly, almost in the manner of a Homeric epithet, as a Borscht Belt comedian, a master of yuks. To BAP, Trump&#39;s chief virtue is destruction. He views the former president fondly, as a kindred insult comic, brazenly impious and generally right about race and immigration. The affection has been repaid in print by Michael Anton, a former Trump-administration national-security official who wrote <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/are-the-kids-altright/">a 2019 essay</a> in the <i>Claremont Review of Books</i> sympathetic to BAP, while noting his tendency to be “racist,” “anti-Semitic,” “anti-democratic,” “misogynistic,” and “homophobic.” Anton suggested (correctly, I think) that BAP&#39;s vile utterances, whether sincere or not, serve a purpose: to keep whiny leftists so busy cataloging his petty thoughtcrimes that they overlook his more serious heresies. Meanwhile, those capable of reading him without being rage-blinded quietly learn from him and heed his advice to bond, network, and plot.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/us-extremism-portland-george-floyd-protests-january-6/673088/">From the April 2023 issue: America&#39;s terrifying cycle of extremist violence</a><br><br> Anton wrote that BAP “speaks directly to a youthful dissatisfaction (especially among white males) with equality as propagandized and imposed in our day: a hectoring, vindictive, resentful, leveling, hypocritical equality that punishes excellence and publicly denies all difference while at the same time elevating and enriching a decadent, incompetent, and corrupt elite.” Anton, who was once a graduate student in political philosophy, ended his essay by prognosticating a BAPist future: “In the spiritual war for the hearts and minds of the disaffected youth on the right, conservatism is losing. BAPism is winning.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">BAPism, for all</span> its emphasis on bodily perfection, began as an intellectual phenomenon, and its first victories came in intellectual circles. They were so subtle that even the guardians of those circles recognized their enemy only after he was already within the gates.<br><br> Last year, at a conference of political philosophers at Michigan State University, a Yale professor named Bryan Garsten told his colleagues that they were in trouble. The topic of the conference was liberalism—not Ted Kennedy liberalism, but the classical version that predates the modern Democratic Party and indeed America itself. Liberalism is the view that individuals have rights and beliefs, and that politics involves safeguarding rights and making compromises when beliefs conflict. It has existed for only a few centuries and is by some measures the most successful idea in history. Just look where people want to live: the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, all liberal places that people will risk their life to reach.<br><br> But <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6kyGVHIJ0">Garsten said</a> liberalism had some of his best students hopping into rafts and paddling in other intellectual directions. He said they had been “captured” by the belief “that to be morally serious, one faces a choice.” The choice, he said, is not between liberalism and illiberalism. Liberalism had already lost. Its greatest champion, the United States, had run aground after pointless wars, terminal decadence, and bureaucratic takeover by activists and special interests. Garsten said his best students were choosing between the protofascism of Nietzsche and a neomedieval, quasi-theocratic version of Catholicism opposed to Enlightenment liberalism. These students considered liberal democracy an exhausted joke, and they hinted—and sometimes did more than hint—that the past few centuries had been a mistake, and that the mistake should now be corrected.<br><br> Some at the conference countered that these illiberals might have just not done their homework. “Your students need to become better readers,” said Diana J. Schaub, a political-science professor at Loyola University Maryland. But Garsten&#39;s illiberal students were good readers. Their deficiencies lay elsewhere, possibly everywhere but there.<br><br> Many of the participants knew that Garsten was talking about the threat posed by Bronze Age Pervert, though his name was uttered with great reluctance. Partly this reluctance came from political philosophers&#39; unwillingness to admit that they browse the Twitter feed of a genocidal nudist. Partly it was their worry that they had unwittingly been complicit in BAPism&#39;s spread by sending their students to intern in Washington, and to staff offices on Capitol Hill and in conservative institutions such as the Heritage Foundation.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/harlan-crow-clarence-thomas-relationship/674092/">Graeme Wood: Harlan Crow wants to stop talking about Clarence Thomas</a><br><br> From there, BAPism reached members of the right who lack philosophical training—young men whose main interest is not in the rise or fall of the American civic religion but in something more primal, an urge they themselves hardly understand, let alone control. “There is a level of self-loathing, chronic-masturbating anger out there among adolescent and early-20s fucked-up males,” one Republican operative told me. To them the world is dry, purposeless, and designed for the flourishing of anyone but them. Conservatism in the old way—not Bronze Age old, but Reagan old—does not satisfy them. “BAPism essentially involves re-enchanting the world and giving purpose to these young guys,” the operative told me. “And for some reason we can&#39;t.”<br><br> “Do you watch <i>X-Men</i> ?” Vish Burra, a 32-year-old legislative aide to Representative George Santos of New York, asked me recently. He said BAP&#39;s followers hid out in government like mutants in the Marvel Comics universe. (The leader of the mutants, Professor Charles Xavier, can put on a special helmet and scan the world for fellow mutants.) “The movement&#39;s coagulating, connecting,” Burra said, and only at private gatherings and parties will the BAPists on Capitol Hill confess their devotion. Someday, he said, they&#39;ll go public, with a “big reveal.” But that moment will not come until the BAPists “get in position first,” Burra said. “Why would I [reveal myself] before I&#39;m in front of the control panel?”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">After the museum prank,</span> almost 20 years passed before BAP&#39;s politics emerged into the light. And just as it did, the Romanian himself shrank vampirically into the shadows. No one seems sure where he is, or how he spends his days. But a sufficiently colorful and idiosyncratic personality is its own guarantee of detection. When I heard his podcast, it took me about 10 seconds to identify him.<br><br> Costin Alamariu is in his mid-40s, and he has never publicly admitted that he is BAP. (He did not reply to requests for comment for this article.) I met him only once, two decades ago, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after a mutual friend intuited that we might enjoy each other&#39;s company. Costin appeared one night wearing a dramatic overcoat—the kind whose wearer is begging for those around him to make a comment. I resisted. He had emigrated from Romania, he said, when he was about 10. That explained the Dracula note in his voice.<br><br> We spent that evening striding around Cambridge, having what I vaguely recall as a conversation that started with philosophy and then roamed widely over history, ethnography, and literature. Notably absent from our discussion was mathematics, then Costin&#39;s undergraduate major at MIT. He had a gift for finely titrated offense—just enough to appall me but keep the conversation going. He learned that I was studying Persian, and I said the grammar was startlingly simple, because its use as a lingua franca over several centuries had shorn it of many of its complexities. “Is it like Spanish,” he asked, in a mischievous deadpan, “where every time you say a word, you feel your brain shrinking?”<br><br> For many years, we corresponded. Costin&#39;s messages arrived irregularly, and the tone ranged from friendly and inquisitive to boorish and insulting. I went to South America on assignment. He sent long messages extolling the virtues of Joseph Conrad&#39;s novel <i>Nostromo</i> , which is set there. A friend who reads books like <i>Nostromo</i> , and can talk about them, is a friend worth putting up with. When I traveled to northwestern Pakistan, he suggested that we go in on a cabin in the mountains around Chitral and “plan the freedom of the Kalash,” an Indigenous Indo-Aryan people in the surrounding valleys.<br><br> About 10 years ago, he took to calling my friends “fags” and exhorting me not to “be a faggot.” At some point he had begun bodybuilding, and he sent me a picture of himself shirtless, with the message “Do you like this pic of me.” (He had asked me to keep our messages between us, and I continue to honor that request, with the exception of offhand remarks, comments he has repeated elsewhere, and publicly available facts. He must have sent the seminude thirst pic to others, because I have not shared it, but it has surfaced on social media.)<br><br> Eventually I decided that the book recommendations and ethnographic whimsies no longer made the slurs worth enduring. I let our correspondence trail off. I wrote to him when I discovered his BAP persona, and then it was he who stopped replying to me.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">BAP&#39;s origin story</span> begins at Newton South High School, outside Boston. Newton has an outstanding public-school system, and both he and the friend who introduced us were in a clique of edgy nerds and teenage intellectuals. In philosophy, the group favored Nietzsche; in music, Rachmaninoff; in politics, none of the above. They indulged in adolescent intoxication with ideas, especially the forbidden and obscure. This kind of extremism is a privilege of youth, because if you&#39;re still just a kid, you can idolize Che Guevara or Nietzsche all you like, and (usually) no one gets hurt.<br><br> Newton also has a large Jewish population. BAP has said on Twitter that he is Jewish, and this appears to be true. Costin has relatives who were interned in Nazi concentration camps. His older brother works as a geopolitical strategist at an investment research firm and has no detectable accent. Costin has kept his Romanian accent in private life. While in character, he speaks in what I believe is an intentionally bad Russian accent.<br><br> After high school, Costin went to MIT, where his father worked in the technology-licensing office. <i>The New York Times</i> once ran a photo of Costin, wearing his overcoat with Teva sandals, to illustrate the impaired fashion sense of MIT undergraduates. Upon graduation, he briefly worked in investment banking in New York, then began a doctoral program in political science at Yale—where he was a student of Bryan Garsten&#39;s. (I teach part-time in Costin&#39;s old department, where Garsten is a friend and colleague. Costin had left New Haven by the time I arrived.)<br><br> Faculty and graduate students from that era describe him as clever and manipulative. He wrote caustic letters to the student newspaper and contributed to <i>The New Criterion</i> , a venerable right-leaning cultural journal. He disappeared for long periods. He claimed he had been living out of a van in Argentina. No one was sure what to believe. His aversion to normal human company echoed Nietzsche&#39;s: “When I am among the many I live as the many do, and I do not think as I really think; after a time it always seems as though they want to banish me from myself and rob me of my soul.” When among fellow grad students, he mocked them and played tricks. One grad student took Costin seriously, only to realize, she told me, “Oh no—I&#39;m an idiot—this guy is just fucking with me.”<br><br> One of the best ways to conceal your genocidal fascism is to write about it openly in that most unread of documents, the unpublished doctoral dissertation.<br><br> Costin was always ready to talk about political philosophy, but he objected to attempts to enlist him in mundane campus politics. Others gathered signatures to denounce dictators during the Arab Spring. He humbly suggested that if petitions did not topple Hosni Mubarak, a well-attended candlelight vigil might. Yale&#39;s grad students attempted to unionize and to pressure the university to increase stipends and benefits. One wrote to a grad-student listserv with questions about the school&#39;s dental-insurance coverage. “My cousin Benko run Benko-Magnitogorsk Dental Emporium, he make good dental work in white van at Grand Av. and East St. in parking lot outside plumbing supplies store,” Costin replied. “You forward me small price of $100 he do work … steel teeth, gold teeth anything you want.” The email was an early exercise in refitting his character to needle and ridicule liberals.<br><br> His dissertation is a peculiar document. His adviser, Steven B. Smith, is often identified with the German-born Jewish philosopher Leo Strauss, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25alter.html">about whom Smith wrote an elegant book</a> . Strauss argued that great thinkers have embedded hidden messages in their writing, and the apparent meaning of their books and essays often contradicts the recondite meaning that only discerning readers can decode. The upshot: Read carefully, because things are not what they seem.<br><br> Costin&#39;s dissertation follows Smith&#39;s and Strauss&#39;s lead. It is eccentric even within this eccentric tradition, as Costin himself allows. He reads Plato in a Straussian style: Plato&#39;s teacher, Socrates, was executed for doing philosophy in a manner vexing to the Athenian state, so naturally Plato would have learned from that experience and written so that only the most perceptive reader could discern his true, subversive beliefs. At least one of those beliefs, in Costin&#39;s reading, is a doozy. Plato, taken by most readers to scorn tyrants, is read by Costin as their covert defender. “Philosophy and tyranny are fundamentally connected,” Costin writes, and their shared aim is eugenic. They seek “the breeding,” the “biological” production of genius, nobility, and virtue: a master race.<br><br> “There is much in this view that is frightening and even abhorrent to us,” Costin writes. Yet he states that Plato&#39;s claims are validated by the history of human cultures. For evidence, he offers a bizarre mix of folklore, history, and ethnography. The development of an aristocratic class, he says, demands conquest, the vanquishing of lesser races by the organized violence of the greater. As an example, he quotes Pierre van den Berghe, an anthropologist who described Rwandan Tutsis, an archetypal aristocratic elite, as “intelligent, astute in political intrigue, born to command, refined, courageous, and cruel.” His dissertation is dripping with admiration for these martial, masculine virtues, and for their feminine counterpart of beauty. He despises, in turn, farming and manual labor, the characteristics of a slave class.<br><br> One of the best ways to conceal your genocidal fascism is to write about it openly in that most unread of documents, the unpublished doctoral dissertation. The few who noticed considered it an intellectual exercise rather than an act of incipient fascism.<br><br> Costin&#39;s advisers were not alone in failing to take his Nietzscheanism as seriously as they might have. Dustin Sebell, a former acquaintance of Costin&#39;s from that period and now a professor at Michigan State, told me that political philosophy as a whole has been one big victory parade for liberalism for several decades now. “You have a tradition of reflection that has gone on for decades largely oblivious to these radical Nietzschean critiques,” Sebell said. “When those critiques resurfaced, many professional philosophers had little to say for themselves.”<br><br> When Costin began submitting his doctoral work, Smith, his adviser, became enraged. “I was shocked that his family would escape Ceaușescu&#39;s Romania only for Costin to undermine the principles of [American] democracy,” Smith told me. “I view that as a shameful act of betrayal.” He said he made his disgust known but ultimately signed off, and Costin received his degree. “I was his dissertation adviser, not his censor.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In 2015, Emory University</span> hired Costin for a postdoctoral fellowship, on the basis of less incendiary writing samples. His time there was a disaster. He acted erratically. At one point, he refused to give Emory&#39;s human-resources department his home address. During the spring semester, the university discovered that Costin had secretly stopped teaching his classes in person and was instead attempting to teach them over email. Further investigation revealed that Costin was medically unable to teach in person, with a vague but apparently real physical infirmity. His fellowship was not renewed. Later he lived for some time in Brazil, although he has been sighted recently in Japan, Spain, Hong Kong, and Iceland.<br><br> Within two years of his departure from Emory, <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> was published—a noxious, digressive summa that incorporated the conclusions in his dissertation, and added many others too outré for any but a self-published document. It is a narcissistic, 198-page love letter to himself, or to the philosopher-as-muscleman that his BAP persona purports to be. The tone approaches at times the onanistic genius of a young Norman Mailer, but much more resentful toward the modern world. “Perversions—lame ones—are born by the thousands and haunt, like myriad cripplette midgets in halls of mirrors, they haunt the world, books, the internet. Minds are lost. If you wait any longer everything will be pounded to garbage, there will be nothing left—it will all turn, the whole world will turn to a Bulgarian rest stop lavatory,” he writes. “I declare to you, with great boldness, that I am here to save you from a great ugliness.”<br><br> The “Bronze Age” element of his perversion refers to the earliest days of ancient Greece—an era of virile pagan militarism.<br><br> The “great ugliness” is the liberal bureaucratic state. Democracy, he writes, destroys “personal freedom and initiative” by elevating an unworthy caste of subhuman creatures he calls “bugmen,” who flourish only under these debased conditions, like roaches in a pit latrine. On his podcast, BAP praises the philosopher James Burnham, who wrote that the heroic age of capitalism had passed, and that a “managerial revolution” had elevated to power bean counters and bureaucrats (think of his supposed persecutors from Emory&#39;s HR department) over noble intellects and creators. Any person of talent or intelligence is ground down by this system, by “life under the thumb of the empowered old matriarchs and the conceptual dildoes they use to clobber the heads of young men.”<br><br> The ugliness extends to art and culture. Low dominates high. Screeching popular music drowns out Rachmaninoff. “From the point of view of real culture and refinement we&#39;re as barbaric as the most obscure herd of the Khwarezm [an ancient Central Asian people] where the women scratch their pubes in public.”<br><br> The “Bronze Age” element of his perversion refers to the earliest days of ancient Greece—an era of virile pagan militarism, before the moderns, and even some of the ancients, were beguiled into weakness. Men performed feats of intellect and strength unknown today: memorization of names and poetry, running flat-out for miles under heavy armor to impale enemies. These men prospered under “life at its peak,” which happens “not in the grass hut village ruled by nutso mammies, but in the military state.”<br><br> Then things get weird. BAP fantasizes about a near-apocalyptic cleansing:<br><br> Here is my vision of the true justice, the justice of nature: the zoos opened, predators unleashed by the dozens, hundreds … four thousand hungry wolves rampaging on streets of these hive cities, elephants and bison stampeding, the buildings smashed to pieces, the cries of the human bug shearing through the streets as the lord of beasts returns. Manhattan, Moscow, Peking reduced to ruins overgrown by vines and forest, the haunt of the lynx and coyote again. The great cesspool slums, Calcutta, Nairobi, all the fetid latrines of the world covered over by mudslides, overgrown with thick jungle, this is justice. The beings fit to rule this rewilded landscape are the neo-warriors, men of greatness and violence. “The only right government is military government, and every other form is both hypocritical and destructive of true freedom,” BAP writes. He considers Japan during the late imperial period, when the emperor was a martial god, an ideal political arrangement, and has written elsewhere that it is “the perfect model of national political life and national identity.”<br><br> BAP styles his book an “exhortation,” and ultimately he exhorts white people to form military units with deep masculine bonds, and together annihilate lesser races or throw them under the yoke. One could more easily dismiss BAP as a political shock jock, and his racism as cheap and tasteless subversion, if this section were not so obviously heartfelt. He mentions by name the white mercenaries who toppled governments for profit and pleasure in the 20th century. “The coming age of barbarism will not be owned, as so many of you urban cucks fear, by the gangbangers and the unwashed hordes of the teeming cesspools of the world, but by clean-cut middle-class and working-class vets, men of military experience, who know something about how to shoot and how to organize. The fools who think oligarchs will be able to control these men for very long should look to the fortunes of the Sforzas”—the Renaissance clan that controlled, then lost, the duchy of Milan—“and many others, and remember that money is no match for force of arms combined with charm.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">I asked Vish Burra,</span> the young Hill staffer, how BAP had charmed him. “The power, the vitality, the energy,” he said. “The left has stuck itself in a position of promoting a politics of sterility.” He said he didn&#39;t agree with everything BAP said, but he loved the vision, the verve, the relentless mockery of the bugmen.<br><br> The bugmen, as Burra suggests, are terrible at countering BAP&#39;s message. Liberals and leftists are used to sitting in a blind, watching for telltale signs of their enemies&#39; racism. There is no point in yelling “racist” at someone who is already yelling racial epithets at full volume. And there is, among BAP&#39;s fans, perverse pleasure in watching their critics passionately denounce their hero, to no discernible effect.<br><br> BAPists are not supposed to talk about being BAPists, and they even have a term of abuse for those who do: <i>facefag</i> . “He wouldn&#39;t appreciate a face—” Rather than utter the word, Burra sort of gestured at it, pawing the air. “He wouldn&#39;t appreciate a guy like me, but I&#39;m a big fan.”<br><br> BAP enjoys suggesting how close his followers are to the control panels. He posts pictures of their copies of <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> next to tokens of their power, such as US-government-official passports and patches, IDs, and other items from the livery of the Secret Service, Army Rangers, Department of Homeland Security, and Air Force. He allows one to wonder whether for every Vish Burra, who proudly keeps his copy of the book on the office shelf, there are others who adopt bugman camouflage. To be part of a clandestine movement, so extreme that it feels almost invisible to one&#39;s elders, is part of the thrill. “I mentioned him in class the other day; my students were shocked that I knew who Bronze Age Pervert was,” the Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen said at a conference in April.<br><br> A BAPist can take pleasure in having entered an exclusive cognitive club. One of his supporters wrote to me that BAP&#39;s character was layered with irony, and that the ability to see the truth in BAP, and separate it from the hilarious megalomania, is a kind of Straussian test, to determine who can read and think, and who is so offended by the racism, misogyny, and anti-Semitism that he is incapacitated and unable to focus on anything else, even to criticize it. “Nobody who has the IQ to listen to one hour of BAP without tuning out actually believes he recommends becoming an autistic nudist bodybuilder.”<br><br> I am not sure I pass that test. Listening to BAP, one gets the impression of florid insanity. He digresses as if not in control of his own thoughts. He barks insults and orders at subordinates in his recording studio, and one can reasonably wonder whether these figures are comic creations or psychotic delusions. He cannot possibly believe everything he says he believes.<br><br> BAP glorifies bodybuilding and devotes much of his Twitter feed to images of half-naked white hunks in the flower of youth. Allegedly this is to worship their vitality, their fitness for the aristocratic warrior class that the modern world has dishonored. He stresses that in ancient Athens, the cultivation of physical perfection was a privilege of the elite. Only citizens could train in the gymnasium. The process of creating an ideal male form was deemed beyond the station of lesser entities, such as women and slaves.<br><br> The parade of Adonises has led many to question BAP&#39;s sexuality. Bizarrely, Costin is not the only fascist I know who has been dogged by such rumors. Richard Spencer, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/his-kampf/524505/">my chemistry-lab partner in middle school</a> , faced persistent questions about his sexuality when he was a leader of the alt‑right. (If anyone out there can explain why homoerotic fascists keep seeking my company, please let me know.) Spencer told me, more than a little exasperated, that he thought the case for BAP&#39;s homosexuality had been proved. “If I had posted even one photo of some guy&#39;s ass on Twitter, do you think there would be any question in anyone&#39;s mind?” In <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> , BAP writes that the confusion of masculine bonding for homosexuality “is misunderstanding and exaggeration promoted by the homonerds of our time,” a poverty of our imagination and lack of friendship, “because we can&#39;t conceive of such intense love between friends without some carnal or material benefit in play.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/his-kampf/524505/">From the June 2017 issue: How Richard Spencer became an icon for white supremacists</a><br><br> The sheer length of time BAP has held his pose makes one wonder whether more of it is sincere than his followers think. As a character sings in a Sam Shepard play, “I believe in my mask: The man I made up is me.” The breeding of a caste of supermen is not just a pseudo-comic reverie. It is the subject of his dissertation. The fantasies of killing “lower forms of life” are not funny at all, not even as a lampoon of liberal excess. And while some people know BAP personally, and vouch for his intelligence and wit, few have emerged to state with confidence that he&#39;s not a fascist and racist. That is because he probably is one.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">What might it</span> feel like to experience the modern world as a “great ugliness”—an inverted kingdom of sniveling ass-kissers? “Society became something approaching mass concentration camp,” BAP has said on his podcast. “I&#39;m exaggerating only a little.” His rejection of this world is matched by his rejection by it. His classmates are successful; they hold good jobs. One by one, the adolescent Nietzscheans grew up into productive citizens, and put aside childish fascinations. The person who introduced us, now decades ago, was once so close to Costin that their friends described them as sharing something almost as deep as marriage. (They did not suggest the bond was erotic.) That friend has excelled in a normal life: a job at a tech company, a family, leadership in his synagogue. At some point he chose to be normal, which means rejecting BAP.<br><br> Liberalism&#39;s victory had been so overwhelming that for generations it grew soft, unaccustomed to the hard work of defending itself. Now a ranting nudist poses a real danger.<br><br> To take a job, to toil in the modern fields among the bugs and bugmen, is the greatest betrayal. No one respectable wants anything to do with someone who tweets out messages calling for “high violence” against the “kike and nigger” scourge.<br><br> BAP has responded to this rejection with bitterness, with what Milton called “a sense of injured merit.” I find his message melancholic. Recently he posted a video of himself in Rio de Janeiro&#39;s Botanical Garden, following around a wild bird. “Yes, hello,” he says. “Do not run from me.回来。 I love you.” I do not see much space for true love in the world he has built for himself, whose components are war, purification, and mutual masculine admiration ever fearful of its eros.<br><br> Fixation on BAP&#39;s monstrous qualities has, I think, led even his fervent admirers to overlook the most unexpected aspect of his philosophy, which is a literal belief in the transmigration of souls, as described in Eastern religions and the work of Arthur Schopenhauer. If this life fails, another will come. When the ironic pose drops, when the outrageous Boratism subsides, this conviction is what remains. “I believe reincarnation is fundamentally true,” he writes, in a section of his book that does not appear to be for laughs.<br><br> “I think that is the deepest layer of his outlook,” Dustin Sebell, at Michigan State, told me. “He believes in an esoteric version of metempsychosis, that our truest selves live on after death and take on different forms. He is profoundly unwilling to accept his own mortality.”<br><br> No humans receive praise higher than what BAP lavishes on noble animals like jaguars and birds of prey. He is taken, however, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201124-yukio-mishima-the-strange-tale-of-japans-infamous-novelist">the diminutive Japanese writer Yukio Mishima</a> . In midlife, Mishima took up bodybuilding and raised a squad of erotically intertwined neo-samurai warriors. When it became clear that Japan&#39;s managerial revolution had extinguished its imperial spirit, he attempted to overthrow the Japanese government and restore the power of the emperor. After that failed, he ritually disemboweled himself.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In Michigan,</span> when<span class="smallcaps"> </span>Bryan Garsten made his comment about the seductions of illiberalism, BAP was like the ghost at the banquet, cackling from the rafters at his professor&#39;s consternation. But the remarks went on longer, and they were also searching, and self-critical. Garsten told his listeners that they—he—may have failed to cultivate students&#39; imagination. His illiberal students, Garsten said, had learned why the Greeks admired Achilles, the fiery warrior. But they neglected the Greeks&#39; admiration for Ulysses, a subtler and greater model of manhood. Ulysses&#39;s greatness emerged not from his rejection of this world, but from his mastery of its constraints. He owed myriad debts to those around him: to his men, to his son, to his wife.<br><br> The students romanticized the tyrant, while assuming that liberalism bred sloth and laziness. “Life in a liberal democracy is full of demanding moments,” Garsten said at the conference. I had the impression that he was addressing BAP apostrophically, delivering a warning he wished he had delivered in person. “As far as I have read, life under tyrants is full of lassitude, selfishness, duplicity, betrayal.”<br><br> One could feel, over the course of these discussions, the stirrings of dormant liberal passions—as if the mere invocation of BAPism, after many years ignored, had inspired a counteroffensive. Another political theorist, a former Marine and a Brookings Institution scholar named William A. Galston, piped up to remind everyone that when liberalism had come under mortal threat in the Pacific theater, “Americans as a whole found it in themselves to do something.” Specifically, his fellow Marines charged, shot, and bayoneted their way from island to island until illiberalism, in the form of Japanese fascism, begged them for mercy. “Is there really an opposition between the open society and the virtue of courage?” Galston asked.<br><br> The defeat of imperial Japan illustrated the point nicely, I thought. But it also raised a much stranger question, about how liberals acquired such a reputation for sissydom in the first place. The Battle of Iwo Jima wasn&#39;t that long ago. But in certain spaces—academia, elite journalism—liberalism&#39;s victory had been so overwhelming that for generations it grew soft, flabby, and unaccustomed to the hard work of defending itself from a vigorous challenger. As such challengers left universities and newspapers, those institutions became self-congratulatory monocultures, inhospitable even to conservatives far less nutty than BAP. By now, a ranting nudist poses a real danger—of poisoning politics, splitting apart societies, and persuading otherwise talented people to spurn the modern world&#39;s greatest achievements, which are peace, tolerance, and prosperity.<br><br> The great Straussian Allan Bloom predicted doom for liberalism when these challenges disappeared. “The most essential of our freedoms, as men and as liberal democrats, the freedom of our minds, consists in the consciousness of the fundamental alternatives,” he wrote. An unchallenged liberal democrat, he argued, ceases to want to improve, unless he confronts his enemies in their most potent forms. Those forms will shock and humble us, he wrote, and have “the added salutary effect of destroying our sense of our own worth and giving us higher aspirations.”<br><br> To Costin personally, I have never been more grateful. His last message came during the pandemic. I asked how things were looking in Brazil. “Not bad,” he reported, with laconic caginess. He had not yet veered, as he later did in his public statements about COVID-19, into outright conspiracy theory and extended roasts of Anthony Fauci. Since then, I have come to think of BAP&#39;s performances in immunological terms: a gnarly virus that had lain dormant for decades in circles of philosophers and their unread books. Now that it&#39;s loose in the human population, it is a vicious kick to the liberal immune system. And that is not entirely bad. Unchallenged, liberalism&#39;s defenses waned, and liberals forgot, temporarily, why their cause was worth defending. The antibodies are stirring.<br><br> <small><em>This article appears in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09/">September 2023</a> print edition with the headline “The Rise of Bronze Age Pervert.”</em></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/bronze-age-pervert-costin-alamariu/674762/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/bronze-age-pervert-costin-alamariu/674762/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[To Get Happier, Choose to Read This Column]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Even if you don&#39;t quite believe you have free will, you&#39;re better off acting as if you do. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/56awHqrSKyD5jEHoavVbjiGjpVY=/0x0:3000x1688/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/HowToBuildALife148/original.jpg" alt="一个人用一碗水果当大脑" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Jan Buchczik</figcaption></figure> <i data-stringify-type="italic">Want to stay current with Arthur&#39;s writing? <a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/how-to-build-a-life/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/how-to-build-a-life/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up</a> to get an email every time a new column comes out.</i><br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n 2005, the journal</span> <i>Nature</i> published a short science-fiction <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/436150a">story</a> by the writer Ted Chiang about a small toy called the “Predictor.” Roughly the size of a car&#39;s key fob, the Predictor has a button and a green light. The green light illuminates one second <i>before</i> the operator presses the button. No one can outwit it, because it works by reading the operator&#39;s predetermined behaviors before they&#39;re apparent to the operator themselves.<br><br> At first, people goof around with the device as a simple amusement. But in time, its effects on many users clearly become serious, because they realize from playing with it that free will is an illusion. As a result, a third of the population develops a pathology known as “akinetic mutism,” a kind of walking coma in which all motivation is absent from life. Some are hospitalized because they won&#39;t feed themselves. Without free will, it seems, people do not feel they are truly alive.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/generative-ai-future-training-models/674478/">Read: AI is an existential threat to itself</a><br><br> That account is fiction, but we are living in a time when science and philosophy present fresh challenges to the existence of free will. Just as Chiang&#39;s story suggests, this has profound implications for happiness. Understanding the arguments at play, and deciding how to respond, can make a big difference in your life.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he question of</span> free will arises from what philosophers call the “mind-body problem,” which asks whether the mind and the brain are the same thing or separate entities. The philosopher René Descartes famously wrestled with this conundrum in his 1641 <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i> , arguing that the mind occupies no physical space and is thus distinct from the body.<br><br> This “dualist” view has had many modern adherents, both religious and secular. For example, the Australian philosopher David Chalmers believes that the mind is not physical or material; he posits that one <i>could</i> exist physically without consciousness, like a zombie, so consciousness must exist outside the material realm.<br><br> If this is true, where does the mind reside, if not in the brain? Some might say that the mind is in the soul—or is the soul itself—which, if not physical, might exist beyond physical death. Others point to a kind of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://iep.utm.edu/panpsych/#:~:text=Panpsychism%20is%20the%20view%20that,psyche%20(soul%20or%20mind).">panpsychism</a> , or a degree of consciousness that inhabits all natural bodies. But whatever the mind is and wherever it resides, we seem to possess an essence that enables us to make <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763419300739?casa_token=QFM2udG0V5EAAAAA:KE-u5v8ZxU4vXbpNikvV30-2e8ohJ4rJ1kiN4RDtSy5vJGBq3BcisF7hu4sXQ7spSJH5Tgo4">decisions</a> in our daily lives, an expression of independent choice, of free will. A useful metaphor for this view is that the brain is the computer and the mind is the operator.<br><br> In contrast to all of this, a school of “physicalists” believes that subjective experiences and consciousness emanate entirely from the brain, and that the separateness of brain and mind is an illusion. To revert to the metaphor, no external operator exists.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C. Brooks?

But this isn&#39;t proof that the mind doesn&#39;t exist. After all, we believe that the universe is a purely physical phenomenon as well, even if we still do not fully understand it. To say that the mind is separate from the brain simply because the connections are unknown, the logic goes, doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br> This logic also explains why so many physicalists reject the concept of free will. As the Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9pqdKP9tuk">puts it</a> , “What we call &#39;free will&#39; is simply the biology that we haven&#39;t understood well enough yet.” Furthermore, these thinkers cite evidence that many of what we consider to be voluntary actions are initiated before we are even aware of them. After all, our brains contain about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/new-field-neuroscience-aims-map-connections-brain">86 billion neurons</a> , with an estimated 100 trillion links among them. The activity and connections are—pun intended—mind-bogglingly complex, far beyond the conscious control of your lumbering will. By the time you decide to eat that cookie, your brain has already initiated the action to do so.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/how-sleep-deprivation-decays-the-mind-and-body/282395/">Read: How sleep deprivation decays the mind and body</a><br><br> A hybrid argument for free will does exist, one that acknowledges both the complexity of the brain and the fact that we might not make every individual decision freely. It suggests that decisions influencing the patterns of everyday life might run automatically. So you may not, in any meaningful sense, <i>choose</i> a certain route to work every day, but you did freely choose to take a job in Tucson instead of Tacoma, limiting your overall range of commuting possibilities. More seriously, you might make moral commitments based on careful consideration, but that in turn constrains your subsequent behavioral choices, which you make automatically.<br><br> W <span class="smallcaps">e aren&#39;t going to</span> sort out the puzzle of free will here. I have my hunches about all of the theories, and you have yours, but they are just that. The question at hand is how best, allowing for this uncertainty, to act to improve your happiness. The answer, doubts notwithstanding, is to embrace the idea of your own free will over your actions and life. This is a pragmatic strategy, similar to Blaise Pascal&#39;s famous <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/">wager</a> about belief in God: You should believe, because if you are wrong, you lose little, but if you are right (and live accordingly), you have a huge amount to gain.<br><br> Social scientists have demonstrated that a belief in free will is associated with life satisfaction, as studies have shown among <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886922001210?casa_token=a9Bue08pL9QAAAAA:J39CRbQHHBh1Ypd2YLiLhvoghV3dH7TFhTtCbFVeGN7HkB4ROfDCP28wOzk--RxcGxqhiNbP">adolescents</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1948550609351600?casa_token=qAIM1G6HVusAAAAA:qsSDTydIURvpUt1dENjee_q1-Ydk6r1ZVqsTiue5eHXNn8XYevWagoUT2jEx-M1mZcyacLKPJHxnww">adults</a> .

Furthermore, this belief can affect anyone, because people whose belief in free will was found to be weaker in research studies tended to score higher than others in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167208327217?casa_token=hwirSctQpiAAAAAA:rcjxk9qfCZ21sxT-tUztGyCiZF2dCNOEvjA_Id0kqnd96pkXnAlGz8mBIN2zPTPdpYYYmGHJtHZA8A">aggression</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103112001825?casa_token=-5AUW0kHduAAAAAA:5N87zBgSW-CTktQc5RWUs5uuOR9ThLmRfaZyVHuhm5uzz9wBv15ea6DanmpWr0_jyfqcaOFIUGU">social conformity</a> , and have lower <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012001171?casa_token=mfscj-N2wrUAAAAA:NkANiMuP02lubO2EyrnmdNrFW2N5_tkrPaP3NbUbhWwv0pXtoK86A-rpSx1xrfY1d3T7Ml6MifE">self-control</a> .<br><br> Regardless of their underlying beliefs, when people are simply exposed to statements about free will, that influences their attitudes toward life. In an experiment written up in the journal <i>Philosophical Psychology</i> in 2016, scholars asked participants to read either statements affirming free will, such as “I have feelings of regret when I make bad decisions because I know that ultimately I am responsible for my actions,” or statements denying free will, such as “All behavior is determined by brain activity, which in turn is determined by a combination of environmental and genetic factors.” The researchers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09515089.2014.996285?casa_token=ZVRPiqp8fg8AAAAA%3AvIiDNbNdte0qNV9_5tFx3t3OEiHB8mmJiISGwVGNqh3_nVEXoB06ajZOD7zUB-pJyrlfQ2yqg9QNbA">found</a> that after reading the pro-free-will statements, people set more meaning-filled goals for themselves. After reading the anti-free-will statements, the participants in a parallel study perceived less meaning in their lives.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/05/financial-biological-determinism/239527/">Read: financial biological determinism</a><br><br> If you are a firm believer in free will, well … lucky you. You can try affirming this belief as you start each day by telling yourself, “This is a day of choices—to love or to hate, to give or to take, to move forward or backward in my life. I will make the better choice whenever I can.” When you feel upset or angry, remember that your feelings may happen to you, but that you can manage your reactions to those feelings.<br><br> Even if you are not so sure that free will is real, you can still benefit from acting as if it is, as the research shows. You don&#39;t have to walk around all day hoping that your environmental and genetic proclivities conspire to give you a pleasant day. On the contrary, conjuring thoughts of free will can inspire you to take control of your life in a positive way. If you are a hybrid thinker, that might mean focusing on your major goals in life, which you believe really are under your control.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he strategy I&#39;m proposing</span> turns out to be similar to the one that Ted Chiang settled on in his story. The narrator, using the same technology that the Predictor exemplifies, is communicating with readers from one year in the future. Looking at the destruction that occurs when people conclude they have no free will, he tells them, “My message to you is this: pretend that you have free will.” In sum: “The reality isn&#39;t important: what&#39;s important is your belief.”<br><br> If the mind-body problem were truly settled, I doubt that we could follow this prescription. But the problem isn&#39;t settled, so your decisions might very well be real and matter very much. In which case, my best advice is to admit that you don&#39;t know, throw up your hands in resignation, laugh at the riddle, and make positive decisions about the day ahead.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/happiness-free-will-mind-body-problem/674883/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/happiness-free-will-mind-body-problem/674883/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Bird Flu Has Never Done This Before]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Experts worry that H5N1 avian influenza is now endemic in North America. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6jYHqnitUuBFLbZvsO6hB2GZBtk=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/avian_flu_/original.jpg" alt="三名身穿危险服的护林员清理死去的鸟类，而其他护林员则在天空中飞翔" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Owen Humphreys / PA Images / Getty</figcaption></figure> At bird breeding grounds this spring and summer, the skies have been clearer and quieter, the flocks drastically <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/about-the-rspb/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/concern-grows-for-angleseys-seabird-colonies/">thinned</a> .

In the past couple of years, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2023-ongoing-avian-influenza-outbreaks-in-animals-pose-risk-to-humans">more than 100 million domestic poultry have died</a> , many of them deliberately culled; out in the wild, the deaths <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.02.539182v1">may be in the millions</a> too—the corpses have just been too inaccessible and too numerous for scientists to count. “It&#39;s been carnage,” Michelle Wille, a virologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, told me. “For many species, we are losing decades of conservation work.”<br><br> For months, experts worried most about the outbreak&#39;s magnitude—it struck so swiftly and lethally that it&#39;s become the most deadly H5N1 epidemic recorded in North America. Now the looming concern is length: when, and if, the virus will withdraw.<br><br> History would seem to be on our side, at least in North America: Earlier versions of avian flu that made it to this side of the world flamed out within a year or two, quashed by the ebb and flow of migrating hosts and by concerted poultry culls. But this new strain is stubborn, pounding the continent more or less continuously. “That has never happened before,” Vijaykrishna Dhanasekaran, a virologist at Hong Kong University, told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/02/avian-bird-flu-virus-outbreak-epidemic/673058/">Read: Eagles are falling, bears are going blind</a><br><br> The situation has grown dire enough that last month, the United States began, for the first time in history, to offer avian-flu vaccines to birds—starting with critically endangered California condors, which have lost more than 20 members of their very small population to the virus and cannot afford more, Ashleigh Blackford, US Fish and Wildlife Service&#39;s California-condor coordinator, told me. This choice is one of many grim and tacit acknowledgments that this virus is now so entrenched that it&#39;s almost certain to circulate here indefinitely.<br><br> The longer the virus lingers, the greater the chance that it will pose a different danger: permanent tenancy among mammals, a group that, historically, the virus has not easily infected and spread among. Some experts worry that the virus has now managed to establish new methods of transmission in select communities of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/health/avian-flu-mink-h5n1.html">mink</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://outbreaknewstoday.com/h5n1-avian-influenza-reported-foxes-on-finland-fur-farm-96292/">foxes</a> on fur farms, and maybe in wild seals. The chances of an outbreak among people—certainly, of another pandemic—are still, in absolute terms, low, Nídia Trovão, a virologist at the Fogarty International Center, told me. But the more new places H5N1 establishes itself for good, the more its threat to us will grow.<br><br> Scientists can&#39;t yet say <i>why</i> this particular flu virus has found such unprecedented success in North America, only that it has. In the two years since its arrival, it has infiltrated more birds and mammals—including species not previously known to be vulnerable to avian flus—than has any other pathogen of its ilk. Among the most affected creatures have been <i>wild</i> birds, a major departure from previous strains that primarily attacked poultry. And although past viruses in this family have been relatively slow to evolve, this one keeps amping up its genetic diversity by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2022-2023/h5n1-technical-report_june.htm">mixing its genome</a> with bits of other bird-borne flus—tweaks that may be helping H5N1 find even more new hosts and execute further genomic changes still.<br><br> Not all infected with H5N1 develop terrible disease—and in recent months, researchers have even spotted signs that the outbreak is on the wane. In certain parts of the US and Europe, case counts in the wild seem to be slumping. And scientists are stumbling upon gannets in Scotland carrying antibodies to the virus—and whose eyes have, in the aftermath of presumed infection, bizarrely changed color <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/about-the-rspb/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/black-eyes-in-seabirds-indicates-bird-flu-survival/">from blue to black</a> . Wendy Puryear, a virologist at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, is now searching for similar hints of immunity in gray seals.<b> </b>Should this pattern continue, there&#39;s hope that the virus, at least in this part of the world, could “just fizzle out,” Dhanasekaran said.<br><br> Wille and other researchers, though, are looking toward autumn with a degree of dread. Another surge of disease could appear then, especially as seasonal migrations return birds to their overwintering homes. Even without a fall comeback, the math is against elimination in North America, where the virus has infiltrated well over 100 species. At this point, H5N1 lingering in at least <i>some</i> creatures seems far likelier than a full and permanent retreat <i>.</i><br><br> For people, the news is still, tentatively, <i>okay</i> .<i> </i>“In its current form, the virus has very, very low transmissibility to humans,” with just a handful of cases detected, says Ian Barr, the deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. But the list of mammals catching the virus is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.8191">still growing</a> . In some of these outbreaks, the root cause is likely avian, experts told me: cats <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2022-2023/bird-flu-polish-domestic-cats.htm">eating raw poultry</a> ; raccoons, skunks, and other scavengers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/bird-flu-mammals-scientists-on-alert-mutations-rcna69541">presumably</a> snarfing the carcasses of infected birds. Other cases, though—seals at sea, foxes and mink crowded into fur farms—seem better explained by mammals catching H5N1 directly from another of their own kind. Given the sheer number of animals involved, “it&#39;s hard to fathom that each was individually exposed to an infected bird,” Louise Moncla, an avian-influenza expert at the University of Pennsylvania, told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/vaccinating-wildlife-population-disease-bird-flu/674399/">Read: We vaccinate animals more than ourselves</a><br><br> Since the virus arrived in North America, it also appears to have become deadlier, with particularly devastating effects when it infiltrates certain creatures&#39; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.02867-22">brains</a> , Richard Webby, a virologist and the director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, told me. Fox kits have been found racked with tremors; bears have gone partially blind.<br><br> To truly transform into an even worse scourge, the virus would need to shape-shift from a pathogen that primarily plagues bird guts into one that could easily infiltrate mammalian lungs. The virus has already taken at least one step toward that: Researchers sampling H5N1-infected mammals, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36688676/">including</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/12/2/168">foxes</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853945/">mink</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/8/23-0188_article">cats</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.29.501155v1.full.pdf">seals</a> , and even a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/science/bird-flu-humans.html">person</a> , have detected genetic tweaks that are helping the microbe replicate inside mammalian cells. But a boost in infective capability alone isn&#39;t enough for a large-scale outbreak, Webby said. The virus would probably need to circumvent some mammal-specific immune defenses. And it would certainly need to acquire the ability to more efficiently transmit<i> </i>between mammalian hosts via, say, an airborne route. There&#39;s not yet evidence, Webby told me, that the virus has pulled off such changes, though just a few might suffice: better binding to receptors on mammalian lung cells, a more stable structure so it could travel via aerosol.<br><br> That said, the criteria for properly mammalizing a flu virus “are not really well understood,” Moncla said. All that&#39;s certain is that the chasm between birds and mammals is not uncrossable.<br><br> No single intervention will quash H5N1&#39;s potential pandemic threat. Avian-flu vaccines <i>have</i> been developed for humans, but for now, Trovão, of the Fogarty International Center, told me, the priority is keeping the virus out of cramped, often unsanitary communities of mammals where it could rack up further mutations. Vaccinating poultry, too, would help, says Mariette Ducatez, a virologist at the National Veterinary School of Toulouse. The practice is already relatively common in countries where avian influenza is endemic, including China, Egypt, and Vietnam. This fall, France is likely to introduce shots for a subset of its domesticated birds; regulators in the US have mulled eventually doing the same.<br><br> But avian-flu vaccines can be expensive, difficult to administer, and better at tempering disease severity than blocking spread. Without vigilant monitoring, the virus could spread silently in vaccinated flocks, especially those with spotty coverage, where the microbe could be pressured to evolve in new ways. On the global market, many poultry buyers are also reluctant to import vaccinated birds.<br><br> The stakes for vaccinating wild animals are less economic but no less fraught. And although researchers believe that the recently inoculated California condors are tolerating the new shots well, other species aren&#39;t necessarily next in line. In most cases, vaccinating wild animals just isn&#39;t practical, Trovão told me. Even for the condors, which are already closely monitored by scientists and used to frequent human contact, shots are “not sustainable, really, not long term,” Samantha Gibbs, a wildlife veterinarian at US Fish and Wildlife, told me. Scientists still can&#39;t say for sure how well the vaccines will work in the birds or how long protection might last. “This was a last resort,” Gibbs said, “just an attempt to get them through this.”<br><br> But with H5N1 still raging and the birds still vulnerable, Gibbs and her team suspect that they&#39;ll have little choice but to continue vaccinating the condors on an annual basis. If this current threat doesn&#39;t force their hand, maybe the next one will. Already, another bird flu appears to have been imported from across the Atlantic—an H5N5 that&#39;s been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/canada-reports-first-h5n5-avian-flu-mammal-us-reports-more-h5n1-animals">detected</a> in North American <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/avian-influenza-bird-flu/canada-reports-first-h5n5-avian-flu-mammal-us-reports-more-h5n1-animals">raccoons</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://flutrackers.com/forum/forum/united-states/h5n1-tracking-af/975502-us-outbreaks-of-hpai-h5n5-in-wild-great-black-backed-gulls-in-ny-and-ma-and-hpai-h5n6-in-a-wild-bald-eagle-in-mn-woah-june-13-2023">gulls</a> .<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/avian-flu-vaccine-wild-bird-transmission-endemic/674903/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/avian-flu-vaccine-wild-bird-transmission-endemic/674903/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Recession Doomers Got the U.S. Economy So Wrong]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> One year ago, experts were certain that America was headed for a recession.

No, not 99.99 percent, as in the odds that you&#39;ll avoid being struck by lighting this evening. One hundred<i> </i>percent, as in the odds that you&#39;ll avoid falling into a time-bending wormhole that spits you out in 17th-century Versailles at a dinner table with Louis XIV.<br><br> Bloomberg&#39;s bot wasn&#39;t unique in its gloom, either. The Federal Reserve itself <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/business/economy/3912631-fed-projects-jobless-rate-to-reach-4-5-percent-by-end-of-2023/">projected</a> hundreds of thousands of job losses by this December. In a survey by the Philadelphia Fed that has been conducted since the late 1960s, the number of economists anticipating an imminent recession hit <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wheres-the-recession-we-were-promised-cd68a992">an all-time high</a> last year, meaning the level of expert pessimism was greater than before the stagflation crisis of the 1970s, the brutal recession of the early 1980s, and the Great Recession of 2008. Economic glumness spread to the C-suite. Last year, a KPMG <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/ceos-see-tougher-recession-kpmg">poll</a> found that nine in 10 chief executives anticipated a recession in 2023. Republicans eagerly piled on, proactively <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/survey-economists-expect-biden-recession-slowing-growth-job-losses/">blaming</a> the White House for a “Cruel Biden Recession” that all the experts seemingly claimed was inevitable.<br><br> And how&#39;d those experts do? So far, terribly. We&#39;re now in the back half of a year that was supposedly doomed, and the US economy isn&#39;t just narrowly avoiding a downturn. As the writer Noah Smith <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/if-this-is-a-bad-economy-please-tell">points out</a> , nearly everything you should want to go well in an economy is going <i>quite</i> well right now.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/us-economy-recession-interest-rates-inflation/673238/">Annie Lowrey: The reason the recession hasn&#39;t happened yet</a><br><br> Employment is high, inflation is falling, real incomes are rising, and inequality is narrowing. Superlatives abound. The official unemployment rate is near a 60-year low, and the jobless rate for Black Americans recently hit an all-time low. The US has the fastest growth rate <i>and</i> the lowest annual inflation of any G7 country. Yes, problems exist. Essentials such as housing, education, and health care are still too expensive; wages could be growing faster; and last year&#39;s inflation is still baked into today&#39;s prices. But mostly, things are good—for now.<br><br> In fairness, economists had some fine reasons to expect a rough 2023. When inflation surged to multi-decade highs, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. As economists, including Larry Summers, pointed out, deploying high rates to combat high inflation has historically been a simple recipe for a recession. The logic is straightforward. Higher interest rates increase the cost of capital, which reduces investment, which blunts hiring, which reduces wage growth, which depresses spending, and ta-da, you&#39;ve produced an economic downturn that cools prices.<br><br> But that&#39;s not how 2023 has gone at all. Instead, we seem very close to something like “immaculate disinflation”—an unusual case of falling inflation without rising unemployment. So what, exactly, might experts have gotten so wrong? How did we beat a serious case of inflation without, to date, triggering a downturn?<br><br> The first explanation is that economic prediction has always been more sorcery than science. Since the Philly Fed survey started in 1968, the majority of economists have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-think-they-can-see-recession-comingfor-a-change-11670150634?mod=article_inline">failed</a> to anticipate <i>every single</i> recession. Less than a third of economists foresaw the 1990 and 2001 downturns, and they whiffed on the 2008 crash. Economic models of the future are perhaps best understood as astrology faintly decorated with calculus equations.<br><br> The second explanation is that the US economy bravely withstood a number of shocks—and then the shocks went away. JP Morgan&#39;s Michael Cembalest <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://assets.jpmprivatebank.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/rasputin-effect.pdf">wrote</a> that the economy&#39;s resilience reminds him of Rasputin, the Russian mystic who survived poisoning, several beatings, and a few shootings. Similarly, the US economy has endured a gauntlet of pain: a wild surge in post-pandemic spending on stuff like cars and electronics, and then broken supply chains that couldn&#39;t handle all this new demand, a historic increase in resignations as the service sector came back online, a spike in energy prices after the initial invasion of Ukraine, a run on real estate that depleted inventory, and don&#39;t forget the slowdown in China and, of course, rocketing interest rates. That&#39;s a lot! The shocks came from all over: high demand, low supply, geopolitics, international shipping, Vladimir Putin&#39;s imperial mania. But eventually, the pain subsided, and the Rasputin-esque US economy is alive today because the tortuous inflation surprises have mostly dissipated.<br><br> This explanation leaves out the Federal Reserve entirely. And perhaps that&#39;s telling. One cheeky lesson of the past 15 years might be that monetary policy is weaker than most experts thought at both stimulating and depressing growth. During the 2010s, the Obama administration (constrained by Republican intransigence) leaned on the Fed and low interest rates to lift the moribund economy, but economic growth was rather putrid anyway. If the Fed wasn&#39;t strong enough then to stimulate an economy suffering from depressed demand, and isn&#39;t strong enough now to depress an economy overstimulated by high inflation, maybe we need a new theory of just how important interest rates are to overall economic health.<br><br> But as the writer Matt Yglesias <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://substack.com/app-link/post?publication_id=159185&amp;post_id=135591949&amp;utm_source=post-email-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNTc1NjEsInBvc3RfaWQiOjEzNTU5MTk0OSwiaWF0IjoxNjkwOTcwNzExLCJleHAiOjE2OTM1NjI3MTEsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xNTkxODUiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.IbM9Wi_MGubnI3j4fIA6Cywv-CMhsQV2d376dsQTLlI">points out</a> , another interpretation of the past two years gives the Fed a bit more credit. The central bank is not just a mute wizard with a joystick that raises and lowers interest rates. Central bankers talk. Their talking shapes expectations, moods, <i>vibes</i> . The chair of the Federal Reserve is the chief vibemeister of the US economy, and conceivably the combination of his statements and his actions has maneuvered the US economy into the Goldilocks zone by making Americans <i>just anxious enough</i> to throttle consumer spending and wage growth while other economic disruptions went away.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/inflation-jobs-unemployment-recession/674593/">Adam Ozimek: The simple mistake that almost triggered a recession</a><br><br> I like this idea. For the past few months, I&#39;ve been puzzling over a related mystery, which is why ordinary Americans are so convinced that the economy is terrible. In April, just as unemployment hit a 60-year low, a record-high share of the public <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/public-pessimism-on-the-economy-hits-a-new-high-cnbc-survey-shows.html">expressed</a> negative views of the economy. Now, Jeff Bezos famously said that “when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.” But Americans&#39; feelings have been factually disconnected from reality. This summer, nearly half of Americans said we were in a recession, which is just incorrect. In April, Americans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/public-pessimism-on-the-economy-hits-a-new-high-cnbc-survey-shows.html">said</a> it was the worst time to buy stocks in almost 20 years. But the S&amp;P 500 had surged 14 percent in six months leading up to April, and stocks are up another 11 percent since then.<br><br> Discounting the pessimism of tens of millions of Americans would be crass. But something important and weird is going on here. The writer Kyla Scanlon has memorably diagnosed what we&#39;re experiencing as a “vibecession,” in which people are happily contributing to a growing economy even as they externalize the vague anxiety that everything is about to fall apart. In a similar vein, I wrote an article titled <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/american-economy-negative-perception-inflation/661149/">“&#39;Everything Is Terrible, but I&#39;m Fine,&#39;”</a> noting that people in surveys keep saying they are depressed about the state of the national economy but hopeful (and even happy) about the state of their household economy.<br><br> At this point, you might be thinking, <i>Wait, what does all of this have to do with our central question?</i> Well, here&#39;s a complex and unprovable theory: Maybe the recession doomers got the economy very wrong precisely because they were so convincing. A sense of economic dusk took the edge off spending, hiring, and wage growth, and that, in turn, reduced inflation without as yet causing a full-blown recession.<br><br> So, this is my favorite theory: The vibecession prevented the real recession. In medicine, weaker versions of a virus, like the flu, inoculate people against the real thing. By analogy, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his melancholy minions essentially administered an injection of mostly safe gloom into the economic bloodstream, which seems to have triggered just the right level of macroeconomic immune response to reduce inflation without causing a downturn.<br><br> Or maybe all of these theories are true at once. Economic forecasts are genre fiction. America Rasputined its way out of the crisis years. The Fed&#39;s titrated pessimism successfully reduced inflation at the margins. And maybe the very act of writing this article guarantees that we&#39;ll have a recession at the end of this year.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 10:00:00

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2014/07/the-federal-takeover-of-state-governments/375270/">抱怨</a>巴拉克·奥巴马不恰当地胁迫州政府扩大福利——尽管这本质上并不是非法或不道德的。<br><br>但如果一个联邦机构为了获得政治或选举结果的明确目的而在官方掩护下提出虚假主张，那么这似乎就是政府武器化的一个直接例子。这正是史密斯所指控的：“2020 年 12 月下旬，被告试图利用司法部，通过代理总检察长签名的正式信件，向目标州的官员故意谎称选举舞弊，从而揭穿了被告的谎言。联邦政府的支持，并试图不当影响目标州，以用被告取代合法的[乔]拜登选举人。”<br><br>起诉书称，在此期间，一名同谋——情况表明他是时任助理司法部长杰弗里·克拉克(Jeffrey Clark)——在白宫与特朗普会面，这违反了司法部的规定。经过这些讨论，克拉克起草了一封致佐治亚州立法机构的信，他建议代理总检察长和副总检察长签署这封信，错误地指出司法部“发现了可能影响多个州选举结果的重大问题”；司法部认为已向国会提交了两组独立的有效选举人；立法机关应该召开一次特别会议来决定将进行哪项选举——显然是希望共和党领导的立法机关选出虚假的特朗普选举人名单。<br><br>史密斯没有将起诉书中的所有要点联系起来， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/leave-rest-me/619621/">但众议院 1 月 6 日委员会却做到了</a>。根据调查，其目标是不让司法部采取除这封信之外的任何其他行动。特朗普只是想让这封信制造怀疑，给共和党国会议员拒绝1月6日选举结果的借口。“别指望你会这么做，只说选举腐败+剩下的交给我，根据代理副总检察长理查德·多诺霍 (Richard Donoghue) 的笔记，特朗普这样说道。<br><br>虚假调查是特朗普最喜欢的策略。他在2019年对乌克兰进行敲诈勒索时曾试图使用这一手段，当时他明确表示，他并不关心乌克兰是否真的调查了拜登家族在当地的业务， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/all-trump-cared-about-was-announcing-investigation/602335/">只关心乌克兰<i>宣布了</i>一项他可以用于政治目的的调查</a>。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/its-all-about-the-investigation/616836/">2020 年 10 月下旬，在发生了另一个有关亨特·拜登的模糊故事后，他再次尝试了这一举动</a>。特朗普明白，实际的调查并不重要——事实上，如果调查揭穿了指控，他可能会受到伤害——但丑闻的气味可能对他有帮助。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/its-all-about-the-investigation/616836/">大卫·A·格雷厄姆：一切都与调查有关</a><br><br>多诺霍拒绝在克拉克的信上签名，并重申这些说法是错误的。但克拉克并没有松懈。他告诉他的老板，特朗普将任命他为代理司法部长，但如果他们签署这封信，他会拒绝。 1 月 3 日，特朗普向他提供了这份工作，克拉克接受了。当天晚上，多诺霍和代理司法部长杰弗里·罗森来见特朗普，并告诉他，如果克拉克被任命，司法部将面临大规模辞职。直到那时，特朗普才放弃了该计划。<br><br>这些指控尚未在法庭上得到证实，但不需要太多信心就可以接受。 <i>《华盛顿邮报》</i> 、 <i>《纽约时报》</i>和<i>《华尔街日报》</i>均<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/jeffrey-clark-justice-department-trump-coup/617818/">在 2021 年 1 月（即事件发生几周后）报道了该阴谋的基本主旨</a>。众议院 1 月 6 日委员会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/its-all-about-the-investigation/616836/">在宣誓证词中添加了更多细节</a>。 （该委员会也许更应该承担调查政府武器化的职责。）特朗普竞选团队在昨天关于起诉书的声明中甚至没有对这些指控提出异议。<br><br>正如起诉书指出的那样，这一所谓共谋的目标是“伤害、压迫、威胁和恐吓一个或多个自由行使和享有美国宪法和法律赋予他们的权利和特权的人——也就是说，投票权和投票权被计算在内。”汤姆·科尔是对的：不可否认的是，联邦政府出于政治目的滥用了权力。他只是应该更具体地说明这些虐待行为是为哪位总统和哪个政党服务的。<br><br></div>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mickryan.substack.com/p/the-state-of-the-ukraine-campaign">苏罗维金防线</a>，该防线以设计俄罗斯在乌克兰防御阵地的将军的名字命名（他现在显然受到某种形式的控制）。拘留——一名莫斯科<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66183656">官员称</a>他正在“休息”——因为他明显与叛乱分子叶夫根尼·普里戈任有牵连）。正如<i>《</i><i>堡垒》</i>高级编辑本杰明·帕克<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://plus.thebulwark.com/p/the-three-battles-raging-in-ukraine?utm_source=profile&amp;utm_medium=reader2">周一指出的</a>那样，这实际上并不是一条线，而是“一系列有时深达数英里的雷区、坦克陷阱、战壕、诱杀装置和其他防御工事的区域”，而乌克兰人缺乏西方军队通常用来克服此类障碍的侦察和火力。<br><br>尽管如此，还是出现了一些充满希望的迹象。一方面，乌克兰人发起进攻这一事实<i>本身</i>就是一个奇迹。正如我的朋友兼俄罗斯观察家尼克·格沃斯德夫（Nick Gvosdev）最近向我指出的那样，美国人倾向于认为军事冲突与动作片具有相同的叙事情节：好人一开始就踢屁股，经历了一段艰难的时期。<i>洛基</i>般的<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/06/putin-nuclear-ukraine-counteroffensive/674462/">正如我今年夏天早些时候警告的那样</a>，戏剧性的哨声吹响和战壕里的冲锋永远不会发生。<br><br>但乌克兰幸存下来，并在战场和俄罗斯首都与敌人作战。一年半多前，俄罗斯最初的计划是在几天内消灭乌克兰这个国家。相反，俄罗斯人抱怨<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/world/europe/ukraine-drone-strikes-russia.html">乌克兰无人机反复袭击</a>莫斯科市中心，而弗拉基米尔·普京总统的军队正在割让被占领土，尽管进展缓慢。<br><br>这些无人机攻击规模较小且无效——事实上，规模如此之小，以至于去年春天<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/05/what-happens-if-russia-stashes-nukes-in-belarus/674221/?utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_term=2023-05-26T22%3A12%3A59&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">我对它们的起源的第一个猜测</a>是，它们是俄罗斯的假旗行动。但它们对普京政权产生了巨大的心理影响。早在 2022 年，普京就与他的公民达成了隐含的协议：这场战争将是光荣的、短暂的，并且远离俄罗斯。<br><br>莫斯科<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66368016">最新的无人机</a>袭击了一些政府机构所在的摩天大楼。没有造成人员伤亡，但打碎了很多玻璃；显然，这也爆料了俄罗斯外交部发言人玛丽亚·扎哈罗娃(Maria Zakharova)，她<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/steven_pifer/status/1686366890099425280?s=20">将这次袭击比作9/11</a> 。扎哈罗娃比我更清楚，因为我在 9/11 事件发生几周后就在莫斯科。当时俄罗斯首都的气氛很阴沉，但对美国游客来说却充满同情。俄罗斯人知道 9/11 的严重性，普京的走狗现在援引这次袭击，既表明了他们的愤世嫉俗，也表明了他们的羞辱。毕竟，乌克兰人此时应该正在建造以普京命名的学校，而不是用深夜的爆炸来刺激克里姆林宫的神经。<br><br>乌克兰军队还<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/30/world/europe/ukraine-counteroffensive-russia.html">夺回了斯塔罗迈尔斯克村，</a>这是向南行动的一部分，这可能会危及俄罗斯的补给线。有<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/31/1189986016/russiB-ukraine-war-news">报道</a>称，扎波罗热地区的袭击正在加速，俄罗斯人在欧洲最大核电站周围的地区挖掘并埋设了地雷。 （俄罗斯人则<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/world/europe/ukraine-counteroffensive.html">声称</a>乌克兰人对扎波罗热发动了“大规模”攻击，但请记住，夸大乌克兰每次攻击的规模符合俄罗斯的利益：如果俄罗斯的防御坚守，他们就击退了攻击，但如果他们倒下了，那就是一次“大规模”攻击。）<br><br>俄罗斯绝望的另一个潜在迹象是： <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/more-wagner-fighters-move-closer-polish-border-poland-pm-says-2023-07-29/">波兰人报告说</a>，来自普里戈任瓦格纳集团的大约 100 名雇佣兵可能正在从邻国的新家接近波兰边境，这些人曾是乌克兰的有效战士，并于 6 月份差点进军莫斯科。白俄罗斯。 （波兰还<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/02/europe/poland-belarus-wagner-nato-tensions-intl/index.html">指责</a>白俄罗斯侵犯波兰领空。）<br><br>白俄罗斯总统、普京的同僚独裁者亚历山大·卢卡申科一直在<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://usun.usmission.gov/remarks-by-ambassador-linda-thomas-greenfield-at-a-virtual-new-york-foreign-press-center-briefing-on-the-u-s-presidency-of-the-un-security-council/">周一表示</a>，瓦格纳雇佣军的袭击将被美国视为“俄罗斯政府的袭击”，如果普京认为试图激怒波兰人会以某种方式如果削弱北约对乌克兰的支持，那么他仍然不明白他所造成的灾难的性质。<br><br>我并不太担心瓦格纳的波将金哑剧，我也不认为俄罗斯人真的相信他们正在经历一场新的 9/11。但我担心美国人和西方其他国家不了解乌克兰人面临的艰巨任务，乌克兰人必须夺回已变成死亡陷阱的地狱般的领土。在此关键时刻，美国及其盟国应加快援助速度。正如我的同事戴维·弗鲁姆一年多前所<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/davidfrum/status/1535794951002497030?s=20">恳求的</a>那样：“如果乌克兰可以在从温哥华到维尔纽斯的任何北约仓库中使用任何东西，那就是丑闻。清空所有库存。”<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link"

<i>《判决》</i>在我心中占有特殊的地位，因为我的工作地点就是一些关键场景的拍摄地。<br><br> 1982年初，我还是一名大学生，同时也是马萨诸塞州议会大厦的全职立法助理。<i>判决书</i>将州议会大厦兼作虚构的圣凯瑟琳拉布尔医院。导演显然想要一种破败的、大萧条时代的感觉，就像同年开始播出的 NBC 电视剧<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0083483/"><i>《圣别处》</i></a>中的圣埃利吉乌斯一样。这座拥有石墙和瓷砖地板的州议会大厦与一座灯火通明、经过消毒处理的现代化医院形成鲜明对比。 （我特别喜欢州议会大厦，因为它破旧的公共工程宏伟。）<br><br>一天早上，我下了电梯，走进了“医院病房”。我以为我们遇到了某种灾难或者煤气泄漏之类的。我发现拍摄正在进行中，但我还有工作要做，而且片场已经关闭了。我熟悉所有后面的走廊和捷径；那天晚些时候，我沿着狭窄的（很少使用的）楼梯飞奔而下，差点撞到保罗·纽曼和一些工作人员。我希望我能说我说了一些聪明的话或者握了他的手，但他们很忙，所以我道歉并继续前进。<br><br>我喜欢这部电影，因为它的波士顿氛围和纽曼令人惊叹的表演。 （他被剥夺了奥斯卡金像奖最佳男主角奖；本·<i>金斯利</i>当年凭借甘地获得了奥斯卡奖。）我特别喜欢它，因为任何经历过人生黑暗时期并以某种方式保持信仰的人都可以认同纽曼的肖像一个迷失的人回归自我——但那是另一天的故事了。<br><br> — 汤姆<br><br><i>Katherine

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/five-ways-donald-trump-tried-coup/620157/">失败的全面计划</a>。特朗普试图以他对选举舞弊的虚假指控为由，强迫共和党州议员推翻本州的选举结果。他和他的同谋策划了一个计划，提出用“欺诈选举人”来代替真正的选举人，以改变选举结果。他试图迫使司法部证实这些虚假说法，以便为推翻选举结果提供借口，然后威胁要用他的一名亲信取代司法部的领导层。他试图向当时的副总统迈克·彭斯施压，要求他利用他不存在的权力来阻止选举认证，以便推翻结果。特朗普邀请暴徒来到华盛顿特区，其错误前提是选举被窃取，人群的存在可能会改变结果，然后试图利用他在 1 月 6 日引发的骚乱造成的混乱，向参议员施压，要求他们继续举行选举。上认证。起诉书显示，当被告知夺取权力将导致“街头骚乱”时，他的顾问考虑使用军队武力镇压亲民主抗议者，让国家军队反对本国公民，因为他们反对政变。起诉书显示，特朗普的一名“同谋”对白宫副法律顾问说：“这就是为什么要制定《叛乱法》。”<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/stephen-miller-alarming-emails/602242/">坚定的政治先锋</a>可以产生超出其人数的影响力，特别是考虑到它在主流共和党圈子中的接受度越来越高。<br><br>然而，大多数保守派精英仍然保留着对民主和自治的一些哲学承诺。然而，他们一再未能通过最基本的民主公民考验，捍卫公众选择领导人的权利。右翼媒体故意助长保守派选民的错觉，认为选举被窃取<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/fox-news-dominion-lawsuit-trump/673132/">，是因为担心他们的观众会逃离</a>。共和党议员，现在包括特朗普自己的主要对手，都证实了这样一种观点，即特朗普是政治迫害的受害者，而不是参与阴谋保住自己权力的人，因为他们担心反对他的选举成本。由于自己的怯懦而动弹不得，这两个群体都无限期地受到他的奴役。<br><br><a

Serwer：福克斯新闻为什么要向观众撒谎？</a><br><br>这两个派系是保守派选民中唯一拥有道德权威的派别，可以削弱支撑特朗普的狂热忠诚度。他们的联盟之外没有人能够完成这项有说服力的工作，因为右翼在说服自己的支持者方面取得了巨大成功，让他们相信任何非保守派的人都是他们所珍视的人的死敌。<br><br>然而保守派精英缺乏利用影响力反对特朗普的勇气和意愿，这就是他仍然是美国政坛一股力量的原因。美国体系中的其他人都尽了自己的职责。特朗普持续的政治影响力完全由右翼精英承担，他们尽管渴望摆脱他，却继续为了他的野心而牺牲自己的尊严。<br><br></div>
