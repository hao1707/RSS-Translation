referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>麦克纳米/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>如果唐纳德·特朗普（看起来很可能）成为明年的共和党总统候选人，那么 2024 年的选举将是对几个关键问题的公投：美国威权主义的前景、充满活力的民主的延续、行政部门与政府之间的关系。其他两个政府部门，以及其他许多具有重大意义的部门。<br><br>这也将是一次关于特朗普是否会对其行为承担法律责任的公投。特朗普面临多起民事诉讼和至少两起刑事起诉（还有两起似乎即将到来）。如果特朗普赢得连任，几乎可以肯定这些问题都不会得到解决——至少不会以不利于他利益的方式得到解决，任何合理的制度都会承认这种可能性。这就是总统的权力。<br><br>首先来看最简单的案件：他因违反与保留机密文件有关的《间谍法》而在佛罗里达州等待起诉，以及他预计因与 1 月 6 日叛乱有关的行动而受到起诉。如果特朗普当选，这些案件都不会导致对特朗普有罪的最终判决（更不用说监禁）。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-second-term-isolationist-fascism/674791/">克里斯托弗·布朗宁：一种新型法西斯主义</a><br><br>海湖庄园文件案定于 2024 年 5 月开庭审理。尽管许多人怀疑这一审理日期会推迟（并非没有根据），但让我们姑且考虑一下审判如期进行且在 6 月某个时间进行的可能性或者 2024 年 7 月，陪审团判定特朗普有罪。毫无疑问，特朗普会对这样的判决提出上诉，同样几乎毫无疑问，主审法官艾琳·坎农(Aileen Cannon)将允许他在上诉中保持自由。<br><br>在我的职业生涯中，我处理过多起刑事上诉。即使是最简单的情况，在不到一年的时间内也没有得到解决。这就是我们上诉系统的运作方式；诉讼程序根本没有紧迫感（需要明确的是，在正常的业务过程中也不应该有紧迫感——审判已经结束，记录完整；对这些诉讼程序进行成熟和深思熟虑的审查需要时间）。结果是，特朗普对其联邦定罪的上诉（假设一项得到保证）很可能仍在第十一巡回法院悬而未决，该法院对佛罗里达州的联邦审判拥有上诉管辖权，至少到 2025 年中期——远远超过了选举和进入下一个总统任期。即使上诉能够很快结束，特朗普也不可避免地会向最高法院申请复审，这需要更多的时间。<br><br>类似的日历将适用于可能很快由华盛顿特区的特别检察官提出的 1 月 6 日相关指控，即使该审判比佛罗里达州的审判更快进行（例如，在 3 月或 4 月）明年（这是一个很大的假设，因为联邦法院必须就一项有效的审判进行谈判，并且与原定于 3 月在纽约举行的审判不冲突），向对案件拥有管辖权的华盛顿特区巡回法院提出上诉的机会从首都联邦法院到最高法院，不到 10 个月的时间几乎为零。<br><br>简而言之，在我看来，针对特朗普的任何联邦指控都不可能在 2025 年 1 月 20 日之前最终确定——根本不可能。同样可以肯定的是，特朗普任命的总检察长（无论是谁）的首要行动之一就是司法部采取行动，驳回针对总统的案件，无论案件处于悬而未决的阶段。简而言之，如果特朗普在 2024 年 11 月赢得连任，针对他的联邦案件很可能会在他就职后 24 小时内终止，而没有最终解决方案。这并不意味着这些程序毫无价值。如果特朗普在任何一次审判中被定罪，美国将受益于确定其犯罪行为的历史记录。但当我们再忍受他四年的统治，并且他继续避免任何表面上的实际责任时，这并不能让人感到安慰。<br><br>当我们转向特朗普在纽约已悬而未决的案件以及预计不久将在佐治亚州审理的另一起案件中面临的州指控时，情况变得更加复杂。根据定义（至少就宪法而言），这些州是独立的主权国家，特朗普领导下的联邦政府不能指示驳回那些针对他的案件，特朗普也不能赦免自己在州的罪行，因为他的赦免权是同样，仅限于联邦事务。因此，这些案件将会继续进行。<br><br>但天哪，他们很难得到解决。<br><br>首先，我们可以相信特朗普领导的司法部认为，现任总统至少在任职期间不受州起诉。他们的主张也有一定的道理。毕竟，如果纽约和佐治亚州地方检察官可以在特朗普任职期间对他进行审判，那么任何反对总统的州的民选官员都可能利用其权力对总统提出当地刑事指控。如何阻止一位民选共和党检察官在一个非常红色的州对乔·拜登总统提出虚假指控？<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/trump-hunter-biden-indictment-plea-deal/674543/">凯特·肖：反应揭示了特朗普与拜登的一切</a><br><br>风险超出了假设。我们已经看到当选的总检察长如何以更加政治化的方式使用他们的权力。从“合理”起诉到“不公正”起诉的飞跃主要取决于旁观者的看法。这就是为什么50多年前，水门事件特别检察官办公室在这一点上实际上站在总统一边，声称“出于联邦制的考虑，将禁止在州法院起诉他”。宪法文本中没有任何内容禁止国家起诉行政长官，但也没有授权这样做，因此这个问题从未得到明确解决。但如果特朗普当选，我们可以肯定，最高法院会做出什么决定，谁也说不准。<br><br>这也不是州检察官需要克服的唯一法律障碍。特朗普要求将纽约起诉移交给联邦法院的努力迄今已被拒绝， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/judge-us-cant-replace-trump-e-jean-carroll-slander-suit">联邦政府在一些针对他的民事诉讼中取代特朗普的努力也被</a>拒绝。然而，如果特朗普重返办公室，这些论点将具有更大的影响力。他作为联邦官员的身份以及他个人对民事诉讼的责任所造成的对政府活动的干扰将变得更加明显。特朗普任命的总检察长几乎肯定会在法庭上尽最大努力向他们施压。<br><br>其他挑战可能不那么合法，但本质上更实际。如果纽约和佐治亚州坚持他们的立场，特朗普报复的性质将仅受他的想象力的限制。例如，如果他试图从这两个州撤回联邦执法资金，会发生什么？如果他指示联邦调查局退出合作调查工作怎么办？如果在共和党领导的佐治亚州，他向州立法机构施压，要求其通过法律限制亚特兰大地方检察官的权力或要求她驳回此案，结果会怎样？国家不应该回答这些问题。<br><br>如果特朗普再次当选，他几乎肯定会避免对其犯罪行为承担责任，这只是他对法治构成的更广泛威胁的一小部分。但这是一种具有象征意义的可能性，散发着王权的气息。可悲的是，现实是显而易见的：当美国人在 2024 年参加投票时，如果特朗普是候选人，他们将不会简单地在两种政治选择之间进行选择；他们会做出选择。他们也将做出该国历史上最重要的选择之一。他们将在“没有人凌驾于法律之上”的现代信念和回到政治领导人可以不受惩罚的时代之间做出选择。我们自己的民族性格取决于我们做出的选择。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023

Goodreads]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>作者受到那些懒得阅读他们作品的人的摆布。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/DcJB2yRT39HblID42TYJ8YY2-uc=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/goodreads_final_3/original.jpg" alt="穿过书本的箭头" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>本·科特/大西洋月刊。资料来源：盖蒂</figcaption></figure>当梅根·诺兰出版她的第一部小说时，其他作家用“不祥的语气”警告她有关 Goodreads 网站的问题。这位年轻的爱尔兰作家在 2020 年冬天查看了这本书的列表，那天第一本校样到达了她家。 “除了我和出版商之外，没有人见过它，”她最近<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2023/07/goodreads-book-reviews-degrading-literary-culture">写道</a>。 “尽管如此，它已经收到了一条评论：两颗星，是由一个与我有无关紧要的个人不和的人留下的。他根本不可能读过这本书。”<br><br> Goodreads的可怕威力在出版界是公开的秘密。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/04/the-simple-reason-why-goodreads-is-so-valuable-to-amazon/274548/">亚马逊于 2013 年收购的</a>评论网站可以塑造围绕一本书或一位作者的积极和消极的对话。如今，表面上的口碑传播更多地是通过 Goodreads 或 Instagam 和 TikTok 等社交网络在网上创建的。<br><br>出版商知道这些动态的重要性，因此他们不仅向可能库存图书的独立书商，而且还向可能制作相关内容的影响者发送高级阅读副本（ARC）。 “有一种假设是，如果你收到 ARC，你就会发布有关它的信息，”文学播客<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thestackspodcast.com/about/"><em>The Stacks</em></a>的主持人 Traci Thomas 告诉我，“无论是在你的 Goodreads 上，在你的 Instagram 上，在你的 TikTok 上，告诉其他人在你的书店，或者其他什么地方。所以这就是为什么一本尚未出版的书有这么多评论的结果。”<br><br>许多图书博主都认真地在自己的帖子中添加免责声明，感谢出版商为他们提供 ARC“以换取诚实的评论”。但公开免费赠品远不是合同要求，甚至不是社会规范。因此，你无法轻易辨别哪些早期评论家真正读过这本书，哪些评论家可能会对社交媒体的讨论做出反应（或者，正如诺兰在她的案例中所怀疑的那样，是在诉诸个人恩怨）。<br><br>这很重要，因为病毒式营销活动始终针对未出版的书籍。通常会发生的情况是，Instagram 或 TikTok 上的一个有影响力的声音认为一本书“有问题”，然后该人的数十名粉丝前往 Goodreads，让作者的冒犯更加广为人知。回应这些攻击的作者可能会让情况变得更糟。凯瑟琳·黑尔（Kathleen Hale）对一位刻薄的评论者感到非常愤怒，以至于她找到了这位女士的地址，她后来<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/oct/18/am-i-being-catfished-an-author-confronts-her-number-one-online-critic">写道</a>，该网站警告她不要订婚：“在页面底部，Goodreads 发布了以下指令（如果您已登录）作为一名作者，它出现在你写的每本书的差评之后）：“我们真的，真的（真的！）认为你不应该对此评论发表评论，甚至不应该感谢审稿人。”大多数作者我知道阅读他们的 Goodreads 评论，然后独自默默地对他们感到愤怒。因为我是个怪人，所以我从自己身上获得了巨大的乐趣——抱怨越琐碎、莫名其妙越好。 “我听了有声读物，到了第三章，她在‘男性’这个词之前的停顿开始让我恼火，”我的书《<em>难相处的女人》</em>的一篇评论中写道。<br><br>当投诉越来越多、越来越严重时，就被称为“评论轰炸”或“结队”。 Goodreads 闪电战可能会破坏整个出版计划，吓坏计划讨论发行的商业读书俱乐部，甚至促使紧张的出版商削减有争议书籍的营销预算。上个月，《<em>美食、祈祷、爱情》</em>的作者伊丽莎白·吉尔伯特 (Elizabeth Gilbert) 撤回了她即将出版的小说<em>《雪林》(The Snow Forest)</em> ，原因是她透露小说以苏联为背景后遭到强烈反对。 <em>《雪森林》</em>的 Goodreads 页面指责她将俄罗斯灵魂浪漫化，该页面现已被删除。 “我会为你裁掉这份工作——他们没有，”一位评论者写道。另一位写道：“就像她在<em>这部</em>小说中的角色不知道二战事件一样，伊丽莎白·吉尔伯特本人似乎也不知道俄罗斯现在正在对乌克兰进行种族灭绝战争，因为我确信她是否知道，她会意识到这本书是多么的聋子。”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/06/elizabeth-gilbert-book-release-postponed-ukraine-war/674379/">阅读：吃饭、祈祷、迎合</a><br><br>这本书原定于明年二月出版，但在一段视频中宣布“现在不是出版这本书的时候”，吉尔伯特基本上赞同 Goodreads 的批评：“我不想给一群那些已经经历过并且正在继续遭受严重和极端伤害的人。”<br><br>现在，我不知道<em>《雪林》</em>是否让俄罗斯人的灵魂变得浪漫，或者是否会对乌克兰人造成“伤害”。和我的同事富兰克林·福尔一样，我<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/06/elizabeth-gilbert-book-release-postponed-ukraine-war/674379/">发现这些指控令人难以置信</a>。但显而易见的事实是，我们都不知道，因为——这应该是显而易见的，尽管最近的事件表明事实并非如此<em>——你不知道一本你没有读过的书里有什么</em>。你也不知道你没有看过的电影、你没有听过的专辑、或者你没有点击过的文章中有什么。这曾经很重要。现在不再这样了，因为我们生活在一个你可以通过传播头条新闻的屏幕截图和断章取义的视频剪辑来获得点赞的世界，而且营销活动规模足够大，它们本身就构成了艺术陈述。 （<em>芭比</em>，我在看着你。）<br><br>不幸的是，在这种病毒般的地狱景观中最有可能遇到麻烦的艺术作品是那些探索复杂的、煽动性主题的艺术作品，例如性、种族和身份。 Goodreads 的另一部电视剧<em>《一切都很好》</em>最近播出，这是塞西莉亚·拉贝斯 (Cecilia Rabess) 撰写的处女作，于 6 月 6 日出版。该剧的情节围绕一位年轻、进步的黑人女性，在唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 上台前爱上了一位保守的白人。选举。拉贝斯告诉我，“它显然解决了美国有关种族、阶级、政治和身份的一些避雷针问题”，因此她预计 Goodreads 和类似网站会引起强烈反响。 “但我认为人们肯定没有读过这本书。所以我不知道他们是如何得出这样的结论的——这本书没有仔细、深思熟虑或有意地处理这些主题。”<br><br>将这种描述视为作家的轻描淡写。 “如果你用它来为种族主义者开脱，那它就不是恋人的敌人，”一篇典型的一星评论<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:NBNOok5wJxMJ:https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/62919844&amp;cd=6&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk">写道</a>，引用了一个常见的浪漫小说比喻。 “有些作者不应该成为作者，这是什么鬼！？”另一个提供了。 “我还没有读过这本书，也不打算读，但读过概要后，我将其评为一星，”第三位承认。<br><br>就<em>《一切都很好》</em>而言，这种批评似乎是从 TikTok 开始的，一些著名的创作者批评了这本书。随后，愤怒的情绪蔓延到 Goodreads，那些创作者的粉丝可以在那里表达他们的不满。 “我没有也不会读这篇文章，我来自抖音，我希望销量如此糟糕，以至于书店不得不扔掉所有库存，因为它拒绝出售。任何获得 ARC 的人都应该感到羞耻，”另一条一星评论指出。<br><br>对于拉贝斯来说，这段经历是残酷的。 “作为一名艺术家，你要做好人们不会与你的作品产生共鸣的心理准备，”她说。 “但我认为，当人们认为你自己有问题，或者你自己造成伤害，或者他们用任何语言来描述它时，感觉会有所不同。感觉有点超现实。”这种强烈的反对可能在 Goodreads 上很盛行，但很快就蔓延到了更广泛的互联网上。拉贝斯是黑人，她收到了愤怒的直接信息和电子邮件，以及她发布的任何社交媒体帖子下的辱骂性评论。 “他们说我和我的孩子们的坏话。叫我<em>浣熊</em>，还有其他令人不快的辱骂。告诉我，我还不如死了好。”<br><br>愤怒是四散的。使用种族诽谤的评论者显然知道拉贝斯的种族，但她想知道其他一些在线评论家是否认为她是一名白人作家，侵犯了他们认为应该为有色人种作家保留的领域。虽然作者被明智地告知不要阅读评论——当然也不要与批评者打交道——但当批评者直接出现在你的（虚拟）面前并向你大喊他们的观点时，这就更难了。<br><br><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/164999338-the-snow-forest">阅读：正在扼杀创造力的公司</a><br><br>碰巧的是，播客特雷西·托马斯 (Traci Thomas) 也是不喜欢拉贝斯这本书的人之一——尽管是在一月份读过预印本之后。 “这是一本令人讨厌的书，”她告诉我。她反对她所认为的故事的寓意：爱征服一切，即使是特朗普的支持者。 “书中的男朋友乔什戴着一顶让美国再次伟大的帽子，就像对[女主角]说种族主义的废话。她说，<em>没关系</em>。对她来说最大的启示是她仍然可以选择爱他。我就想：好吧，酷，走吧——我要把这本书撕成碎片。”<br><br>最终，托马斯总结道：“我不知道这本书是否需要存在。”<br><br>托马斯告诉我，尽管她自己有强烈的感受，但她有时会因为自己的评论被下意识的反应和“表演性盟友”包围而感到不安，甚至是那些与她有共同政治观点的人。 “有些人刚开始从事反种族主义工作，或者支持 LGBTQ 人群，或者从事残疾人活动等等。他们觉得他们的工作就是在不了解更大历史背景的情况下指出他们注意到的事情。”为了说明这一点，她举了一个例子：想象一位作者写了一本关于黑人儿童骑三轮车的书，“然后我会看到这样的评论，‘这本书没有谈论骑自行车的黑人学龄前儿童，他们“也面临风险。”<br><br>这种动态解释了病毒式传播最开始违反直觉的一个方面：许多人似乎都针对那些在 99% 的政治观点上与批评者意见一致的作者。一种奇怪的进步性的人为优势在这里发挥作用：任何人都可以谴责安·库尔特的最新书，但指出女权主义或反种族主义书籍或黑人女性作家的小说中的缺陷，将批评家确立为占有者更高的道德层面。<br><br>这样做的最终结果是阻碍了吉尔伯特等进步作家和拉贝斯等有色人种作家的书籍。后者对<em>《一切都好》</em>的争议持哲学态度，将这种强烈反对视为她在小说中探索的政治时刻的代表——“人们感到缺乏社区和联系，只是想要一种联系的方式，一种表达的方式”或表达自己的愤怒。”<br><br>当然，如果 Goodreads 愿意，它可以在一夜之间解决评论轰炸问题。当依赖于用户生成内容的服务仅受到轻微审核时，这始终是一个有意识的决定，而且通常是冷酷的商业决定。吉尔伯特下架了她的小说后， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/01/amazon-goodreads-elizabeth-gilbert/"><em>《华盛顿邮报》</em></a>观察到，据报道为 Goodreads 支付 1.5 亿美元的亚马逊现在对维护或更新该网站兴趣不大。对流量大的网站进行重大改变可能代价高昂，并且有可能惹恼现有用户群： <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-21/reddit-blackout-previews-social-media-s-future-in-the-ai-era">Reddit</a>最近面临着版主对开发人员访问其工具方式的抗议，以及埃隆·马斯克 (Elon Musk) 在 Twitter（或者无论它现在被称为什么）的任期。有一天，我将在商学院教授一张标题为“如何失去广告商并疏远人们”的幻灯片。清除重复帐户可能会扫除一些狂热的 Goodreads 用户（他们无法忍受只分享一次自己的观点），并使该网站感觉不那么忙碌和令人兴奋。<br><br> Goodreads 发言人 Suzanne Skyvara 通过电子邮件告诉我，该网站“非常重视维护评级的真实性和完整性，并保护我们的读者和作者社区。”她补充说，Goodreads 正在努力“领先于违反我们的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/guidelines">评论</a>或<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.goodreads.com/community/guidelines">社区</a>准则的内容和帐户”，并“增加了会员向我们举报内容的方式。”<br><br>亚马逊主要网站采取了多项措施来阻止评论轰炸：来自经过验证的书籍购买者的评论被标记为这样，以增强其可信度，而星级评级是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wired.com/story/amazon-stars-ratings-calculated/">复杂算法</a>的产物，而不是简单地对所有评论进行平均。分数。 Goodreads 可以采取更严格的措施，但是，为了提高质量而减少数量并不符合公司的利益，因为它的全部吸引力都是基于草根的声音。 “Goodreads 确实需要一种机制来阻止对作家的一星攻击，”作家罗克珊·盖伊 (Roxane Gay) 在吉尔伯特六月份发表声明后<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/rgay/status/1668336078447869952?s=20">发推文说</a>。 “这削弱了他们仅存的一点信誉。”特蕾西·托马斯表示同意。她在一封电子邮件中告诉我，她希望看到“经过验证的用户或评论获得支票（或其他东西），以换取证明他们已经读过这本书。”<br><br>如果亚马逊不会投入资源来控制 Goodreads 的愤怒，那么这里的公平需要的是一个强烈的禁忌：<em>不要评论你没有读过的书</em>。我们应该像污蔑在公共交通工具上剪指甲、满嘴说话或声称你的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42880690">孔雀</a>是服务性动物一样污蔑无知的观点。我们其他人的一点自控力将使作家更容易处理煽动性的话题，因为他们知道他们只会因为他们实际做过的事情而受到批评。<br><br></div>

也遭受了大量的不满。她告诉我，她的办公室已经“充斥着投诉”（她说只是“大量的投诉”），抱怨她的选民认为人行道垃圾增加了。大多数投诉都涉及学校周围的区域：孩子们踩在其中，婴儿车在其中滚动。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/11/dog-poo-environmental-tragedy/546611/">阅读：狗屎，一场环境悲剧</a><br><br>Menin 与我分享了最近的一项研究，研究人员发现，纽约市人行道上的每 100 毫升水坑中平均含有 31,000 个粪便细菌。她说，“相比之下，公共海滩在这种水平下就会被关闭”。<br><br>虽然我从来不认为纽约市的水坑是一个干净的游泳场所，但我同意，有这么多粪便细菌四处飞溅是次优的。事实上，虽然我还没有进行民意调查，但我很乐意假设<em>大多数</em>人都希望将意外接触粪便的情况保持在最低限度。然而，这仍然是全国范围内的一个问题。纽约甚至不是狗粪便问题最严重的城市；根据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dogadvisorycouncil.com/foul-play-americas-best-and-worst-behaved-dog-owners-revealed/">2023 年</a>对 Twitter 上的投诉进行的一项调查，这一荣誉属于西雅图。<br><br>这个问题显然更多地与人类有关，而不是与狗有关，狗不能自己收拾东西，事实上，它们是完美的。但人类知道得更多。那么为什么人类似乎无法解决这个问题呢？<br><br>现在，人们应该承担清理狗朋友之后的责任，这似乎是理所当然的。这种显而易见的现象让我想起了我曾经与一位大学室友发生的争执，他声称他来访的女友留在水槽里的盘子不是他的责任。那么——那么他们是谁的责任呢？ （我仍然很生气。）但是人们会在狗之后收拾东西的期望相对较新，并且最初被许多人认为是完全荒谬的。<br><br> 1978年，纽约州通过了一项法律，规定“每个狗主人都有责任……清除他或她的狗在任何人行道、排水沟、街道或其他公共区域留下的任何粪便。”尽管所谓的“粪便铲法”从技术上讲并不是第一部此类法律（新泽西州的一个小郊区纳特利于 1971 年通过了一项法律），但它却是美国公众对狗排泄物态度转变最常被认为的一项立法。 。时任纽约市动物事务局局长的艾伦·贝克 (Alan Beck) 在 1979 年<em>《环境》</em>杂志上发表的一篇论文中简洁地解释了其影响。“当纽约发生某件事并且有效时，它就会成为世界新闻。”他写了。<br><br>我与贝克（现为印第安纳州普渡大学动物生态学教授）谈论了为使该法律通过而付出的努力。他说，当时该法律最直言不讳的支持者之一是激进组织“Children Before Dogs”的领导人 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/20/nyregion/20lee.html">弗兰·李(Fran Lee)</a> 。李特别担心<em>犬弓蛔虫</em>，这是一种有时在狗粪便中发现的蛔虫，当儿童摄入时会变得特别有害。 （儿童吃狗屎的幽灵在某种程度上是狗屎活动团体中的一个<a data-event-element="inline link"

Lehner) 在州一级通过了这项法律。该法律适用于纽约人口超过 40 万的城市（仅指纽约市和布法罗），规定未接车的人将被处以当时<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/16/nyregion/6-years-of-canine-waste-law-all-in-all-a-cleaner-new-york.html">25 美元</a>的罚款。贝克的部分工作是向居民解释法律“并不反狗”；他认为，没有垃圾的街道对狗来说更健康，并且会让养狗更容易被接受（即房东和弗兰·李类型的人）。<br><br>尽管不可能量化任何特定时刻人行道上狗排泄物的确切数量，但贝克告诉我，法律似乎很快就扭转了局面。 “在最初的几个月里，”他说，“人们开始感觉事情变得更好了，无论是真实的还是感知的。”现在，这个曾经激进的主张已成为该国大部分地区的常态。<br><br>如今，数十年的挖掘工作已经过去，但令人沮丧的是，这项任务仍然是一个需要在全市范围内开展公关活动的问题。大多数不接电话的人<em>必须</em>明白他们所做的事情是错误的。他们知道他们会给邻居留下不卫生的麻烦，如果他们在自己的社区这样做，也会给自己留下不卫生的麻烦。那么他们为什么要这么做呢？<br><br>德国社会学家马蒂亚斯·格罗斯（Matthias Gross）对这些犯罪分子背后的动机感到好奇，因此他花了 10 年的时间来<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2015/08/doctoral-feces/">跟踪他们</a>。他在一天中的不同时间在不同城市的公园里张贴，观察人们挖水和不挖水的行为，寻找规律；这些最终成为<em>《环境社会学》</em>杂志上的一份<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/23251042.2014.965402">报告</a>——《自然垃圾：犬类同伴和在公共场合不专心便便的诱惑》。<br><br> “我刚刚发现整个现象，从社会学的角度来看，非常令人着迷，”格罗斯告诉我。他发现，人们不太可能在一大早去取货，但其中一些同样不会抢购的人<em>会</em>在下午抢购。格罗斯在报告中表示，人们实际上可能并不关心保持公园清洁，而是关心被视为好公民。它让人想起公地悲剧的概念——当人们获得公共事物（在本例中是共享的社交空间）的机会时，他们往往会表现得自私。但如果每个人都自私，公共资源就会被破坏。<br><br>格罗斯写道，为了掩盖他们忽视责任的事实，许多非独家报道者假装不知道他们的狗在做什么。 （我个人多次看到过这种特殊的举动。）“我看到狗主人如何使用 iPhone 假装他们没有看到狗在做什么，”他告诉我，并补充说这些设备“非常有助于战略性地假装你不知道发生了什么事。”确实如此——在这种情况和其他情况下。<br><br>但是，当然，我们实际上无法知道这些人在想什么。格罗斯的报告主要限于观察，很大程度上是因为当他与狗主人讨论为什么他们选择不捡起狗刚刚排出的东西时，他们中的许多人对他大喊大叫。有人需要找到一种方法来进入他们的思想。<br><br> When she was a grad student, Clodagh Lyons-Bastian, now a lecturer in the department of communication at North Carolina State University, sought to be that brave soul. When a citizens advisory council she was involved with in Raleigh, North Carolina, started getting angry complaints about dogs fouling up a park where local kids played sports, she decided to look more closely at why it was happening.<br><br> In a self-reported <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chass.ncsu.edu/news/2016/05/12/the-scoop-on-dog-poop/">survey</a> of 1,000 local dog owners, more than 60 percent claimed that when they left waste behind, it was because they didn&#39;t have a bag. Other main categories were because of external circumstances such as rain, or because they were in a wooded area and thought they could just push it to the side and move on. “There wasn&#39;t really anybody who said, &#39;I just didn&#39;t do it because I don&#39;t care about my community,&#39;” Lyons-Bastian told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/11/how-dogs-make-friends-for-their-humans/417645/">Read: How dogs make friends for their humans</a><br><br> But when those same people were asked why they thought <em>others</em> left behind dog waste, they judged them far more harshly. “Have you heard of the fundamental attribution error?” Lyons-Bastian asked me. This is people&#39;s tendency to attribute their own actions to the environment or things otherwise out of their control, and others&#39; actions to their character.<br><br> The second part of Lyons-Bastian&#39;s survey focused on what might motivate respondents to pick up more frequently. She found the answer was not fines, nor was it scolding. Instead, it was employing the psychological concept of social proof, which suggests that people are influenced by the decisions of those around them: “If the people in your community and in your circle are doing something, you&#39;re much more likely to do it.” Conversely, if you think other people aren&#39;t doing something, it&#39;s easy to wonder why you&#39;re bothering to do it yourself.<br><br> Dominic Packer, a co-author of the book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-power-of-us-harnessing-our-shared-identities-to-improve-performance-increase-cooperation-and-promote-social-harmony-jay-j-van-bavel/9780316538411?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Power of Us: Harnessing Our Shared Identities to Improve Performance, Increase Cooperation, and Promote Social Harmony</em></a> , has also found this to be true. “One of the things that motivates people to comply with the norm is a sense of identity,” he said. Messaging that New Yorkers are people who pick up after their dogs—unlike the people from all of those other loser cities—might do the trick. What does <em>not</em> work, he said, is emphasizing the number of people who are behaving badly, which suggests that behaving badly is the norm. This is unfortunate news for all of those flashy press conferences.<br><br> For a city with an estimated 500,000 dogs, compliance in New York is evidently great. No matter how annoyed New Yorkers might be at the sight of stray feces, they must admit that they are not encountering it at a rate of half a million times a day. Maybe instead of a sign scolding those few dog owners who ruin it for everyone else, what would <em>really</em> be helpful is a sign that says: <span class="smallcaps">ISN&#39;T IT WONDERFUL HOW WE&#39;RE ALL PICKING UP POOP?</span><br><br> Though many attribute the perceived increase in dog waste to the pandemic, which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/07/covid-dogs-return-to-work/">appeared</a> to temporarily cause an increase in dog purchase and adoption, Julie Menin, the city councilmember, thinks the problem is, in fact, sign-related: the product of the city removing its dilapidated <span class="smallcaps">curb your dog</span> signs in 2013 and not replacing them with new ones. “The expectation was that people would clean up after their dogs” without the signs, she said. “But that just proved not to be the case.”<br><br> Menin launched a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abc7ny.com/curb-your-dog-design-contest-waste-winner/13377498/">contest</a> for residents to design a new sign, which she plans to hang up across her district. The winner was announced on June 12: a cartoon image of a doggy Statue of Liberty holding a bone and a shovel, with the slogan, <span class="smallcaps">Clean streets for all. Pick up after your pup!</span> Not as good as my sign suggestion, but still cute.<br><br> I asked whether she thought anything below 100 percent compliance would be acceptable to her complaining  constituents, and she didn&#39;t answer, instead emphasizing that “it really can&#39;t get worse than it is now.” (Unfortunately this is in direct conflict with a central law of universe: “It can always get worse.”)<br><br> I don&#39;t think that expecting cities to be completely free of dog waste is reasonable, nor do I believe that human inconsiderateness can be legislated away entirely. There will always be outliers: those without a bag, those who genuinely did not notice what their dog was doing, those with other complicating factors that we are not privy to. And there will, of course, always be assholes. The problem is intractable because humans are imperfect.<br><br> So though it&#39;s natural to focus on the poop you just stepped in, it might be healthier (and more effective) to put a greater focus on all the dog waste you never encounter in the first place. Most dog owners are out there doing their neighborly scooping, and they&#39;re just as annoyed as you are by those who aren&#39;t. Band together with those people to say, “Yes, here in [the place in which you live] we proudly clean up after our dogs … unlike that loser city Seattle!”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/07/new-york-picking-up-dog-poop/674825/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/07/new-york-picking-up-dog-poop/674825/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Moralism Is Ruining Cultural Criticism]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The left has embraced an approach long favored by the evangelical right. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/C-1ZsP8mV4LeBT1Ur9Bsv8FrqWM=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/evanCritics/original.png" alt="两个大拇指朝下的插图" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by The Atlantic.资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure> When I was growing up in a conservative evangelical community, one of the top priorities was to manage children&#39;s consumption of art. The effort was based on a fairly straightforward aesthetic theory: Every artwork has a clear message, and consuming messages that conflict with Christianity will harm one&#39;s faith. Helpfully, there was a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9CeHJXasrk">song</a> whose lyrics consisted precisely of this aesthetic theory: “Input Output.”<br><br><p> Input, output,<br> What goes in is what comes out.<br> Input, output,<br> That is what it&#39;s all about.<br> Input, output,<br> Your mind is a computer whose<br> Input, output daily you must choose.</p> The search for the “inputs” of secular artwork sometimes took a paranoid form—such as the belief in subliminal messages recorded in reverse, or in isolated frames from <i>Lion King</i> where smoke allegedly forms the word <i>sex</i> . Most often, however, the analysis was more direct. Portraying a behavior or describing a belief, unless accompanied immediately by a clear negative judgment, is an endorsement and a recommendation, and people who consume such messages will become more likely to behave and believe in that way.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/12/evangelical-christian/418236/">Read: Defining <em>evangelical</em></a><br><br> This theory underwrote the whole edifice of Christian contemporary music, which aimed to replace a particularly powerful avenue for negative messages. One of my running jokes for many years has been that all Top 40 music is effectively Christian contemporary music now; <i>American Idol</i> confirmed the hegemony of the “praise band” vocal style. More clear is the fact that all mainstream criticism—especially of film and television—is evangelical in form, if not in content. Every artwork is imagined to have a clear message; the portrayal of a given behavior or belief is an endorsement and a recommendation; consumption of artwork with a given message will directly result in the behaviors or beliefs portrayed. This is one of the few phenomena where the “both sides” cliché is true: Left-wing critics are just as likely to do this as their right-wing opponents. For every video of a right-wing provocateur like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynU-wVdesr0&amp;pp=ygUfYmVuIHNoYXBpcm8gYmFyYmllIG1vdmllIHJldmlldw%3D%3D">Ben Shapiro</a> decrying the woke excesses of <i>Barbie</i> , there is a review praising the Mattel product tie-in as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/23/barbie-review-greta-gerwig-margot-robbie-ryan-riotous-candy-coloured-feminist-fable">a feminist fable</a> .<br><br> Here, however, I am more concerned with the critical practices of my comrades on the left. Among leftist publications, <i>Jacobin</i> stands out for its reductive and moralizing cultural coverage. Addressing the other major movie of this past weekend, for instance, the critic Eileen Jones worried <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jacobin.com/2023/07/christopher-nolan-oppenheimer-film-review">in a recent column</a> , “If you&#39;re already convinced of the dangers of nuclear war, superseded only by the ongoing end-times series of rolling climate catastrophes that now seem more likely to kill us all, this film is going to lack a certain urgency.” Sadly, instead of an educational presentation on nuclear war, film audiences will instead find a biopic that takes some liberties with its subject&#39;s life and character for the sake of creating a Hollywood blockbuster. Jones <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jacobin.com/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-mattel-consumerism-feminism">finds</a> more to like in <i>Barbie</i> , despite “the familiar, toothless, you-go-girl pseudo-feminist pieties that Mattel has been monetizing for decades, alongside the nostalgic how-can-our-consumer-products-be-bad affirmations of Barbie as some sort of magic, wholesomely progressive uniter of generations of mothers and daughters.”<br><br> This trend is not limited to one publication. It is pervasive in online culture, above all on social media. For instance, over coffee on the morning after the epic <i>Barbenheimer</i> Friday, I learned some disturbing facts about <i>Oppenheimer</i> on Twitter. At least one viewer was worried that the film about the man who created the nuclear bomb did not include <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/anthonyocampo/status/1682406287555055618">any Japanese characters</a> . Indeed, it did not even directly portray his invention&#39;s horrific consequences. Surely this aesthetic choice was meant to minimize his actions by rendering his victims invisible. (An article in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2023/07/who-are-the-japanese-in-christopher-nolans-oppenheimer.html"><i>New York</i> magazine</a> drew attention to the same absence.) I also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/AlisaValdesRod1/status/1682167160364494849">learned</a> that the area surrounding <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tewawomenunited.org/2023/07/oppenheimer-and-the-other-side-of-the-story">Los Alamos was actually cleared of Indigenous and Hispanic residents</a> , another bit of history that is effectively erased by the film.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-nuclear-bomb-anxiety-nightmares/674795/">John Hendrickson: <em>Oppenheimer</em> nightmares? You&#39;re not alone.</a><br><br> Let&#39;s imagine, though, that those complaints had been anticipated and addressed. Let&#39;s imagine an entire subplot of a family going about their business in Hiroshima. We get to know and like them, to relate to them as our fellow human beings. Then, shockingly, they are incinerated by a nuclear blast. One can already hear the complaints. If the family were portrayed as too morally upstanding, it would be a dehumanizing portrayal that idealizes them as perfect victims. If they had moral flaws, the film would be subtly suggesting that they deserved their fate. And either way, the film would be attacked for offering up their suffering as a spectacle for our enjoyment. The same would go for the displaced population of Los Alamos—by portraying them as passive victims with no agency, critics would surely complain, the film would be reinscribing white authority.<br><br> Obviously leftists do not have to be as paranoid in their quest for messages supportive of the status quo as Christians playing their records backwards in the hopes of finding satanic content.  And of course we are a long way from having anything like the real-world thought police of Stalinism. During that dark era of Soviet history, writers and artists were expected to subscribe to the standards of socialist realism—which, instead of portraying the sordid and brutal reality of the present, anticipated the future reality of socialism by showing heroic workers building a utopian society. Those who fell short of those ideological expectations could expect a personal phone call from Comrade Stalin, if not worse. By contrast, it seems relatively harmless to hope that films and TV shows might reflect one&#39;s own politics and to lament when they fail to do so. Yet the very fact that the demand is so open-ended that it is impossible to imagine an artwork meeting its largely unstated and unarticulated standards shows that something has gone wrong here.<br><br> To be clear, I don&#39;t want to defend <i>Oppenheimer</i> in any way. I have not actually seen the film. Nothing anyone is saying is necessarily <i>wrong</i> ; it&#39;s just <i>not interesting</i> . Like most film and TV viewers, I read reviews because I want to decide whether or not to see a given movie or show, or else to think it through from a fresh perspective. For example, I note that <i>Oppenheimer</i> is very long—how is the pacing? Does it maintain a clear focus throughout, or does it indulge the common vice of biopics by trying to cram too much in? The type of critical literature that concerns me does not address such basic aesthetic questions, or does so only incidentally.<br><br> Even more insidiously, though, the logical goal of such very narrow standards could be to create artwork that is straightforward political propaganda. We&#39;ve seen how badly that turned out for the evangelicals (and, indeed, for the Stalinists). Even if we are unlikely to face the scourge of a Leninist equivalent to <i>VeggieTales</i> , however, this style of criticism infantilizes its audience members by assuming they are essentially ideology-processing machines—unlike the wise commentator who somehow manages to see through the deception.<br><br> Political problems cannot be solved on the aesthetic level. And it&#39;s much more likely that people are consuming politics as a kind of aesthetic performance or as a way of expressing aesthetic preferences than that they are somehow reading their politics off <i>Succession</i> , for example (“Welp, I guess rich people are good now. Better vote Republican!”). Just as the reduction of art to political propaganda leads to bad art, the aestheticization of politics leads to bad, irresponsible politics. That&#39;s because aesthetics and politics are not the same thing. They are not totally unrelated, obviously, but they are also and even primarily <i>different</i> . A political message <i>can</i> be part of an aesthetic effect, just as a political movement can benefit from an aesthetic appeal. But we get nowhere if we confuse or collapse these categories.<br><br> <small><i>This story was adapted from a post on Adam Kotsko&#39;s blog,</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://itself.blog/2023/07/22/we-are-all-evangelicals-now-a-nuclear-take/"><i>An Und Für Sich</i></a> <i>.</i></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-moralizing-reviews-social-media/674823/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-moralizing-reviews-social-media/674823/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Hidden Labor Pushing AI Along]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Search engines, ChatGPT, and other AI tools wouldn&#39;t function without an army of contractors.

Her screen flashes with Google Search results, the writings of a Google chatbot, and the outputs of other algorithms, and she has a few minutes to respond to each—judging the usefulness of the blue links she&#39;s been provided, checking the accuracy of an AI&#39;s description of a praying mantis, or deciding which of two chatbot-written birthday poems is better. She never knows what she will have to assess in advance, and for the AI-related tasks, which have formed the bulk of her work since February, she says she has little guidance and not enough time to do a thorough job.<br><br> Curtis is an AI rater. She works for the data company Appen, which is subcontracted by Google to evaluate the outputs of the tech giant&#39;s AI products and search algorithm. Countless people do similar work around the world for Google; the ChatGPT-maker, OpenAI; and other tech <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots">firms</a> . Their human feedback plays a crucial role in developing chatbots, search engines, social-media feeds, and targeted-advertising systems—the most important parts of the digital economy.<br><br> Curtis told me that the job is grueling, underpaid, and poorly defined. Whereas Google has a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://static.googleusercontent.com/media/guidelines.raterhub.com/en/searchqualityevaluatorguidelines.pdf">176-page guide</a> for search evaluations, the instructions for AI tasks are relatively sparse, she said. For every task she performs that involves rating AI outputs, she is given a few sentences or paragraphs of vague, even convoluted instructions and as little as just a few minutes to fully absorb them before the time allotted to complete the task is up. Unlike a page of Google results, chatbots promise authoritative answers—offering the final, rather than first, step of inquiry, which Curtis said makes her feel a heightened moral responsibility to assess AI responses as accurately as possible. She dreads these timed tasks for the very same reason: “It&#39;s just not humanly possible to do in the amount of time that we&#39;re given.” On Sundays, she works a full eight hours. “Those long days can really wear on you,” she said.<br><br> Armughan Ahmad, Appen&#39;s CEO, told me through a spokesperson that the company “complies with minimum wages” and is investing in improved training and benefits for its workers; a Google spokesperson said Appen is solely responsible for raters&#39; working conditions and job training. For Google to mention these people at all is notable. Despite their importance to the generative-AI boom and tech economy more generally, these workers are almost never referenced in tech companies&#39; prophecies about the ascendance of intelligent machines. AI moguls describe their products as forces akin to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/ai-gpt4-technology-analogy/673509/">electricity</a> or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt.html">nuclear fission</a> , like facts of nature waiting to be discovered, and speak of “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/elon-musks-ai-firm-xai-launches-website-2023-07-12/">maximally curious</a> ” machines that learn and grow on their own, like children. The human side of sculpting algorithms tends to be relegated to opaque descriptions of “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/">human annotations</a> ” and “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.google.com/search/howsearchworks/how-search-works/rigorous-testing/#qualityTests">quality tests</a> ,” evacuated of the time and energy powering those annotations.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/google-search-generative-experience-content-creation/674674/">Read: Google&#39;s new search tool could eat the internet alive</a><br><br> The tech industry has a history of veiling the difficult, exploitative, and sometimes dangerous work needed to clean up its platforms and programs. But as AI rapidly infiltrates our daily lives, tensions between tech companies framing their software as self-propelling and the AI raters and other people actually pushing those products along have started to surface. In 2021, Appen raters began organizing with the Alphabet Workers Union-Communications Workers of America to push for greater recognition and compensation; Curtis joined its ranks last year. At the center of the fight is a big question: In the coming era of AI, can the people doing the tech industry&#39;s grunt work ever be seen and treated not as tireless machines but simply as what they are—human?<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he technical name</span> for the use of such ratings to improve AI models is <em>reinforcement learning with human feedback</em> , or RLHF. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/research/instruction-following">OpenAI</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-safer-dialogue-agents">Google</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www-files.anthropic.com/production/images/Model-Card-Claude-2.pdf">Anthropic</a> , and other companies all use the technique. After a chatbot has processed massive amounts of text, human feedback helps fine-tune it. ChatGPT is impressive because using it feels like chatting with a human, but that pastiche does not naturally arise through ingesting data from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/">something like the entire internet</a> , an amalgam of recipes and patents and blogs and novels. Although AI programs are set up to be effective at pattern detection, they “don&#39;t have any sense of contextual understanding, no ability to parse whether AI-generated text looks more or less like what a human would have written,” Sarah Myers West, the managing director of the AI Now Institute, an independent research organization, told me. Only an actual person can make that call.<br><br> The program might write multiple recipes for chocolate cake, which a rater ranks and edits. Those evaluations and examples will inform the chatbot&#39;s statistical model of language and next-word predictions, which should make the program better at writing recipes in the style of a human, for chocolate cake and beyond. A person might check a chatbot&#39;s response for factual accuracy, rate how well it fits the prompt, or flag toxic outputs; subject experts can be particularly helpful, and they tend to be paid more.<br><br> Using human evaluations to improve algorithmic products is a fairly old practice at this point: Google and Facebook have been using them for almost a decade, if not more, to develop <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9281931">search engines</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/204798856225114?id=649869995454285">targeted ads</a> , and other products, Sasha Luccioni, an AI researcher at the machine-learning company Hugging Face, told me. The extent to which human ratings have shaped today&#39;s algorithms depends on who you ask, however. Major tech companies that design and profit from search engines, chatbots, and other algorithmic products tend to characterize the raters&#39; work as only one among many important aspects of building cutting-edge AI products. Courtenay Mencini, a Google spokesperson, told me that “ratings do not directly impact or solely train our algorithms. Rather, they&#39;re one data point … taken in aggregate with extensive internal development and testing.” OpenAI has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4">emphasized</a> that training on huge amounts of text, rather than RLHF, accounts for most of GPT-4&#39;s capabilities.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt-gpt-4/674764/">From the September 2023 issue: Does Sam Altman know what he&#39;s creating?</a><br><br> AI experts I spoke with outside these companies took a different stance. Targeted human feedback has been “the single most impactful change that made [current] AI models as good as they are,” allowing the leap from GPT-2&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20953040/openai-text-generation-ai-gpt-2-full-model-release-1-5b-parameters">half-baked</a> emails to GPT-4&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/open-ai-gpt4-chatbot-technology-power/673421/">convincing essays</a> , Luccioni said. She and others argue that tech companies intentionally downplay the importance of human feedback. Such obfuscation “sockets away some of the most unseemly elements of these technologies,” such as hateful content and misinformation that humans have to identify, Myers West told me—not to mention the conditions the people work under. Even setting aside those elements, describing the extent of human intervention would risk dispelling the magical and marketable illusion of intelligent machines—a “ <em>Wizard of Oz</em> effect,” Luccioni said.<br><br> Despite tech companies&#39; stated positions, digging into their own press statements and research papers about AI reveals that they frequently do acknowledge the value of this human labor, if in broad terms. A Google blog post promoting a new chatbot last year, for instance, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.deepmind.com/blog/building-safer-dialogue-agents">said</a> that “to create safer dialogue agents, we need to be able to learn from human feedback.” Google has similarly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blog.google/products/search/raters-experiments-improve-google-search/">described</a> human evaluations as necessary to its search engine. The company touts RLHF as “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/google-cloud-launches-new-ai-models-opens-generative-ai-studio">particularly useful</a> ” for applying its AI services to industries such as health care and finance. Two lead researchers at OpenAI similarly described human evaluations as vital to training ChatGPT in an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/03/03/1069311/inside-story-oral-history-how-chatgpt-built-openai/">interview</a> with <em>MIT Technology Review</em> . The company stated elsewhere that GPT-4 exhibited “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf">large improvements</a> ” in accuracy after RLHF training and that human feedback was crucial to fine-tuning it. Meta&#39;s most recent language model, released this week, relies on “over 1 million new human annotations,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama/">according to the company</a> .<br><br> To some extent, the significance of humans&#39; AI ratings is evident in the money pouring into them. One company that hires people to do RLHF and data annotation was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/09/sclae-ai-disruptor-50.html">valued</a> at more than $7 billion in 2021, and its CEO recently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/alexandr_wang/status/1620934510820093952?lang=en">predicted</a> that AI companies will soon spend billions of dollars on RLHF, similar to their investment in computing power. The global market for labeling data used to train these models (such as tagging an image of a cat with the label “cat”), another part of the “ghost work” powering AI, could <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/04/20/1050392/ai-industry-appen-scale-data-labels/">reach</a> nearly $14 billion by 2030, according to an estimate from April 2022, months before the ChatGPT gold rush began.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">ll of that money</span> , however, rarely seems to be reaching the actual people doing the ghostly labor. The contours of the work are starting to materialize, and the few public investigations into it are alarming: Workers in Africa are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6275995/chatgpt-facebook-african-workers-union/">paid as little as $1.50 an hour</a> to check outputs for disturbing content that has reportedly left some of them with PTSD. Some contractors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots">in the US</a> can earn only a couple of dollars above the minimum wage for repetitive, exhausting, and rudderless work. The pattern is similar to that of social-media content moderators, who can be paid a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">tenth as much as software engineers</a> to scan traumatic content for hours every day. “The poor working conditions directly impact data quality,” Krystal Kauffman, a fellow at the Distributed AI Research Institute and an organizer of raters and data labelers on Amazon Mechanical Turk, a crowdsourcing platform, told me.<br><br> Stress, low pay, minimal instructions, inconsistent tasks, and tight deadlines—the sheer volume of data needed to train AI models almost necessitates a rush job—are a recipe for human error, according to Appen raters affiliated with the Alphabet Workers Union-Communications Workers of America and multiple independent experts. Documents <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-12/google-s-ai-chatbot-is-trained-by-humans-who-say-they-re-overworked-underpaid-and-frustrated">obtained</a> by <em>Bloomberg</em> , for instance, show that AI raters at Google have as little as three minutes to complete some tasks, and that they evaluate high-stakes responses, such as how to safely dose medication. Even OpenAI has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf">written</a> , in the technical report accompanying GPT-4, that “undesired behaviors [in AI systems] can arise when instructions to labelers were underspecified” during RLHF.<br><br> Tech companies have at times responded to these issues by stating that ratings are not the only way they check accuracy, that humans doing those ratings are paid <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/features/23764584/ai-artificial-intelligence-data-notation-labor-scale-surge-remotasks-openai-chatbots">adequately</a> based on their location and afforded proper training, and that viewing traumatic materials is not a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18229714/cognizant-facebook-content-moderator-interviews-trauma-working-conditions-arizona">typical</a> experience. Mencini, the Google spokesperson, told me that Google&#39;s wages and benefits standards for contractors do not apply to raters, because they “work part-time from home, can be assigned to multiple companies&#39; accounts at a time, and do not have access to Google&#39;s systems or campuses.” In response to allegations of raters seeing offensive materials, she said that workers “select to opt into reviewing sensitive content, and can opt out freely at any time.” The companies also tend to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/14/google-ai-bard-raters-chatbot-accuracy/">shift blame</a> to their <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/6147458/facebook-africa-content-moderation-employee-treatment/">vendors</a> —Mencini, for instance, told me that “Google is simply not the employer of any Appen workers.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/07/generative-ai-human-culture-philosophy/674165/">Read: The coming humanist renaissance</a><br><br> Appen&#39;s raters told me that their working conditions do not align with various tech companies&#39; assurances—and that they hold Appen and Google responsible, because both profit from their work. Over the past year, Michelle Curtis and other raters have demanded more time to complete AI evaluations, benefits, better compensation, and the right to organize. The job&#39;s flexibility does have advantages, they told me. Curtis has been able to navigate her children&#39;s medical issues; another Appen rater I spoke with, Ed Stackhouse, said the adjustable hours afford him time to deal with a heart condition. But flexibility does not justify low pay and a lack of benefits, Shannon Wait, an organizer with the AWU-CWA, told me; there&#39;s nothing flexible about precarity.<br><br> The group made headway at the start of the year, when Curtis and her fellow raters received their first-ever raise. She now makes $14.50 an hour, up from $12.75—still below the minimum of $15 an hour that Google has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://about.google/extended-workforce/">promised</a> to its vendors, temporary staff, and contractors. The union continued raising concerns about working conditions; Stackhouse wrote a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1658489222695915522">letter</a> to Congress about these issues in May. Then, just over two weeks later, Curtis, Stackhouse, and several other raters received an email from Appen stating, “Your employment is being terminated due to business conditions.”<br><br> The AWU-CWA suspected that Appen and Google were punishing the raters for speaking out.  “The raters that were let go all had one thing in common, which was that they were vocal about working conditions or involved in organizing,” Stackhouse told me. Although Appen did suffer a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://s41256.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Appen_AR22_Interactive_v-final.pdf">drop</a> in revenue during the broader tech downturn last year, the company also had, and has, open job postings. Four weeks before the termination, Appen had sent an email offering cash incentives to work more hours and meet “a significant spike in jobs available since the beginning of year,” when the generative-AI boom was in full swing; just six days before the layoffs, Appen sent another email lauding “record-high production levels” and re-upping the bonus-pay offer. On June 14, the union filed a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-320053">complaint</a> with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that Appen and Google had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/06/14/google-ai-bard-raters-chatbot-accuracy/">retaliated</a> against raters “by terminating six employees who were engaged in protected [labor] activity.”<br><br> Less than two weeks after the complaint was filed, Appen reversed its decision to fire Curtis, Stackhouse, and the others; their positions were reinstated with back pay. Ahmad, Appen&#39;s CEO, told me in an email that his company bases “employment decisions on business requirements” and is “happy that our business needs changed and we were able to hire back the laid off contributors.” He added, “Our policy is not to discriminate against employees due to any protected labor activities,” and that “we&#39;ve been actively investing in workplace enhancements like smarter training, and improved benefits.”<br><br> Mencini, the Google spokesperson, told me that “only Appen, as the employer, determines their employees&#39; working conditions,” and that “Appen provides job training for their employees.” As with compensation and training, Mencini deflected responsibility for the treatment of organizing workers as well: “We, of course, respect the labor rights of Appen employees to join a union, but it&#39;s a matter between them and their employer, Appen.”<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">hat AI purveyors would obscure</span> the human labor undergirding their products is predictable. Much of the data that train AI models is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.noemamag.com/the-exploited-labor-behind-artificial-intelligence/">labeled by people</a> making poverty wages, many of them located in the global South. Amazon deliveries are cheap in part because <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/06/15/us/amazon-workers.html">working conditions</a> in the company&#39;s warehouses subsidize them. Social media is usable and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation">desirable</a> because of armies of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/07/25/social-media-companies-are-outsourcing-their-dirty-work-philippines-generation-workers-is-paying-price/">content moderators</a> also largely in the global South. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-cloud-computing">“Cloud” computing</a> , a cornerstone of Amazon&#39;s and Microsoft&#39;s businesses, takes place in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.blackstone.com/insights/article/greg-blank-mike-forman-on-demand-for-data-centers/">giant data centers</a> .<br><br> AI raters might be understood as an extension of that cloud, treated not as laborers with human needs so much as productive units, carbon transistors on a series of fleshly microchips—objects, not people. Yet even microchips take up space; they require not just electricity but also ventilation to keep from overheating. The Appen raters&#39; termination and reinstatement is part of “a more generalized pattern within the tech industry of engaging in very swift retaliation against workers” when they organize for better pay or against ethical concerns about the products they work on, Myers West, of the AI Now Institute, told me.<br><br> Ironically, one crucial bit of human labor that AI programs have proved unable to automate is their own training. Human subjectivity and prejudice have long migrated their way into algorithms, and those flaws mean machines may not be able to perfect themselves. Various attempts to train AI models with other AI models have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/generative-ai-future-training-models/674478/">bred further bias</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03277">worsened</a> performance, though a few have shown <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.03047.pdf">limited</a> success. “I can&#39;t imagine that we will be able to replicate [human intervention] with current AI approaches,” Hugging Face&#39;s Luccioni told me in an email; Ahmad said that “using AI to train AI can have dire consequences as it pertains to the viability and credibility of this technology.” The tech industry has so far failed to purge the ghosts haunting its many other machines and services—the people organizing on warehouse floors, walking out of corporate headquarters, unionizing overseas, and leaking classified documents. Appen&#39;s raters are proving that, even amid the generative-AI boom, humanity may not be so easily exorcized.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/ai-chatbot-human-evaluator-feedback/674805/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/ai-chatbot-human-evaluator-feedback/674805/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ascendence of Girl Culture]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> <em>Barbie</em> purports to be critical of Mattel while being enthusiastically sponsored by Mattel. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/x-xsz1KnKkOjhSGRth3GJNsRuTg=/235x0:2763x1422/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/MCDBARB_WB037/original.jpg" alt="玛格特·罗比饰演芭比娃娃的形象" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>华纳兄弟。</figcaption></figure> In the 2000s, male artists routinely excavated the popular culture of their boyhood for imaginative repurposing in their art. Michael Chabon&#39;s novel <i>The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier &amp; Clay</i> traces the lives of two men who become comic-book creators. In Jonathan Lethem&#39;s <i>The</i> <i>Fortress of Solitude</i> , two boys find a magic ring they use to take on superpowers; the title itself evokes the fictional fortress of Superman. Back then, I remember feeling that the equivalent was not possible for women artists, that the popular culture of American girlhood (horses, dolls, gymnastics) was still considered silly, juvenile—impossible to recuperate as adult art worth taking seriously.<br><br> Greta Gerwig seems at last a counterexample. Her entire career as a filmmaker has, in a sense, been a campaign to make art of girlhood materials. Her 2019 film, <i>Little Women</i> , remakes the 19th-century girlhood classic, rendering it freshly urgent for a 21st-century audience. (“I&#39;ve been angry every day of my life,” Marmee, the saintly mother of the novel, says in Gerwig&#39;s version.) Her directorial debut, <i>Lady Bird</i> (2017), captures the angst of a 17-year-old girl&#39;s coming-of-age in all its granular reality, taking seriously adolescent longing and anger.<br><br> And now here is the <i>Barbie</i> juggernaut. <i>Barbie</i> dominated the box office on its opening weekend, grossing a stunning $155 million: a post-pandemic high, and the biggest opening for any feature film directed by a woman. Grown-up art about girlhood really can be an economic and cultural powerhouse. In the past week, women I barely know and women I have known for years have texted me their excitement about the film—and then shared their response, which has been in many cases the same: They <i>loved</i> watching the film, and yet more than one felt oddly disappointed by it.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-greta-gerwig-interview/674817/">Read: Greta Gerwig&#39;s lessons from Barbie land</a><br><br> Perhaps this is because, as the critic Dana Stevens <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/culture/2023/07/barbie-movie-2023-margot-robbie-ryan-gosling-review.html">noted in <i>Slate</i></a> , <i>Barbie</i> “never completely resolves the paradox at its heart”: The movie purports to be critical of Mattel while being enthusiastically sponsored by Mattel. The constraint is so obvious that Gerwig tries to turn it into a joke. The plot hinges on the conceit that all the Barbies mistakenly believe that their existence has turned the “real” world into a feminist paradise. But Gerwig knows that no one wants to watch a hectoring film about how the doll is bad for girls&#39; self-image. So she subversively jokes about the insidious side of corporate culture while visually celebrating the Barbieness of Barbie. In this way, <i>Barbie</i> really is, if not a wholly successful film, certainly a powerful monument to the strangeness of American girl culture, which remains impoverished in its vision of what young girls are and want.<br><br> At once a commercial for a toy and a delicious romp through the pleasures of childhood play, <i>Barbie</i> sits uneasily at the intersection of reality, fantasy, and critique. It is joyous, winking, frothily cinematic. There are lavish costumes, deftly choreographed dance numbers, and aesthetically sophisticated visual puns. Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, is wryly known as “Stereotypical Barbie”; blond and perfect, she showers and drinks without ever getting wet, walks on her toes, floats down from her bedroom to the street as if held by an invisible girl&#39;s hand. The script is peppered with genuinely incisive and funny skewers of gender stereotypes. A key moment in the plot involves the Barbies allowing the Kens to “sing at them” while playing guitars; the preposition is pure genius.<br><br> Like many women before it, <i>Barbie</i> tries to be many things to many people. One trailer&#39;s tag line was “If you love Barbie, this movie is for you. If you hate Barbie, this movie is for you.” The line gets at the challenge here, adjacent to the one Stevens identified: How do you make a film for an audience that remains fiercely divided about the material you&#39;re writing about?<br><br> This conflict, one might say, is precisely what forces Stereotypical Barbie out of her dreamy pink home on a quest to understand a series of strange phenomena: cellulite, cold showers, melancholy. We meet Barbie in Barbie Land, where women rule, literally. There is a Barbie president; there are nine Supreme Court Barbies. Kens are reduced to supporting roles. They wait for Barbies to kiss them, notice them, long for them. But when Barbie begins having relentless thoughts of death, she and one of the Kens, played to deliciously banal perfection by Ryan Gosling, enter “reality.” It isn&#39;t the paradise she expected; men ogle her and a girl calls her a “fascist.” As reality&#39;s reality dawns on Barbie, she articulates a set of feelings at once amusingly framed and horrifying to witness: “I feel … ill at ease,” she says. “I&#39;m getting undertones of violence.” (Cue women squirming in the audience.) Meanwhile, Ken is radicalized by his experience: He likes the attention he gets. He sees a new world, one where men are not second-class citizens, and returns to Barbie Land to brainwash the Barbies into serving the Kens. The former Supreme Court justices are now cheerleaders.<br><br> Rather than get angry at what has happened to Barbie Land, Barbie is crushed. She stops wearing makeup and lies on the floor in despair, waiting for another Barbie to take the lead in fixing her society. And so the second half of the film tells the somewhat incoherent story of her evolution from thinking she is not “good enough” to becoming a woman bent on self-determination. In the real world, she befriends a real woman named Gloria (America Ferrara), who delivers an impassioned motivational speech about how hard it is to be a woman in a world that demands contradictory things: to care tirelessly for your children but not talk about them too much; to act when action seems fruitless.<br><br> The challenge that Barbie, as a cultural object, presents Gerwig is how to mine the performative pleasures of clothes and dance numbers alongside the travesties of modern American culture while framing the story as if the two are wholly disconnected. She&#39;s trying to show what it might really be like to go from a dream land to contemporary America, where <i>Roe v. Wade</i> has been overturned, parents still don&#39;t automatically get parental leave after the birth of a child, and most CEOs of corporations (including Mattel) are still men.<br><br> <i>Barbie</i> is at once radical and conventional. It is radical in its light indictment of the patriarchy: One of the very best lines of cultural criticism I&#39;ve heard in ages comes when Ken says, “To be honest, when I found out the patriarchy wasn&#39;t about horses I lost interest.” (The movie might be best read as a brilliant portrait of aggrieved far-right masculinity.) It is somewhat more conventional in its vision of a dream girlhood and its idea of what Barbie <i>is</i> . And perhaps here is where Mattel&#39;s influence is strongest. Despite the presence of Doctor Barbies and Supreme Court Barbies, Gerwig&#39;s Barbies still largely conform to rigid beauty norms; a night of fun is a dance number in glittery and sexy clothes; and no conflict ever occurs, because the days are coated in a vapid gloss of fashion and pink plastic that corporate America has always been selling girls. This is the vision that led my second-wave-feminist mother to ban Barbie from our house. When my aunt gave me two for my fifth birthday, they mysteriously disappeared a few days later.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">Read: The surprising key to understanding the Barbie film</a><br><br> To some degree, this vapidity is Gerwig&#39;s point: Barbie must leave Barbie Land, as all girls must, to confront a messier and more complex reality. And yet <i>Barbie</i> skirts the deep cognitive dissonance the doll inspires in many girls. Thanks to my mother&#39;s ban, I played with Barbie only at friends&#39; houses. I recall finding the doll boring, because she was relentlessly tethered to <i>our</i> world and to the culture&#39;s expectations for adult me, ones that didn&#39;t yet interest me (boys, houses, Malibu). Instead of playing Barbie, my friends and I disfigured her so she looked like the film&#39;s Weird Barbie (Kate MacKinnon), a doll with a 1980s punk haircut who&#39;s out of step with all the others. Like the montage in the film showing what a girl did to Weird Barbie, we chopped off her hair down to chunky sprouts, turned her head backward, covered her face in green marker. In the film&#39;s lingo, Weird Barbie is weird because girls have “played too hard” with her, a telling evasion. Weird Barbie is not weird because someone played too hard with her. Weird Barbie is weird, as Gerwig surely knows, because some girl used her to express all her frustration at the confection of materialism and reductive beauty norms. Weird Barbie wants to raze Barbie Land, not just help Stereotypical Barbie see reality for what it is.<br><br> <i>Barbie</i> is a fascinating moment in the ascendance of girl culture, a brilliantly twisty dive into the core of the contradictory scripts shaping what it is like to grow up as a girl in America. One of those scripts teaches that girlhood isn&#39;t a space of imaginative autonomy but a kind of prep school for a conventional consumer adulthood that will be shaped by hair appointments, shopping, and a job. Despite the constraints she faces, Gerwig tries to invoke a more capacious script for girlhood at the film&#39;s end, in a beautiful montage of girls playing around the world, in muted visuals that starkly contrast with the Technicolor Barbie world. If the film emerges aesthetically scathed, that doesn&#39;t mean it is a failure. I left delighted by how much Gerwig had achieved through humor, and by the conviction that <i>Barbie</i> can only help make room for more films by women about women. The film&#39;s tag line is right. One can hate Barbie and still be glad this movie was made, because here it is at last: a movie full of jokes for us, the women and girls in the room. In that sense, nothing about <i>Barbie</i> is silly or juvenile.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-girlhood-greta-gerwig/674821/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-girlhood-greta-gerwig/674821/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Elite-College Admissions Matter]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A conversation with Annie Lowrey about how to diversify these schools—and by extension, America&#39;s elite <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6uJxUOZ3NbpIGfYTL90DBaP8PEY=/127x0:2259x1199/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/image_3/original.png" alt="大学校园" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> ccahill / Getty</figcaption></figure><small><i>这是</i>《大西洋<i>日报》的一个版本，是一份时事通讯，可引导您了解当天最大的故事，帮助您发现新想法，并推荐最好的文化。</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/"><i>在这里注册。</i></a></small><br><br> Attendance at an elite college increases a student&#39;s chances of joining America&#39;s most elite ranks, according to a new study.

Over the past two decades, a body of research has shown that students&#39; average incomes end up about the same after they graduate from a flagship public institution versus an Ivy Plus school. The new study <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf#page=4">confirms this finding</a> about average incomes, but it complicates the bigger picture: When it comes to other metrics of life in the American elite—“Supreme Court clerkships, going to a tippy-top graduate program, making it into the top 1 percent of earners at the age of 33”—schools such as Harvard and Yale matter a lot. “In general, [elite schools have] this propulsive quality,” Annie told me.<br><br> White students and, to an even greater extent, wealthy students are overrepresented at many elite colleges, and the question of how these schools can diversify has become even more urgent since the Supreme Court&#39;s decision to curtail affirmative action. But this new study suggests that elite schools can enact some straightforward policies to diversify themselves and, in the process, the makeup of elite America. Annie and I talked through two of these possibilities.<br><br> <b>Disbanding legacy admissions:</b> Systems that give preference to the children of university alumni have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bowman.house.gov/2022/2/news-rep-jamaal-bowman-sen-jeff-merkley-introduce-legacy-admissions-reform-bill">come under scrutiny</a> in recent years, and this scrutiny has intensified since last month&#39;s Supreme Court ruling. Today, the Education Department said <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/us/politics/harvard-admissions-civil-rights-inquiry.html">it has opened</a> a civil-rights investigation into Harvard&#39;s legacy-admissions practices. And last week, Wesleyan University (my own alma mater) declared an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4105550-wesleyan-university-ending-legacy-admissions-after-supreme-court-ruling/">end</a> to its use of legacy preferences.<br><br><p role="presentation"> The new paper from Chetty and his co-authors confirms that the effects of legacy admissions are real, and that they&#39;re particularly strong for the highest-income students. The data show that legacy students whose parents are in the top 1 percent of the earnings distribution are 5 times more likely to be admitted to an Ivy Plus school compared with non-legacy students with equivalent test scores. Meanwhile, less wealthy legacy students are 3 times more likely to be admitted.</p> When I asked Annie if she thought the decline of legacy admissions at elite schools is a real possibility (MIT is the only school out of the Ivy Plus group studied that doesn&#39;t use legacy preferences), she noted that this is quickly becoming a public-policy issue: President Joe Biden <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/29/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-decision-on-affirmative-action/#:~:text=We%20can%20and%20must%20do,expand%20privilege%20instead%20of%20opportunity.">came out against</a> the practice after the Supreme Court ruling, and according to polling, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/04/26/u-s-public-continues-to-view-grades-test-scores-as-top-factors-in-college-admissions/">about three-quarters</a> of Americans think colleges shouldn&#39;t use legacy preferences. Universities might start to rethink their use of the practice if their presidents start getting asked about it over and over again, Annie said, “and if you start to have members of Congress saying, &#39;Do we need to be giving these institutions all of this research funding and all of these nice tax breaks if they&#39;re just picking rich kids and giving them more advantage?&#39;”<br><br> President Biden is a particularly interesting political figure for this moment: As Annie reminded me, Biden was purportedly not a very good student, and he did not attend an elite college, as many past presidents did (he went to the University of Delaware). Meanwhile, many members of Congress come from elite colleges themselves, Annie noted: “The thing that will be most interesting is if this becomes political, and for whom does it become political?”<br><br><p role="presentation"> <b>Increasing class sizes:</b> I asked Annie to elaborate on a surprisingly simple argument she makes at the end of her article, one that isn&#39;t explicitly covered in the Chetty research: Elite schools might just matriculate more students. “These schools have not grown with the growth of the United States population or the population of 18-year-olds,” she told me. We pulled up the statistics together over the phone: These Ivy Plus schools graduate about 23,000 students a year combined. Meanwhile, there are about 4 million 18-year-olds in America in any given year. Of course, not all of those kids are going to go to college. But 23,000 is “a drop in the bucket,” Annie said.</p><p role="presentation"> These schools have tremendous financial resources—a combined endowment of more than $200 billion for those Ivy Plus schools. Moreover, many of these schools spend lavishly on what are essentially “real-estate concerns,” such as sports facilities and dining halls, Annie said: “The notion that they couldn&#39;t be educating many, many, many more kids is risible.”</p><p role="presentation"> <b>Related:</b></p><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">为什么你要关心这12所大学</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/affirmative-action-supreme-court-college-admissions-essays-trauma/674314/">A big problem with college admissions could be about to get worse.</a></li><strong>今日新闻</strong><br><br><li>The International Brotherhood of Teamsters has called off <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/25/1189956641/ups-union-calls-off-strike-threat-after-securing-pay-raises-for-workers">a nationwide strike</a> threat after securing a tentative five-year agreement with UPS leadership.</li><li> Qin Gang <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/25/china/china-foreign-minister-qin-gang-replaced-wang-yi-intl-hnk/index.html">was ousted</a> from his role as China&#39;s foreign minister after a month-long absence from public view.

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>马里奥·塔玛/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>好莱坞的记忆力一直很差。行业分析师将在数月内预测电影未来的厄运，然后在新上映的影片超出预期时欢欣鼓舞。今年夏天也不例外： <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/06/the-flash-production-issues-muschietti/674334/"><em>《闪电侠》</em></a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/06/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-review/674509/"><em>《夺宝奇兵》</em></a>等几部大片表现不佳， <a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/disney-box-office-failures-indiana-jones-elemental-ant-man-1235660409/">很快就陷入了</a>绝望。但上周末带来了巨大的转变，这要归功于<em>《巴本海默》</em> ——格蕾塔·葛韦格饰演的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/"><em>芭比娃娃</em></a>和克里斯托弗·诺兰饰演的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/"><em>奥本海默</em></a>的正面交锋。这两部电影是完全不同的、由导演主导的作品，它们使各自的预期票房翻了一番，并共同推动了历史上第四高的首周末票房。夏天可以拯救了！然而，随着演员和编剧的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywoods-cruel-strategy/674730/">罢工</a>持续不断，制片厂似乎几乎一心要粉碎任何真正的行业发展势头的机会。<br><br>让<em>芭比</em>与<em>奥本海默</em>对抗的策略最初似乎很冒险。但葛韦格的亮粉色名牌喜剧与诺兰的 R 级三小时传记史诗之间的差异也引发了炒作。最终， <em>《芭比娃娃》</em>的首映票房为 1.62 亿美元， <em>《奥本海默》</em>的首映票房为 8200 万美元——前者创下了女性导演电影的票房纪录，而诺兰则获得了非蝙蝠侠电影史上最高的周末票房收入。<br><br>在经历了几个月商业上平淡无奇的续集之后，这对电影业来说是一个巨大的、令人振奋的成功。最重要的是，这清楚地表明观众渴望优质产品。大片并没有过时，但电影公司不能仅仅依赖最新的系列作品；一些老牌公司（例如 DC 漫画和<em>速度与激情</em>）开始失去光彩。<em>芭比</em>和<em>奥本海默</em>通过获得积极评价和提供真正引人注目的东西赢得了观众的热情：<em>芭比</em>在人群中非常有趣和快乐；<em>奥本海默的</em>视觉效果令人惊叹，并在 IMAX 等大型优质银幕上提升了其销量。这两部电影都获得了 A 级 CinemaScore，这是口碑的良好指标，因此整个 8 月份的票房应该会保持健康。<br><br>尽管如此，麻烦即将来临，第一个例子也出现在上周末。由<em>赞</em>达亚主演的浪漫网球喜剧《挑战者》 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/zendaya-challengers-actors-strike-release-date-1235444723/">将上映日期</a>从 9 月 15 日改为明年 4 月 26 日，取消了原定在威尼斯电影节上映的计划。这部电影由卢卡·瓜达格尼诺（《<em>请以你的名字呼唤我</em>》）执导，本来打算在米高梅的影院大肆宣传，但演员工会罢工意味着赞达亚和她的联合主演可能无法宣传这部电影，这会给依赖明星力量的项目带来困难。<br><br>其他几个项目也因为罢工而被推迟，包括 A24 的独立喜剧<em>《Problemista》</em> 、狮门影业的励志剧<em>《白鸟》</em>和<em>《辣身舞》</em>续集。但接下来真正的多米诺骨牌可能会倒下，有<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/dune-2-release-date-change-2024-warner-bros-strike-1235676007/">传言</a>称华纳兄弟可能会将其即将上映的大片<em>——《沙丘第二部》</em> 、 <em>《紫色》</em>和<em>《海王与失落的王国</em>》——从 2023 年的日历中剔除。计划于秋季上映的其他大片包括马丁·斯科塞斯的<em>《花月杀手》</em> 、超级英雄电影<em>《奇迹》</em>和《<em>饥饿游戏》</em>前传，所有这些都需要明星在新闻发布会上来推动其销售。 （<em>芭比</em>和<em>奥本海默</em>的演员们在罢工之前接受了许多媒体采访。）<br><br>危机不仅正在酝酿，而且还在酝酿之中。它在这里。电影制片厂不与美国演员工会和美国作家协会恢复谈判的每一天都会危及好莱坞的未来。新冠疫情造成的连年延误加剧了人们对电影的生存焦虑：更多的电影被分发到流媒体服务，观众也习惯了在家观看新上映的电影。现在人们又可以放心地去看电影了，<em>巴本海默</em>现象正在提醒各个年龄段的观众，大银幕体验的价值。不利用这种能量将是一个灾难性的错误。<br><br>然而，这似乎是电影和电视制片人联盟（代表主要制片厂的松散贸易协会）愿意犯的错误。 WGA 已经罢工 84 天，没有迹象表明短期内会恢复谈判。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/writers-strike-hollywood-studios-deal-fight-wga-actors-1235434335/"><em>Deadline 的</em>一篇文章</a>援引一位匿名“顶级制片人”的话说，制片厂将允许僵局至少持续到十月。 AMPTP 予以反击，声称其“致力于达成协议”。不管怎样，这篇报道强调了 WGA 和制片厂之间的关系已经变得多么有害。残差、生成人工智能的使用以及流数据的共享都是重要的分歧点。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywoods-cruel-strategy/674730/">阅读：商人打破了好莱坞</a><br><br>多年来，娱乐业经历了多次 WGA 罢工，但 SAG 的行动更令人惊讶，并且立即产生了影响，基本上关闭了所有主要电影制作并影响了未来的上映时间表。许多相同的问题，特别是流媒体残差和人工智能，在两组谈判中都处于危险之中，这可能就是为什么 AMPTP 不愿意与 SAG 快速讨价还价的原因——它知道 WGA 可以利用这一点作为杠杆。相反，好莱坞大佬们似乎陷入了死亡漩涡，除了对工会和他们自己施加惩罚之外，不知道如何推动达成协议。<br><br>在这一点上，解决罢工问题的任何拖延对电影业来说都可能是世界末日。如果电影公司将谈判推迟数月，试图迫使工会陷入绝望，那么这些电影公司的产品最终将被电影院扣留，整体票房收入将直线下降，而这可能是好莱坞达到大流行前水平的最佳机会成功的喜悦将会溜走。是的， <em>《芭比娃娃》</em>和<em>《奥本海默》</em>将继续售票，八月份的几部动作片（ <em>《忍者神龟</em>》、 <em>《巨齿鲨 2</em> 》）应该会取得一定的成功，但目前所有关于票房的公司都将很快就忘记了。好莱坞刚刚得到了自 2019 年以来最明确的确认：电影仍然可以吸引现场观众。继续释放它们是个好主意。<br><br></div>

“世界就像，<em>我不在乎</em>，”她开玩笑说。<br><br>但全世界都非常关心他所出演的电影。自周五上映以来， <em>《芭比娃娃》的</em><a data-event-element="inline link"

<em>《芭比娃娃</em>》的大规模首映使这部电影成为葛韦格作为导演迄今为止最成功的票房作品。然而，这部电影完全符合葛韦格的全部作品：就像 2017 年的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/lady-bird-greta-gerwig-review/544721/"><em>《伯德小姐</em></a>》和 2019 年的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/"><em>《小妇人》</em></a>一样，它深入思考了如何表达女性气质。葛韦格与搭档诺亚·鲍姆巴赫 (Noah Baumbach) 共同创作的<em>《芭比娃娃》的分量</em>可能出乎意料地沉重。在闪闪发光的服装和盛大派对的背后是一个可爱的人文主义故事，它研究产品如何影响和反映我们是谁。<br><br>也许这听起来很崇高，但考虑一下芭比（玛格特·罗比饰）和肯在现实世界中的冒险，这在电影中不仅仅是鱼出水狂欢的机会。两人肩负着在一个对待男性和女性不同的社会中生存的艰巨任务：芭比作为一个代表理想女性的玩具，与她有缺陷的目的作斗争；肯（Ken）是专为芭比娃娃的手臂糖果而创造的，他通过观察人类第一次尝到了力量的滋味，并误解了他所看到的。<em>芭比娃娃</em>既顽皮又深思熟虑，充满笑话，常常超现实的奇观包裹着真诚、女权主义和彻底的葛韦格风格的核心。<br><br>然而，当我们周五早上交谈时，葛韦格并不知道<em>芭比娃娃</em>会如何着陆。正如她所说，她预计自己会“整天焦虑不安”，并且渴望聊天，而不是担心电影的反响。我们讨论了她电影中的主题，以及她在芭比乐园的经历教会了她什么。 （别担心，Ken 的粉丝们。我们最终会找到他的。）<br><br><em>为了篇幅和清晰度，本次对话已被编辑。</em><br><br><strong>雪莉·李：</strong>这部<em>芭比娃娃</em>电影中有很多关于自我价值的重要想法，以及我们消费的东西（或者玩玩偶的东西）如何影响我们成为什么样的人。我注意到一个小女孩在放映时问了很多问题；她似乎对那些令人兴奋的主题感到有点困惑，但玩得很开心，尤其是当娃娃们唱歌跳舞时。所以我很好奇：当你和诺亚写这部电影时，你把谁想象成你的观众？<br><br><strong>格蕾塔·葛韦格：</strong>我并没有强烈的感觉，<em>这是给孩子们的东西；这是给孩子们看的。这是成人的东西</em>。我知道有些东西更令人兴奋，但当我回顾小时候的观看经历时，往往那些超出我范围的东西是最引人注目的，因为它们感觉就像一扇小窗户，让我进入了我所看到的世界。正在兴起。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>比如什么？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>这是一个非常奇怪、非常具体的记忆，但当我五岁的时候，我爸爸在纽约工作，我和妈妈得到了去<em>吉普赛</em>的加急票。我大部分都听不懂，但是当吉普赛<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wErVF7QwIY&amp;ab_channel=ProjectUnleash">在滑稽俱乐部表演</a>时，这些脱衣舞娘穿着闪闪发光的老式脱衣舞服装，我很喜欢。我不明白发生了什么，但我们得到了一本很大的纪念书，我记得只是研究了所有脱衣舞娘所在的页面，因为我认为它们是<em>如此</em>美丽。我没有任何感觉他们被客观化了。我只是喜欢他们穿着这些漂亮、闪闪发光的衣服和大头饰。我可能有很多这样的回忆。<br><br><strong>李：</strong> <em>《伯德小姐》</em>是根据你自己的经历写的， <em>《小妇人</em>》是你从小就喜欢看的书，小时候也玩过芭比娃娃。用你的电影来重温童年的试金石对你来说是一个有意的选择吗？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>老实说，在制作它们的过程中，我一直隐藏着一些东西，因为从表面上看，它们看起来很不同。但现在我看完了这个，我发现他们都在围绕着这个想法。 [<em>笑。</em> 】 你对你感兴趣的东西感兴趣，我对女人感兴趣。但我也认为——这听起来有点愚蠢——我的一个痴迷，可以说是，我真的有点不敢相信我们生活在线性时间里。 [<em>笑。</em> ] 这真是令人震惊。显然，当你有一个孩子时，你会与这个孩子紧密相连，但你在生活中也可以与它相连。<br><br>我认为，在试图将它们整合在一起并了解你现在在哪里以及你曾经去过哪里的过程中，总是会感到<em>痛苦</em>。显然，这就是我改编<em>《小妇人》</em>的方式，因为我突然<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/">以一种我年轻时从未见过的方式将这些角色视为</a>成年人。 <em>《伯德小姐》</em>是一个关于一名高中生的故事，有些事情你觉得很重要，比如舞会，但实际上这是关于你的母亲和你的<em>离开</em>。这是我回归的话题，因为无论如何，电影本质上就是一个时间胶囊，所以它已经及时处理了。这就是我在智力和艺术上感兴趣的东西，而媒介本身似乎已经嵌入了这一点。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/">阅读：格蕾塔·葛韦格的<em>《小妇人》</em>终于给了艾米应得的</a><br><br><strong>李：</strong>也许更好的说法是：你的电影都是关于女孩如何学习成为女人的。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>哦，<em>是的</em>！<br><br><strong>李：</strong>我是不是把事情想得太简单了？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>不，我喜欢它！那好美丽。

不过，也许这就是你永远要做的事情。我不知道那是你到达的地方。这当然与年龄无关，因为它永远在展开。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>那么，你对少女时代最关心的是什么，拍这些电影也许可以帮助你理解？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>嗯，把它拆开是很困难的，但对我来说，这很大程度上与代际对话有关。当我想到我的祖母、我的母亲、我的时候，女性的生活已经发生了如此巨大的变化，我不知道接下来会发生什么变化，但我们不断互相学习。再过一周我就满 40 岁了，我开始以一种美妙的方式感觉到，我属于年轻女性回望的那一代，这种感觉美妙又奇怪。我确实认为这是一种让我能够深入地参与对话的方式，让我感觉值得拥有，无论是女性气质、人格还是线性时间中的存在。 [<em>笑。</em> ] 线性时间是我真正的一个难题。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>你说过制作这部电影就像你制作的任何其他电影一样个人化。有没有一个场景让你觉得这部电影对你来说非常个人化？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>从<em>芭比娃娃</em>徽标的字体（我一直被泡泡字母版本所吸引，部分原因是我在玩具“反”斗城看到的那个字体）到凯特·麦金农（Kate McKinnon）的角色非常重要这一事实，一切都包罗万象。反映了我拥有的芭比娃娃，一个被人喜爱的娃娃，但在盒子里不再处于原始完美的状态。芭比在长凳上看到的那个女人是我的朋友，杰出的服装设计师安·罗斯。我一直在思考面孔，当你看着她的面孔时，我想你看到了一种感觉就像是一种生活，而那个年龄不仅在其持续时间上有价值。<br><br> [当芭比娃娃和她的创造者牵手时]，所有这些视频剪辑都是从所有参与这部电影的人那里拍摄的——女性、母亲、姐妹、女儿、朋友。我坚信，即使你不知道电影中的内容，我认为你也能感受到它们。我一直很喜欢在<em>《好家伙》</em>中，马丁·斯科塞斯的母亲扮演妈妈。你不知道那是他的妈妈，但你觉得她就是那个人，而且感觉很私人。在某种程度上，这与一个孩子看电影时无法理解每一个参考内容，但以某种方式<em>感受到</em>它并没有什么不同。其中嵌入的个人信息是人们无意识收集的一部分。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>说到那些视频片段，我们再谈谈结局。你能告诉我关于让芭比娃娃和肯夫妇达成的决定吗？这不是一个最终的解决方案，而是一种缓和的方式？伊萨·雷饰演的芭比总统不允许肯在最高法院任职。他们还在想办法。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>我们<em>都</em>还在想办法——这只是其中的一部分。但我唯一能给任何人的就是他们仍然处于混乱之中。也许这对肯斯来说会好一点。你不想告诉人们如何观看事物，但在电影的结尾，制作设计将肯的一些迷恋融入了芭比乐园。就像，完美​​并不像开始将所有东西混合在一起那样美丽。我记得当我们去拍摄结局时，当我们都走在片场时，我们就像，<em>这是有史以来最美丽的</em>。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>你能告诉我为什么肯最终拒绝父权制吗？有趣的是，他承认他不明白。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong> [<em>沉默</em>]<br><br><strong>李：</strong>哦，不。格蕾塔，我失去你了吗？你好？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>嗨，好吧，我不知道发生了什么事。它就这样消失了。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>没关系。我觉得很有趣的是，一个关于肯的问题导致你挂断了电话。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong> [<em>笑。</em> ] 世界就像是，“我不在乎。”<br><br><strong>李：</strong>是的，“我们继续吧。”所以我想问：肯实际上并不想接管芭比乐园的想法从何而来？这部电影小心翼翼地将他描绘成一个被误导的反派，而不是一个怀恨在心的对手。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>嗯，在某种程度上，你会无意识地做事情，然后再将它们拼凑起来，但有一个元素让你感觉最后，你想要从自己手中被拯救出来。我猜它的黑暗反乌托邦版本是<em>《蝇王》</em> ，就像《野孩子》一样。他们是洋娃娃，但在心理上他们也是孩子。<br><br>事实上，我想到了我的继子。当他年轻的时候，他只是不睡觉。有一次，我走进他的卧室，他站在床上，把他的毛绒玩具扔来扔去，他尖叫道：“我希望有人能让我停下来！”它是如此纯粹[<em>笑</em>]，就像，实际上，他是对的！他希望有人能让他停下来。当瑞恩·高斯林和我谈论他将如何演绎结局时，我谈到了很多关于我 4 岁儿子的事。如果他哭了，你说：“哈罗德，我们不得不离开公园，你感到不安吗？”他会说：“是啊啊，是啊啊。”就像，他承认[他的悲伤]，但即使只是这样做也<em>很难</em>，那种情感的品质。<br><br>显然，这些系统对男性来说也很糟糕。当<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">美国发表美丽的演讲</a>时，我只是在抽泣，然后我环顾四周，发现片场里每个人都在哭。男人们也在哭，因为他们有自己的演讲，他们觉得自己永远无法发表，你知道吗？他们有自己的双钢丝，这也很痛苦。其中一些结构就是，你知道，“有人让我停下来！”我想这就是肯背后的感觉。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">阅读：理解<em>芭比</em>电影的令人惊讶的关键</a><br><br><strong>李：</strong>这是一部如此庞大的电影，也是你职业生涯中压力很大的时刻。作为一个电影人，你现在掌握着很大的权力，我想问你打算用它做什么？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong> [<em>笑。</em> ]<em>我想做什么？</em>成为一名电影制片人是一件了不起的事情，因为拍电影很困难，你永远无法真正登上山顶。因为无论你接下来要制作什么，你都还没有制作过——所以你会学到关于<em>这部</em>电影你不知道的东西，你知道吗？这很困难，但这也是吸引力的一部分。但是，如果你幸运的话，你只会每两年、三年、四年拍一部电影。所以，如果你开始计算人生，你就会意识到，<em>我要做什么，拍 15 部电影？</em>你知道，不是太多。但如果我幸运的话，我就能过上一种像我希望做的任何事情一样有意义的生活。我<em>确实</em>想在 60 多岁和 70 多岁时拍电影，如果上帝愿意，也许我会在 80 多岁时拍一些极其奇怪的电影。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>既然你已经完成了大预算工作室的主力，你认为你的故事讲述会如何发展？我想你并不总是在做生活中的数学。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>我希望能够制作各种规模的电影。我喜欢拥有制作微小东西的技能，也喜欢拥有用最大的画笔绘画的技能。它总是关于什么能给你最大的创造性自由，这可能意味着不同的事情。<br><br>我也感到非常幸运，能够成长为更大的人。我在 20 多岁的时候与人共同编剧、共同导演、演过很多戏，我就是利用这些来开始执导的。 <em>《小妇人》</em>是一个中间步骤，当我想到年轻的电影制作人时，取决于你想做什么，如果你有兴趣看看它如何扩展或收缩，那么这些中级电影的制作是令人难以置信的。我非常感激我能做到这一点，因为没有它我就不可能做到<em>这一点</em>。<br><br></div>

Robert Oppenheimer) 在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1949/02/the-open-mind/305431/">这本杂志</a>上写下了一场可怕的失败。自从曼哈顿计划在新墨西哥州引爆第一颗原子弹以来，已经过去了近四年。爆炸向周围的山脉发出了紫色的光芒，并从沙漠地面升起一道 40,000 英尺高的火柱、烟雾和碎片。但对奥本海默来说，余辉很快就暗淡了，取而代之的是存在主义的头号宿醉。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1949/02/the-open-mind/305431/">1949 年 2 月起：J. 罗伯特·奥本海默 (J.

He opposed the development of a much more powerful, second-generation atomic weapon—the hydrogen bomb, which Edward Teller called the “super”—in part because he was concerned it would accelerate an arms race with the Soviet Union. He also lent his prestige and credibility to ongoing efforts to avoid that arms race altogether. He helped draft the proposals that evolved into the Baruch Plan, an arms-control regime that the United States put before the United Nations. Under the latter&#39;s direction, all countries would forfeit their atomic-weapons programs, and atomic energy would be a global collective good, administered by a centralized regulatory body at the UN, over which no country would enjoy a veto.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/07/us-nuclear-strategy-cold-war-russia/638441/">Read: We have no nuclear strategy</a><br><br> After the final failure of these proposals at the UN, in 1948, Oppenheimer turned, as one does, to <em>The Atlantic</em> . His essay is a fascinating historical artifact and act of public grief. Titled “The Open Mind,” it lays out Oppenheimer&#39;s account of the back-and-forth over arms-control proposals. Soviet leaders had voted against them, but their response had not been wholly negative. They agreed that all countries should dismantle their atomic-weapons programs and that atomic energy should fall under international oversight. But they objected, perhaps understandably, to America&#39;s insistence on keeping its weapons program running until the new system was functional. They wanted President Harry Truman to disarm first, a condition that he could not abide.<br><br> During the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer&#39;s powers of foresight had failed him. However accurate his calculations concerning the innards of the atom, he&#39;d misjudged what would happen geopolitically after he and his colleagues wrenched it apart. Out of naivete, or the expedient blindness of ambition, or some combination of the two, he may have believed that he could stop its further use after the Nazis had been defeated, or that the terrifying spectacle of the bomb would eventually lead to a renunciation of ever larger weapons and wars.<br><br> In 1949, he understood that no such renunciation was in store. “We see no clear course before us that would persuade the governments of the world to join with us” in atomic disarmament, he wrote. This time, the implications were obvious, and they implicated America, which, as Oppenheimer laments, “responded by adopting some of the very measures that we had hoped might be universally renounced.” The mass manufacture of the atomic bomb was under way and American scientists had clear orders to put the new physics in service of even more destructive weapons.<br><br> Oppenheimer saw a cosmically bleak arms race taking shape, and this time his  foresight proved accurate. Within months, the Soviet Union successfully tested its first atomic bomb, and only three years later, in 1952, the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb roughly 500 times as powerful as the one that had largely destroyed Nagasaki. The Soviets followed suit a few years later, and by the time of Oppenheimer&#39;s death, in 1967, the two countries had nearly 40,000 nuclear weapons between them, many of them <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">set on a hair trigger</a> .<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">Read: Never give artificial intelligence the nuclear codes</a><br><br> Oppenheimer knew that he&#39;d helped to conjure this world into existence. He sought to prepare our readers for its horrors. In the main, his advice was to not lose hope, and to remember that our imagination of the future is limited. Oppenheimer was perhaps heartened by the quantum world, shot through as it is with uncertainty, that had captivated him in his youth. He seemed to draw strength from a belief that the macro world of human affairs is likewise contingent, such that nothing about our fate is ever settled.<br><br> Oppenheimer quotes from a speech that Abraham Lincoln gave in Baltimore three years into the Civil War. At the beginning of that conflict, few expected that “domestic slavery would be much affected,” Lincoln said, and yet it had been. Reality is unpredictable; it will surprise you. Lincoln reminded Oppenheimer that surprises swing both ways. A world that appears to be fallen can sometimes veer toward moral progress.<br><br> We have seen such swerves before, even in the nuclear realm. By the 1980s, enormous arsenals of nuclear weapons appeared to be a fact of life on planet Earth. In 1986, the Soviet Union&#39;s stockpile reached an all-time high of about 40,000 warheads, and the United States had more than 20,000. Very few people imagined that the end of the Cold War was imminent. Nor could many have guessed that in 1991, George HW Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev would sign the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the first in an extraordinary sequence of agreements that shrank the two countries&#39; arsenals to less than a quarter of their previous size.<br><br> Bush and Gorbachev were wise to seize the day, because that era&#39;s peace—and its clean two-party strategic symmetry—proved ephemeral. The specter of nuclear annihilation has since returned with force to the global collective psyche. Vladimir Putin has invoked it in speeches about his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://Read:%20What%20if%20Russia%20uses%20nuclear%20weapons%20in%20Ukraine?">invasion of Ukraine</a> . China has built up an arsenal that may be large enough to destroy every major American city.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/russia-ukraine-nuclear-weapon-us-response/661315/">Read: What if Russia uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine?</a><br><br> As Oppenheimer well understood, there is no <em>technological</em> reason that world-threatening stockpiles of nuclear weapons will not be with us for hundreds of thousands of years. To keep large numbers of them in place for that long, in a strategic setting where any small exchange could very easily become a large one, is to play a fool&#39;s game. No one should feel safe because seven decades have passed without another incident of nuclear warfare; that sample size is too small.<br><br> Beyond advising hope, Oppenheimer didn&#39;t offer much guidance as to how we might dismantle the sword of Damocles that he helped to string up above human civilization. A notorious dandy and eloquent impromptu speaker, he was always drawn to style; in his <em>Atlantic</em> essay, he invokes it in a higher form. “It is style,” he wrote, “which, in the domain of foreign policy, enables us to find a harmony between the pursuit of ends essential to us, and the regard for the views, the sensibilities, the aspirations of those to whom the problem may appear in another light.”<br><br> The problem Oppenheimer had in mind was arms control. He asked that those who negotiate on America&#39;s behalf carry out their work in a spirit of openness. He asked that they appeal to the reasoning minds of those who sit across the table. He appears to have believed—or to have wanted to believe—that a widespread adoption of this style might be enough to set into motion a new evolutionary step in geopolitics, through which the world&#39;s major powers might come to a shared understanding that peace is the highest wisdom. To this end, he counseled patience. Time and nature must be allowed to do their work, he noted. Seven decades on, it looks to be slow work indeed.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 17:41:20 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/j-robert-oppenheimer-ideas-history/674814/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/j-robert-oppenheimer-ideas-history/674814/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Elon Killed the Bird]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Three theories about Twitter&#39;s seemingly nonsensical rebrand to X <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/JZeYzwBTVyFMw8BhsJxJAECy7ms=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/twitter_X_horz/original.jpg" alt="Twitter 的鸟标志位于 X 上方" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Ben Kothe / The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> In May, Elon Musk presided over an uncharacteristically subtle tweak to Twitter&#39;s home page. For years, the prompt in the text box at the top of the page read, “What&#39;s happening?,” a friendly invitation for users to share their thoughts. Eight months after the billionaire&#39;s takeover, Twitter <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/05/12/heres-how-twitters-appearance-has-changed-under-elon-musk/?sh=76231c985f68">changed</a> the prompt ever so slightly to match the puzzling, chaotic nature of the platform under the new regime: “What&#39;s happening?” became “What is happening?!”<br><br> This question, with its exclamatory urgency, has never been more relevant to Twitter than in the past 48 hours, when Musk decided to nuke 17 years&#39; worth of brand awareness and rename the thing. The artist formerly known as Twitter is now X. <em>What is happening?!</em> indeed.<br><br> I have three answers to that question, beyond the simple “Nothing much.” (Even with its new name, the site is pretty much the same as ever; the blue bird logo in the left-hand corner of the website is now a black <em>X</em> , and … that&#39;s about it.) This X boondoggle may simply be the flailing of a man who doesn&#39;t want to own his social network and was pressured via lawsuit to buy it, but Musk and the Twitter (X?) CEO, Linda Yaccarino, would like you to believe that much bigger things are coming.<br><br> <strong>1. Musk wants to build the “Internet of Elon.”</strong><br><br> The first theory requires taking Musk&#39;s ambitions somewhat seriously. In a tweet last October, he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633">declared</a> that “buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Versions of these “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/18/23687125/elon-musk-twitter-x-super-app-wechat">super apps</a> ” already exist and are popular in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, so we know what this means: X would function as a holistic platform that includes payment processing and banking, ride-sharing, news, communication with friends, and loads and loads of commerce. Think of it as the internet, but without leaving Musk&#39;s walled garden. In a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23171541/leaked-transcript-elon-musk-first-meeting-twitter-employees">leaked</a> recording of a Twitter town hall back in June 2022, Musk hinted that China&#39;s WeChat was a model of sorts for X. “There&#39;s no WeChat movement outside of China,” he said. “And I think that there&#39;s a real opportunity to create that. You basically live on WeChat in China because it&#39;s so useful and so helpful to your daily life. And I think if we could achieve that, or even close to that with Twitter, it would be an immense success.”<br><br> If you squint, you can see the logic. Plenty of people across Twitter—influencers, freelancers, small-business owners—use the platform to sell things. Many of these people use various “link in bio” pages to direct people to their work and receive payment. X, the theoretical everything app, could streamline and consolidate these exchanges, and, like WeChat, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/">generate revenue</a> from them. Musk has already launched a program to share ad revenue with some of Twitter&#39;s larger “creator” accounts, the early beneficiaries of which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/twitter-creators-payments-right-wing/">included</a> many prominent right-wing shock jocks. And if he could manage to get hundreds of millions of people to live and shop and bank on his app, instead of, say, shitpost memes and argue politics with white nationalists, that would be an immense success.<br><br> To do that, X would need to build out an advanced, secure payment platform; apply the appropriate regulatory licenses to legally process payments and store money; and, of course, recruit businesses and financial institutions to use the platform. According to the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/9d84d534-b2dd-4cff-85d1-aee137b26a45"><em>Financial Times</em></a> , the company began filing applications for those licenses early this year and has been at work building parts of a payment infrastructure. The bad news is that the person Musk tasked with spearheading the project was laid off—along with about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html">80 percent</a> of Twitter&#39;s workforce.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/elon-musk-twitter-ethics-algorithm-biases/673110/">Read: I watched Elon Musk kill Twitter&#39;s culture from the inside</a><br><br> Musk does have experience in the payments business. He founded an online bank—also called X.com—in 1999, and it shortly thereafter merged with Confinity to become PayPal. Perhaps this would give his super-app idea some credibility, if not for Musk having spent the past 15 months blundering through his latest business venture in full view of the public. He has alienated advertisers with his reactionary and conspiratorial political opinions, sent the company deep into debt, and, at times, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-outage-elon-musk-user-restrictions/674609/">rendered the platform unusable</a> by limiting how many tweets users can see. The platform appears to be shrinking under Musk&#39;s leadership, according to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-traffic-falls-under-elon-musk-threads-mastodon-bluesky-competition/">third-party</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1678065025750294532?s=20">traffic data</a> . Spam <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/09/technology/elon-musk-twitter-spam-bots.html">is</a> rampant, and the most satisfied users seem to be previously banned racists and anti-Semites who have regained access to their megaphone.<br><br> It&#39;s already a hard sell for Musk to convince people that his sputtering platform is the best place for posting <em>Barbenheimer</em> memes, let alone the right home for … everything, including our money. But the cognitive dissonance between Musk&#39;s reputational hemorrhaging and his grand ambitions is easier to bridge when you consider the second way to explain X, which is that it&#39;s a desperate shot in the dark.<br><br> <strong>2. X is <em>pseudoware</em> —just buzzwords and a logo.</strong><br><br> Unlike Facebook&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg/620538/">pivot to Meta</a> , which was oriented around a real (though flawed and unappealing) virtual-reality product, X is a rebrand built on little more than a vague collection of buzzwords cobbled together to form a complete sentence. On Sunday, Yaccarino <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213895463215104?s=20">described</a> the forthcoming app as “the future state of unlimited interactivity” that is “centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking—creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.” She also noted that, “powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we&#39;re just beginning to imagine.” (Yaccarino did not respond to a request for comment.)<br><br> Her tweet is a near-perfect example of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/630ec150bcbd490021b17eab/business-dudes-need-to-stop-talking-like-this/">business-dude <em>lorem ipsum</em></a> —corporate gibberish that sounds superficially intelligent but is actually obfuscating. What is “unlimited interactivity?” How will X be “powered by AI”? Does she mean generative AI like ChatGPT or standard algorithms of the sort that have powered Twitter&#39;s “For you” feed for years? The particulars are irrelevant: The words just need to sound like <em>something</em> when strung together.<br><br> Musk, too, is guilty of such blabber. He has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1683324036950966273?s=20">argued</a> that his hypothetical project, if built correctly, could “become half of the global financial system.” This is the empty language of a dilettante, the equivalent of me telling you that this article, if written correctly, is on pace to win the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism, or that I am the executive wordsmith for <em>The Atlantic</em> ’s Words About Computers section.<br><br> Musk&#39;s and Yaccarino&#39;s descriptions of X don&#39;t just suggest <em>vaporware</em> , an industry term for a hyped-up product that never materializes. They feel like something else, too: I&#39;d call it <em>pseudoware</em> . Like a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/6258e039dc551a00208cc5e1/elon-musk-meme-stocks-and-retail-investing-for-the-superrich/">pseudo-event</a> , pseudoware masquerades as something newsworthy, even though it is not. Yaccarino&#39;s Mad Libs–ian tweetstorm is the press release for this pseudo-event: big talk for a pivot that has so far manifested in ornamental changes. Musk&#39;s first orders of business have been to adopt a new logo and to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1683541303680987136?s=20">project</a> it in conference rooms at headquarters. When Yaccarino tweeted that “X will connect us all in ways we&#39;re just beginning to imagine,” I take her at her word: No one seems to have spent much time thinking about any of this.<br><br> It&#39;s natural to wonder why the world&#39;s richest man would spend his time dismantling one of the world&#39;s most recognizable social-media brands in favor of an inscrutable super app nobody asked for. He could, at any moment, jet off to a private island and drink bottomless piña coladas while giggling about Dogecoin instead! Herein lies the third and most important explanation for X, which is that it is a reputational line of credit for Musk.<br><br> <strong>3. Musk needs to save face.</strong><br><br> Musk&#39;s reputation is dependent on people believing that he can gin up new categories of industry and see around corners to build futuristic stuff. His $44 billion acquisition of Twitter was marketed with a visionary framework: Musk would realize Twitter&#39;s dreams of being a truly global town square and solve the intractable problems of free speech at scale. Having failed at that, Musk is, in essence, going back to basics with X—it&#39;s an opportunity to remake the internet in his own image.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-outage-elon-musk-user-restrictions/674609/">Read: Elon Musk really broke Twitter this time</a><br><br> As <em>Bloomberg</em> ’s Max Chafkin <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/chafkin/status/1683475959981264900/photo/2">pointed out</a> , Musk&#39;s original X.com brand was a total failure. He was obsessed with the name and the web address, but consumers, not illogically, associated the brand with adult-entertainment sites. Musk was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-elon-musk-fired-from-paypal/">ousted</a> by X.com&#39;s board after the merger in 2000, a year before the service was renamed PayPal, but the payment company remains an important part of his legacy. X, then, is a callback to a younger version of the entrepreneur—one who is associated with success, products that work, and generous investor returns. It also represents unfinished business and a chance to rewrite an earlier phase of his career.<br><br> In this sense, X is less a brilliant vision than it is an act of desperation. Musk is behaving much like a start-up with an unsustainable burn rate—he needs a cash injection. And in order to raise some reputational capital, he needs a good idea, one that seems plausible and scalable. X checks all the boxes for such an idea. Its ambitions are so vague as to be boundless, which signals perpetual growth and moneymaking—it is, quite literally, the <em>everything</em> app. In this way, X is an inkblot test for anyone who still wants to believe in Musk: Squint the right way and X takes on the form of whatever hopes and dreams that person has for the future of the internet. This is the fleeting genius of pseudoware: The best feature of marketing an app for everything is that you can get away with saying mostly nothing.<br><br> But just how many people still have unwavering faith in Musk is an open question. How many people are willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the man who can&#39;t pay his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/twitter-evicted-boulder-office-colorado-unpaid-rent-elon-musk-16949921.htm#:~:text=The%20company%20failed%20to%20pay,to%20non%2Dpayment%20of%20rent.">rents</a> and server <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.platformer.news/p/twitter-stiffs-google">bills</a> on time? Who is going to help build this technological behemoth for the man who fired the majority of his company and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/12/twitter-severance-payments-lawsuit">allegedly</a> owes $500 million in severance payments? And, perhaps most important, who is excited about what Musk is focusing his time, energy, and money on?<br><br> Even though X wants to be big, a WeChat clone is conceptually small in comparison with the projects that have allowed Musk to market himself as a savant: space exploration, rewiring the human brain, revolutionizing transportation to save the Earth. The most cynical view of X is that the people who still respect Musk are reactionaries who delight only when their enemies have been gleefully trolled. Perhaps, then, Musk&#39;s dismantling of the social network is a success, so long as it makes the right people miserable. Left with few options, Musk has decided to mortgage the Twitter brand to save his own. Even by his standards, it&#39;s a risky bet.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 16:56:12 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-musk-x-rebrand/674818/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-musk-x-rebrand/674818/</item></channel></rss>
