href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adj7023">包裹</a>的标题是“<span class="smallcaps">民主被拦截</span>”。 “平台推送是否在 2020 年美国总统大选期间播下了深刻分歧的种子？”大问题。 （可怕的问题！）根据今天发表在世界上最负盛名的两本研究期刊<em>《科学》</em>和<em>《自然》</em>上的一组研究，令人惊讶的答案是：“可能不会，或者在任何短期内都不会，但人们永远无法真正确定。”<br><br>毫无疑问，美国政治格局是两极分化的，而且在过去几十年里变得<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/05/us-democrat-republican-partisan-polarization/629925/">更加两极分化</a>。互联网在其中发挥了一定作用，这似乎既合乎逻辑又明显，今天阴谋论和不良信息比社交媒体之前更容易传播，距离我们还不到三年的时间，一场<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-papers-democracy-election-zuckerberg/620478/">部分由利用社交媒体策划的</a>叛乱发生了。 Facebook 创建的工具。轶事证据很能说明问题。但我们现在拥有的最好的科学传达了一些不同的信息。<br><br> <em>《科学》</em>杂志上的三篇新论文和<em>《自然》</em>杂志上的一篇新论文是 Facebook 和 Instagram 背后的公司 Meta 与学术科学家之间罕见、密切合作的首批成果。作为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://research.facebook.com/2020-election-research/">2020 年选举研究项目</a>的一部分，该项目由德克萨斯大学奥斯汀分校教授塔利亚·斯特劳德 (Talia Stroud) 和纽约大学教授约书亚·塔克 (Joshua Tucker) 领导，调查人员团队获得了大量访问 Facebook 和 Instagram 用户数据的权限，并允许进行需要直接操纵数万名同意用户的提要的实验。 Meta 没有补偿其学术合作伙伴，也没有对研究方法、分析或结论拥有最终决定权。不过，为了保护用户隐私，该公司确实对合作伙伴的数据访问设定了一定的限制。它还支付研究本身的费用，并在过去向一些学者（包括主要作者）提供研究经费。 Meta 员工是这些论文的合著者之一。<br><br>这种动态本质上是令人担忧的：Meta，一家非常强大的公司，长期以来一直因<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/12/facebook-doomsday-machine/617384/">破坏美国民主的缝隙</a>以及将外部研究人员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-oversight-data-independent-research/620557/">拒之门外而受到</a>批评，现在它支持的研究表明，<em>嘿，也许社交媒体的影响是还不错</em>。与此同时，该项目为了解两个最大的社交平台上的实际行为提供了一个独特的窗口，并且似乎经过了合法的审查。威斯康星大学麦迪逊分校新闻学教授迈克尔·瓦格纳（Michael Wagner）担任此次合作的独立观察员，他的评价<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2430">收录</a>在<em>《科学</em>》特刊中：“我的结论是，该团队进行了严格、仔细检查、透明、道德和路径-突破性的研究，”他写道，但他补充说，这种独立性只能通过公司分配来实现。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-oversight-data-independent-research/620557/">阅读：没有人可以看到 Facebook</a><br><br>新发表的研究单独来看很有趣，但放在一起阅读时才更有意义。首先，宾夕法尼亚大学传播学教授桑德拉·冈萨雷斯·拜隆 (Sandra González-Bailón) 领导的一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade7138">研究</a>证实了社交媒体上存在回音室。尽管<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://andyguess.com/publication/guess-2020-everything/">之前使用网络浏览数据的研究</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/126/4/1799/1924154">发现</a>，大多数人总体上具有相当平衡的信息饮食，但似乎并非每个在线环境都是如此。 González-Bailón 的团队总结道：“Facebook 作为一个社交和信息环境，在意识形态上基本上是隔离的，而被事实核查人员评为“虚假”的新闻条目往往聚集在该网络的“同质保守角落”。因此，该平台的回音室可能是真实的，错误信息在政治光谱的一侧影响更大。但这会对用户的政治产生什么影响呢？<br><br>在另外三篇论文中，研究人员能够通过在激烈的选举季节实时进行的随机实验来研究信息环境在多大程度上加剧了分裂。他们还测试了一些关于如何修复社交媒体的著名理论（例如通过减少病毒式内容）是否会产生任何影响。由达特茅斯学院政府教授布伦丹·尼汉 (Brendan Nyhan) 领导的发表在<em>《自然》</em>杂志上的这项研究尝试了另一种方法：在他们的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06297-w">实验</a>中，尼汉和他的团队在三个月内大幅减少了人们在 Facebook 上看到的“志趣相投的来源”的内容量2020 年选举周期期间和之后。从 9 月下旬到 12 月，研究人员对大约 7,000 名同意用户的提要中的内容进行了“降级”，如果这些内容来自任何来源（朋友、群组或页面），预计会分享用户的政治信仰。干预没有起到作用。回音室确实变得不那么强烈，但根据后续调查的结果，受影响的用户的政治观点保持不变。与对照组相比，实验参与者的意识形态信仰最终变得极端，对民主党和共和党的态度也同样极端。<br><br>发表在<em>《科学》杂志</em>上的另外两项实验研究也得出了类似的结论。两项研究均由普林斯顿大学政治和公共事务助理教授安德鲁·盖斯 (Andrew Guess) 领导，并且都基于从 9 月下旬到 2020 年 12 月的三个月期间收集的数据。在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.add8424">一项实验</a>中，盖斯的团队试图删除所有被朋友、群组或大量 Facebook 用户提要的页面转发的帖子，以测试这样做是否可以减轻病毒式传播的有害影响。 （由于一些技术限制，仍然保留了少量转发的帖子。）干预成功地减少了人们对政治新闻的接触，并降低了他们对网站的整体参与度，但再一次，新闻推送的调整并没有减少人们对政治新闻的接触。用户的政治极化程度或改变他们的政治态度。<br><br> Guess 和同事的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abp9364">第二个实验</a>同样直率：它选择性地关闭了某些 Facebook 和 Instagram 用户的动态排名算法，而是按时间顺序呈现帖子。这一变化导致用户在平台上花费的总体时间减少，并且与帖子的互动频率降低。尽管如此，就政治极化而言，按时间顺序排列的用户最终与控制者没有什么不同。关闭平台算法三个月并没有削弱他们的信念。<br><br>换句话说，平均而言，这三种干预措施都未能将用户从意识形态极端中拉回来。与此同时，它们还产生了许多其他影响。 “这些平台上的实验，可以说它们所展示的是已经提出的突出的、相对简单的修复方案——它们带来了意想不到的后果，”盖斯告诉我。其中一些是违反直觉的。盖斯以删除转发帖子的实验为例。这减少了人们从不可信来源看到的新闻帖子数量，也减少了他们从可信来源看到的新闻帖子数量。事实上，研究人员发现，受影响的用户对主流新闻媒体的曝光率下降了 62%，并且在有关近期新闻事件的测验中表现出较差的迹象。<br><br>所以这很新颖。但四项研究叙述的要点——网上回声室很重要，但可能不足以解释线下政治冲突——不应感到陌生。 “从我作为该领域研究人员的角度来看，令人惊讶的发现可能比一般公众要少，”未参与这项研究的密歇根大学副教授乔什·帕塞克告诉我。 “回音室故事是一种令人难以置信的媒体叙事，它具有认知意义，”但它不太可能解释人们实际信仰的大部分差异。这种立场曾经看起来比今天更加<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/health-and-science/2018/01/weve-been-told-were-living-in-a-post-truth-age-dont-believe-it.html">逆反</a>。 “我们的结果与政治学的许多研究结果一致，”盖斯说。 “你不会发现人们的信息环境对态度、观点或自我报告的政治参与等事物产生重大影响。”<br><br>算法很强大，但人也很强大。 Nyhan 团队进行的实验减少了用户提要中出现的志同道合的内容数量，但受试者仍然寻找他们同意的内容。事实上，与对照组相比，他们最终更有可能参与他们所看到的向唱诗班讲道的帖子。 “重要的是要记住，人们不仅仅是算法提供给他们的信息的被动接收者，”尼汉告诉我，他还在 2018 年与人<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://kf-site-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media_elements/files/000/000/133/original/Topos_KF_White-Paper_Nyhan_V1.pdf">合着了一篇题为“避免回声室关于回声室”的文献评论</a>。他补充说，我们都会选择追随谁、追随什么。这些选择可能会受到平台推荐的影响，但它们仍然是<em>我们的</em>。<br><br>研究人员肯定会在这一点和其他方面受到一些阻力，特别是考虑到他们与 Facebook 的密切合作关系以及一系列可能被解读为让这家社交媒体巨头摆脱困境的调查结果。 （即使社交媒体回声室并没有像人们所怀疑的那样扭曲政治格局，Meta 仍然<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-failed-the-world/620479/">在努力</a>控制其平台上的错误信息。令人担忧的是，正如冈萨雷斯-拜隆的论文所指出的那样，新闻报道是最受关注的研究期间在 Facebook 上发布的次数题为“宾夕法尼亚州垃圾桶中发现的军事选票——大多数都是特朗普选票。”）Facebook 全球事务负责人尼克·克莱格 (Nick Clegg) 在今天发表的一篇关于这项研究的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/research-social-media-impact-elections/">博客文章</a>中表示，取得了胜利“越来越多的研究表明，几乎没有证据表明社交媒体会造成有害的‘情感’两极分化，或者对关键的政治态度、信仰或行为产生任何有意义的影响。”尽管研究人员承认这种令人不安的情况，但无法回避的事实是，如果 Meta 决定终止合作，他们的研究可能会陷入危险。<br><br>柏林马克斯·普朗克人类发展研究所的研究员菲利普·洛伦茨-斯普林（Philipp Lorenz-Spreen）没有参与这项研究，他承认这种设置并不“适合真正独立的研究”，但他告诉我，他“完全相信这是一项伟大的努力。我确信这些研究是我们目前在美国大选期间社交媒体上对美国人口的最好的研究。”<br><br>这很大，但综合考虑，也相当小。这些研究仅涵盖了美国近代政治史上一个非常特定时期的三个月。对于此类实验来说，三个月是一个重要的窗口期——洛伦茨-斯宾称之为“令人印象深刻的长”——但在历史力量的漩涡中，它似乎微不足道。如果社交媒体算法在 2020 年底的特定时间段内没有造成太大的选民两极分化，那么它们可能仍然会在 2016 年大选前以及之前的几年里加深美国政治中的裂痕在那之后。<br><br>德国康斯坦茨大学数据科学教授 David Garcia 也在<em>《自然》杂志</em>上发表了一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://06%20https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02325-x">文章</a>；他的结论是，这些实验虽然意义重大，但“并不排除新闻推送算法导致两极分化加剧的可能性。”这些实验是在个人身上进行的，正如加西亚在一封电子邮件中向我所说的那样，两极分化是“一种集体现象”。他说，“即使可能的话”，要完全证明算法在美国和其他国家的两极分化加剧中发挥的作用，将是一项更加艰巨的任务。<br><br></div>

Power]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>在《Nothing Compares 2 U》让她家喻户晓之前，这位爱尔兰歌手第一张专辑中的一首单曲让她成为了一股创造力。 <br><figure><img

Compares》</em>中有一个坦率的时刻，这位歌手说：“成为一名流行歌星对我来说真是太震惊了。这不是我想要的。我只是想尖叫。” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/arts/music/sinead-oconnor-dead.html">昨天去世</a>，享年 56 岁的奥康纳在 80 年代末就成名了，当时她才十几岁。 1990 年，她翻唱的 Prince 的《Nothing Compares 2 U》不仅成为了她的标志性歌曲，而且还登上了许多国家的排行榜榜首——这一横扫将一个害羞的爱尔兰孩子推到了国际关注的烈日之下。<br><br>她不但没有控制自己的声音，反而继续尖叫。多年来，她的许多有争议的抗议和声明往往掩盖了她令人惊叹的作品。当人们发誓要谋杀你时（就像她在<em>《周六夜现场</em>》撕毁了教皇约翰·保罗二世的照片后所做的那样），而弗兰克·西纳特拉公开威胁要攻击你（就像当她拒绝在一个体育场播放美国国歌时，他所做的那样） 1990 年新泽西音乐会），很难将注意力转回到真正让你出名的事情上：你的音乐。<br><br>她成为一名流行歌星——不仅仅是任何流行歌星，而是有史以来最独特、最直言不讳、最有影响力的歌星之一——这一事实可能让她感到惊讶。但这对她的粉丝来说并不意外。没有什么比她的第一首热门歌曲“Mandinka”更能说明这一点了。这首歌成为英国前 20 名热门单曲，是她 1987 年出色的首张唱片《 <em>The Lion and the Cobra》</em>中最出色的单曲，也是显而易见的耳熟能详的单曲。这是一张雄心勃勃的专辑，收集了童年创伤的黑暗描述（“特洛伊”）以及对欲望和同意的分层探索（“我想要你（把手放在我身上）”）。在这些更深沉、要求更高的单曲中，<em>狮子和眼镜蛇</em>需要一个乐观的邀请。就是“曼丁卡”。 <br><br><div class="oembed"

年代。歌词本身并没有传达叙事，但就像奥康纳的许多歌曲一样，《Mandinka》综合并投射了一系列图像、指责和咒语。她的话语中凝聚着对父权制的一系列不满，因为父权制拒绝为了目的而牺牲诗歌。标题来自亚历克斯·哈利（Alex Haley）的<em>《根源》</em> （Roots），其中提到了冈比亚曼丁卡族（Mandinka）。 《Mandinka》稍微领先于它的时代，但它也与同时代的歌曲（如 Neneh Cherry 的《Buffalo Stance》和 Enya 的《Orinoco Flow》）处于同一阵营。 （毫不奇怪，她的爱尔兰艺术家同胞恩雅客串了<em>《狮子与眼镜蛇》</em> 。）<br><br> 《Mandinka》的核心是一首反抗之歌。奥康纳将她能做到的每一点细节和音域——咆哮、吟诵、咕咕声，还有，是的，尖叫——都投入到了这首歌中，结果是对传统的一击。伤害是“曼丁卡”DNA 的一部分，尽管奥康纳对自己抵御伤害的能力感到欣喜若狂：“我不知道羞耻/我感觉不到痛苦/我看不到火焰，”她唱道毒液。再次，反抗。但这并不是否认或虚张声势，而是承认她如何自豪地使用自己的疤痕组织作为原材料。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/04/how-nothing-compares-2-u-endured/391122/">阅读：“Nothing Compares 2 U”如何经受住考验</a><br><br>“很快我就能把我的心交给你，”奥康纳在《Mandinka》的结尾高呼道。她正是这样做的：三年后，华丽浪漫的“Nothing Compares 2 U”问世，成为大多数人听到奥康纳名字时立即想到的歌曲。但《Nothing Compares 2 U》的力量部分源于这样一个事实：奥康纳已经证明自己有能力在<em>《狮子和眼镜蛇》</em>中发挥更大的力量，尤其是在《曼丁卡》中。她第一次出现在美国电视节目是<em>《大卫深夜秀》</em> ，她在这首单曲中的表演很能说明问题。她穿着一件像朋克摇滚盔甲一样的尖刺牛仔夹克，双臂放在身前，前后扭动，就像她在拳击场上躲避打击一样。<br><br>也许对《Mandinka》影响最简洁的致敬是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB3qDlu5Nvg">Fiona Apple 于 2017 年发布在 YouTube 上的一段视频</a>。在视频中，Apple 躺在床上，拿着笔记本电脑，一边跟着奥康纳 1989 年格莱美表演一边唱歌一边打拳。这是一个历史性的事件：当年获得最佳摇滚女歌手提名的奥康纳臭名昭著地将公敌的靶心标志画在头上，以抗议格莱美新颁发的最佳说唱表演奖是在镜头外授予的。 （昨天在 Twitter 上，该组织的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/MrChuckD/status/1684278409868763160">Chuck D</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/FlavorFlav/status/1684305143574003715">Flavor Flav</a>都记得这次抗议。）<br><br>当副歌响起时，苹果提高音量并亲吻屏幕。这是一种快乐的释放和赋权的姿态，反映了歌曲本身。 “我并不是故意要坚强，”奥康纳在弗格森的纪录片开头说道。 “我并没有对自己说，<em>我必须坚强</em>。我不知道我很坚强。”然而，只要听一听“曼丁卡”，其他人就能知道、感受到并发现自己被她的力量所增强。<br><br></div>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1_RKu-ESCY">视频</a>中，这些非凡的手段围绕着治安维持力量的威胁，以坚守阵线，打击他所描述的大城市的犯罪和混乱。在特朗普的政治信息中，这些手段是他为了“让美国再次伟大”而系统性地破坏国家规范和潜在的法律。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/trumps-rhetoric-of-white-nostalgia/485192/">阅读：特朗普关于白人怀旧的言论</a><br><br>与特朗普一样，阿尔丁也利用了共和党基础选民普遍存在的焦虑情绪，即他们的价值观在文化和种族多样性不断增加的不断变化的美国中被边缘化。每个人都传达出这样的信息：需要采取极端措施，甚至延伸到暴力，才能防止这种流离失所。<br><br> “即使对于家乡的主流保守派选民来说……我们必须进行文化反革命的想法已经根深蒂固，”保守派道德与公共政策中心的研究员帕特里克·布朗告诉我。 “乡村音乐是实现这一目标的一个渠道这一事实一点也不令人惊讶。”<br><br>阿尔丁的好战歌谣<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.american1.com/aldeans-anthem-stirs-controversy-singer-stands-firm/?fbclid=IwAR1dJFKfDIccobxruZSvRQ-__dL3B0EB9FX3wa2g_k4gAww6LhTU8KlROdY_aem_AaykaK9c4E033DtERVYBeawFQjIYpdx_m03qA0kVTummaZB4hShbSnkaKyA3RB09stk&amp;mibextid=2JQ9oc">在受到批评者谴责后，下载量增加了十倍以上</a>，它遵循了乡村歌曲反对对美国现状的挑战的传统。这种抵制在李·格林伍德 (Lee Greenwood) 的早期里程碑作品《上帝保佑美国》(God Bless the USA) 中得到了体现，该书自 1984 年发行以来一直是共和党集会的主要内容。阿尔丁甚至更直接地引用了梅尔·哈格德 (Merle Haggard) 1970 年的乡村大片，该片警告那些反对越南战争和“破坏我的国家”的人，正如标题所宣称的那样，将会看到“我战斗的一面”。 （此前，哈格德在他 1969 年的热门歌曲《 <i>Okie From Muskogee》</i>中表达了类似的想法，该歌曲颂扬了美国小镇，“我们不会在大街上烧掉我们的选秀卡。”）<br><br>在理查德·尼克松担任总统期间，哈加德的歌曲（他后来的矛盾心理）成为保守派的颂歌，就像罗纳德·里根执政期间格林伍德的歌曲一样。这个时机并非巧合：在这两个时期，这些领导人都将共和党定义为反对扰乱国家的社会变革。这又是一个这样的时刻：特朗普将自己的吸引力集中在将自己描绘成他的支持者与一系列影子势力之间的最后一道防线——包括“全球主义精英”、“深层政府”、暴力的城市少数群体和无证移民——据称威胁他们。<br><br>阿尔丁虽然是特朗普的坚定支持者，但他是一名表演者，而不是政治家；他的歌表达的是一种态度，而不是一个节目。然而，阿尔丁和特朗普都利用了保守派白人基督徒中普遍存在的信念，尤其是阿尔丁神话般的小镇上的基督徒，他们认为，在一个不可阻挡地变得更加多元化、世俗化和城市化的社会中，他们是偏见的真正受害者。<br><br>自2016年特朗普首次当选以来的多项全国民意调查中，十分之九的共和党人表示美国的基督教受到攻击；多达四分之三的人同意，对白人的偏见现在与对少数族裔的歧视一样严重；大约十分之七的人同意，社会只是因为表现得像男人而惩罚男人，而且白人现在是美国社会最受歧视的群体。<br><br>相信特朗普也有这些担忧，并致力于解决这些问题，这一信念始终是他与共和党选民联系的关键。每当他做了或说了一些看似站不住脚的事情时，共和党选民就会聚集在他周围——即使在 1 月 6 日的叛乱中，这一过程现在似乎仍在重复。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://brightlinewatch.org/uncharted-territory-the-aftermath-of-presidential-indictments/">在由研究美国民主威胁的政治学家合作组织 Bright Line Watch 昨天发布的一项全国调查中</a>，60% 的共和党人（相比之下只有三分之一的独立人士和六分之一的民主党人）将 1 月 6 日的骚乱描述为合法的政治事件反对。只有略高于十分之一的共和党人表示，特朗普在 1 月 6 日或在其推翻 2020 年总统选举结果的更广泛竞选活动中的行为犯了罪行。<br><br> 1 月 6 日保守派中的修正主义粉饰有助于解释为什么阿尔丁在没有任何明显的矛盾或讽刺感的情况下，可以将他的歌曲集中在“好男孩，正确举起”的暴力幻想上，对那些“咒骂警察”的人进行惩罚”或“践踏国旗”。特朗普的支持者，其中许多人可能符合阿尔丁对“好男孩”的描述，他们在 2021 年袭击国会大厦时正是做了这些事情。（例​​如，1 月 6 日来自阿肯色州的骚乱者，本周被判处 52 个月监禁）因用旗帜袭击警察<i>而</i>被监禁。）然而，阿尔丁将这些歌词与不是叛乱的图像，而是在城市街道上横冲直撞的阴暗抗议者的图像结合在一起。<br><br>阿尔丁无视 1 月 6 日的袭击事件，同时强调 2020 年乔治·弗洛伊德被谋杀后有时与大规模种族正义抗议活动一起爆发的左翼暴力，阿尔丁和特朗普一样，明确声明了他认为这项法律的目的是针对谁。保护和压制的对象。该视频在视觉上强调了这一信息，因为它是在田纳西州法院外拍摄的，一名年轻的黑人于 1927 年在那里被私刑处死。阿尔丁表示，他不知道其中的联系，并且否认这首歌中有任何种族主义意图。但正如范德比尔特大学历史学家妮可·海默 (Nicole Hemmer)

所写的那样</a>，“无论他承认与否，阿尔丁的歌曲和一名少年被谋杀的法院都提醒人们，从历史上看，诉诸所谓的法律和秩序往往既依赖于正式的法律程序，也依赖于白人的自卫行为。”<br><br>最重要的是，阿尔丁的歌曲捕捉到了右翼被围困的感觉。它在流行文化中反映出共和党基础中同样的好斗情绪，自特朗普 2020 年失败以来，这种好斗情绪鼓励全国各地的共和党领导人在几乎所有方面对民主党和自由派利益采取更激进的策略。<br><br>例如，田纳西州的共和党立法多数派<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/04/tennessee-expulsions-republican-gop/673709/">驱逐了两名年轻的黑人民主党州代表</a>，蒙大拿州的共和党多数派谴责了一名跨性别民主党州代表，并禁止她参加会议。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/12/republican-states-rights-restrictions/621101/">共和党控制的州正在推进</a>煽动性政策，这些政策在几年前可能被认为是不可想象的， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/texass-immigration-policy-biden/674784/">比如德克萨斯州政府通过在边境安装刀片刺网和在格兰德河漂浮浮标来阻止移民的计划</a>。众议院议长凯文·麦卡锡提出弹劾乔·拜登的可能性。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/bud-light-boycott-consumer-effect/674446/">百威淡啤仅仅因为与跨性别影响者合作</a>开展促销项目而遭到抵制，这代表了右翼广泛反革命的另一个战线。特朗普在竞选中承诺进一步升级：他表示，如果连任，他将以前所未有的方式动员联邦权力，对保守派针对蓝色目标进行所谓的“报复”，例如，派遣国民警卫队进入民主党——管理城市打击犯罪，推行大规模的无证移民驱逐计划，并公开部署司法部来对付他的政治对手。<br><br>道德与公共政策中心的布朗指出，尽管州和国家层面的共和党人都在推动这一令人毛骨悚然的议程，但他们认为自己并不是在发动一场文化战争，而是在回应媒体自由派针对他们发起的一场文化战争。 、学术界、大公司和倡导团体。他说，共和党人的主流观点是“我们正试图在这里采取防御行动。我们没有侵略；我们正在受到侵略。”<br><br>在不断发展的美国，对被流离失所的恐惧已经成为激励共和党选民的最强大力量<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/the-coalition-of-transformation-vs-the-coalition-of-restoration/265512/">——我称之为</a>“复辟联盟”。从政治生涯一开始，特朗普就瞄准了这种感觉<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/trumps-rhetoric-of-white-nostalgia/485192/">，承诺“让美国<i>再次伟大”。</i>阿尔丁</a>同样回顾了他对美国未来的愿景， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://people.com/jason-aldean-stands-by-controversial-song-during-ohio-tour-stop-7564414">在一场音乐会上为他的歌曲辩护，表达了</a>他希望看到美国“在所有这些废话开始发生在我们身上之前，恢复到原来的样子”。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/working-class-white-voters-gop-house-agenda/673500/">阅读：工人阶级白人选民如何成为共和党的基础</a><br><br>正如布朗指出的那样，2024 年共和党总统竞选已经成为一场谁最致力于与左翼斗争、挖掘失去的美国的竞争。阿尔丁的歌曲和视频有助于解释原因。他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/06/red-and-blue-state-divide-is-growing-michael-podhorzer-newsletter/661377/">为该国红蓝阵营之间日益加深的冷战</a>写了一首战斗进行曲。在他的讲述中，就像特朗普一样，传统上保守的美国白人正受到社会力量的威胁，这些力量将抹去他们的生活方式。对于蓝色美国来说，阿尔丁描述的进程代表着一场早该进行的重新谈判，因为少数族裔和 LGBTQ 群体等先前被边缘化的群体需要更多的影响力和包容性。在《红色美国》中，他描述了一种需要无条件抵抗的生存威胁。<br><br>民意调查显示，尽管针对特朗普的可信刑事指控不断增加，但大多数共和党人正在通过在 2024 年提名竞选中再次团结起来支持特朗普来应对这一威胁。但《在小镇尝试一下》的真正信息是，无论特朗普个人发生什么，共和党联盟中的大多数选民几乎肯定会继续要求领导人，就像阿尔丁所说的“从小培养的好男孩”一样，他们渴望着与他们认为危及世界的一切事物作斗争。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 16:02:00

class="smallcaps">为人父母总是充满不可预测性</span>：凌晨两点醒来、学校打来电话、那些让<em>我胃痛的</em>可怕话语。这种日常差异通常源于生病或受惊的孩子，并且是家庭生活基本动态的一部分。然而，今天的美国父母也面临着日益严重的外部干扰和旨在提供稳定的机构的退化。其结果是，许多家庭经常会因为一些问题而陷入困境，这些问题不仅仅是不方便，但还不是灾难性的。这会滋生父母的压力、不安全感和疲惫。简而言之，美国人已经进入了一个颤抖的时代。<br><br>过去半个世纪以来，这个国家一直在走这条道路。从 20 世纪 70 年代开始，一系列经济和社会政策决策导致了政治学家雅各布·哈克 (Jacob Hacker) 所说的从政府和企业到家庭的“ <a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/01/summer-day-camps-activities-childcare/672837/">夏令营</a>等基本服务，而且他们在很大程度上依靠自己来应对任何故障。<br><br> <a

Additionally, as the labor economist Aaron Sojourner told me, there has been a significant rise of “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/Scheduling_Hourly_Workers_Demos.pdf">just-in-time scheduling</a> ”—a model where businesses operate with the barest minimum of employees who can be called in or sent home on very short notice—in low-wage industries including retail, food service, and call centers. This leads to instability in the lives of workers, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rsfjournal.org/content/8/5/24.abstract">especially parents</a> , and increases the risk of something going awry for customers if a sole employee quits or cannot make their shift. Yet <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hrdive.com/news/a-running-list-of-states-and-localities-with-predictive-scheduling-mandates/540835/">only one state and a few cities</a> have laws limiting just-in-time scheduling.<br><br> At the same time, decades of neglect are causing public systems to break down. A lack of adequate funding and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/recoding-america-why-government-is-failing-in-the-digital-age-and-how-we-can-do-better-jennifer-pahlka/9781250266774?affiliate_id=atl-347">modernized processes</a> has led to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.baltimorebrew.com/2023/07/18/three-public-pools-have-yet-to-open-in-baltimore-hanging-residents-out-to-dry/">decaying public services</a> and hollowed-out government offices with poor responsiveness. Applications for child-care assistance <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kcur.org/politics-elections-and-government/2023-05-10/missouri-families-cant-get-help-affording-child-care-because-of-bureaucratic-hurdles">can be a nightmare to complete</a> , and even well-resourced states like New York and Illinois have recently had major problems getting <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wgntv.com/news/illinois/some-childcare-providers-forced-to-close-after-not-getting-paychecks-from-state/">timely payments to child-care providers</a> . Parents of children with disabilities are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnet.com/personal-finance/social-security-disability-claims-wait-record-high-how-to-avoid-delays/">facing down</a> record-long application-processing times and extremely limited support staff.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">The age of tremors helps explain</span> a seemingly odd disconnect between people&#39;s perceptions of their personal lives and of the way the country is going. <em>The Atlantic</em> ’s Derek Thompson <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/american-economy-negative-perception-inflation/661149/">described this phenomenon</a> as “Everything is terrible, but I&#39;m fine,” pointing to the tension between contemporary indicators such as healthy disposable income and a sense of economic gloom. For many parents, I might extend the description to “Everything is terrible; I&#39;m holding on, but what&#39;s going to go wrong next?”<br><br> Psychologists are clear that a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psychcentral.com/stress/stress-and-the-concept-of-control">reasonable sense of control</a> is a key component of mental health. Having to worry about Canadian wind directions or scouring a half dozen stores for medicine to bring down your child&#39;s fever are not only practical pain points; they foster a general atmosphere of instability. Some parents of young children <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/17/health/formula-shortage-one-year-later/index.html">still reported lingering fear and anxiety</a> about formula supply after shelves were filled again.<br><br> Such constant precarity takes an emotional toll regardless of one&#39;s bank account. Research shows <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2789946">significant declines in parents&#39; mental health</a> since before the pandemic, and recent years have brought <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/05/well/family/parental-burnout-symptoms.html">high levels of parental exhaustion and burnout</a> , as well as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsroom.thecignagroup.com/loneliness-epidemic-persists-post-pandemic-look">loneliness</a> . About three-quarters of parents are very or somewhat concerned that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.capita.org/thinkofthechildren">climate change will harm their children</a> or other young children they know. This stress and insecurity can easily <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Tumbleweed-Society-Working-Caring-Insecurity/dp/0199957711?asin=0199957711&amp;revisionId=&amp;format=4&amp;depth=1">trickle down</a> to the whole family.<br><br> A simple rejoinder is that none of this is new. Parents a century ago could not count on antibiotics because they were not commercially available. But consider the more recent past: Today&#39;s parents have less predictability than those in the last quarter of the 20th century. As the Stanford sociologist Marianne Cooper wrote in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/cut-adrift-families-in-insecure-times-marianne-cooper/9780520277670?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Cut Adrift: Families in Insecure Times</em></a> , the trends that began at the time of the great risk shift brought about substantial increases in income and job instability by the 2000s.<br><br> Moreover, until the past few decades, social institutions and bonds have been better prepared to stand in the gap. Labor unions, fraternal associations, and especially <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/religion-affiliation-community.html">faith communities</a> provide not merely a sense of connectivity but also material support such as meals after a birth or trusted people who can watch the kids in a pinch. These networks have been experiencing a steady decline in membership.<br><br> A permanent age of tremors is not, however, inevitable. Policy makers can both stabilize the ground and help families deal with the quakes. The first step is making healthy, predictable family life a policy priority. Laws that strengthen the child-care system, provide robust paid leave, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/17/irs-phone-wait-times-taxes/">reinvest in public services</a> and lower <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/how-government-learned-waste-your-time-tax/619568/">their administrative burdens</a> , and restrict just-in-time scheduling are all ways to shift risks from families back onto government and corporations. As a guiding principle, policy makers should reduce chaos, liberating parents and children to deepen their connections to one another and their community.<br><br> Perhaps the saddest thing about the status quo is that this should be an age of wonders for families. We live in an era when modern medicine has eliminated many childhood diseases and is regularly developing new <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/fda-approves-rsv-injection-infants-rcna94698">treatments</a> . There has been a resurgence of interest in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/07/raising-kid-american-city/661506/">developing child-friendly communities</a> that can withstand climate disruption by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tpl.org/parks-address-climate-change-report">expanding and upgrading parks</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/2023/06/30/future-of-the-playground/">creating more natural playgrounds</a> . Technological tools make connecting with loved ones in far-flung parts of the country easier than ever. Parents could have so much to enjoy and look forward to—if they weren&#39;t constantly bracing for the next shake.<br><br> <small><em>​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

He insists that his children, who are growing up in New York City right now, are a lot less safe than we were as kids in the same neighborhood. I happen to know this is absurd, and I&#39;ve tried for many years to convince him. I&#39;ve shown him news reports, crime statistics. Once I even downloaded an FBI report showing without a doubt that New York was much more dangerous 30 years ago. But he is unmoved. He remembers our childhood as gentler, safer. And I have to admit—there are moments when I walk around my old neighborhood and see visions of the mailman tipping his hat to my 10-year-old self, and the neighbors smiling as I made my way home to dinner.<br><br> Why do so many of us have this feeling that when we were younger, people were nicer and more moral, and took care of one another better? An experimental psychologist named Adam Mastroianni had also been wondering about this persistent conviction and did a systematic study of the phenomenon recently published in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06137-x"><em>Nature</em></a> .<br><br> Mastroianni documents that this hazy memory is shared by many different demographics, and felt quite strongly. He explains how the illusion works and why it has such a hold on us. And most important, he explains how it can distort not just our personal relationships but our culture and politics. In this episode of <em>Radio Atlantic</em> , I talk with Mastroianni and staff writer Julie Beck about the illusion of moral decline, and why it persists so strongly.<br><br> <em>W</em> <em>henever politicians or aspiring politicians make the claim that, you know, “Things used to be better, put me in charge and I&#39;ll make them better again”—that&#39;s a very old thing that we&#39;ve heard many times. And it resonates with us, perhaps because we are primed to believe it, even when it&#39;s not true.</em><br><br> Listen to the conversation here: <br><br><iframe class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.megaphone.fm/ATL9319336197" frameborder="no" height="200" scrolling="no" title="嵌入互动内容" width="100%" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe> <em>Subscribe here:</em> <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/radio-atlantic/id1258635512"><em>Apple Podcasts</em></a> <em>|</em> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4PgNKjRJJWlaV6zuNr69BO"><em>Spotify</em></a> <em>|</em> <a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/radio-atlantic"><em>Stitcher</em></a> <em>|</em> <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vcmFkaW9hdGxhbnRpYw"><em>Google Podcasts</em></a> <em>|</em> <a href="https://pca.st/ccxU"><em>Pocket Casts</em></a> <strong><em>The following episode transcript has been edited lightly for clarity:</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Hanna Rosin:</strong> So, Julie, you know—even though I get annoyed when other people say people used to be nicer, I kind of think I might feel that way too.<br><br> If I have a vision of my childhood and I&#39;m walking down the street from the playground, I imagine all my neighbors saying, “Hi, little Hanna.” [ <em>Laughter</em> .] And the mailman coming by, you know, and tipping his hat at me, and the old man walking his dog.<br><br> And, you know, I have no idea if this memory is accurate, but I definitely have that feeling that people were nicer.<br><br> <strong>Julie Beck:</strong> Did you grow up in <em>Mister Rogers&#39; Neighborhood</em> ? Or what was it?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> No; I actually grew up in Queens, New York. So it&#39;s probably, certainly not true. [ <em>Laughter.</em> ]<br><br> This is <em>Radio Atlantic</em> . I&#39;m Hanna Rosin. I invited my colleague Julie Beck on to talk about something that&#39;s always really bothered me. It&#39;s when people talk about how things are so much worse today than they were in the past.<br><br> And they say things like “Neighbors used to be nicer, and everyone used to smile at you and help you out.” And sometimes it&#39;s just grandpa chatter and you can pretty much ignore it. And then other times it turns into this “back when men were men and women were women”–type thing, which is more annoying.<br><br> <strong><em>Beck:</em></strong> <em>There&#39;s a benign wish to, like, tip your hat to the mailman. And then there&#39;s a “Oh, we need to bring back the social order of the 1950s.” And then you&#39;re like, “Whoa, how did we end up here?”</em><br><br> Julie analyzes psychological research and social trends, and she&#39;s also the host of another Atlantic podcast, <em>How to Talk to People</em> .<br><br> And she&#39;s here to help me understand this very interesting research that just emerged about this strong conviction people have that everything has gotten worse.<br><br> <strong><em>Adam Mastroianni</em></strong> <strong>:</strong> <em>So my whole life, I&#39;ve heard people say things like, “You used to be able to keep your doors unlocked at night,” or “You can&#39;t trust someone&#39;s word anymore.”</em><br><br> <em>And I always chafed at those kinds of statements. So part of it was wanting to prove everybody wrong. But part of it, too, was like,</em> Well, if they&#39;re right, this is a big problem. <em>And that&#39;s kind of where we got started.</em><br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> That is Adam Mastroianni. He recently published a paper in <em>Nature</em> called “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-illusion-of-moral-decline">The Illusion of Moral Decline</a> .” Adam is a psychologist, and he&#39;s the author of the science blog <em>Experimental History.</em> And he spent a decade systematically studying why we feel things were better in the past … and what it means.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> I think my first year of graduate school was when Trump got elected. And so obviously it was a moment of “Make America Great Again” being sort of the vibe of the day.<br><br> Seeing claims that “The past was good, the present is bad, put me in charge and I can bring the good past back” also just made me see how this is much more than, you know, uncles and brothers-in-law and people on the internet saying these things— that these claims resonate with people, and they help put people in the Oval Office.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. I mean, I have to say, that&#39;s my motivation for being interested in your research, because I have always had a kind of detached curiosity about why this line resonates so strongly.<br><br> Like, why is it that—and it&#39;s not just American leaders, it&#39;s leaders all over the world—they can just say, “Oh, things were better back then,” and it immediately clicks for people? Like, they don&#39;t even have to explain it. You can just say, “You know, make America great again.” It&#39;s like four words, and all the assumptions are immediately there for people.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah. When I give talks in an academic context about this paper, what I start with is the end of Trump&#39;s inaugural speech, where he says, “You know, we&#39;ll make America wealthy again and proud again and safe again and great again.” And I point out that the most important word in those sentences isn&#39;t <em>America</em> or <em>safe</em> or <em>proud</em> or <em>strong</em> or <em>great</em> . It&#39;s <em>again</em> .<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yes!<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Just that word does a ton of work. Which is that: Well, if things used to be great but aren&#39;t now, it means something changed. It implies that we can change it back. It evokes a sense of loss, but also a sense of possibility of restoring the loss.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. And it is the word <em>again</em> . It&#39;s like that one little word sort of resolves something emotionally for people. It&#39;s hard to understand exactly how it works, but you say the word <em>again</em> , and everyone&#39;s like, “Ah, you just filled a hole for me.”你知道？ What exactly do you mean when you say “moral decline,” and why, if it&#39;s an illusion, does it feel so real?<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> There are a few totally reasonable hypotheses about what people might think of when they talk about moral decline. It might be that everyone means, like, “I heard that the 1950s were a really good time. And so what I&#39;m really telling you is things have declined since then.” Not that they got worse in the past 10 years; that they got worse, you know, 20 years ago or 50 years ago. And we&#39;re just living in the bad times now.<br><br> In a later study, we asked people go back even further than that. “What about 20 years before that? What about 40 years before that?” And what they told us there is—“Before I arrived, nothing was happening. Things were good. Then I got born, and then things started to go downhill.”<br><br> And what&#39;s especially interesting is: It doesn&#39;t matter when you were born. So the people who were 30 told us it happened 30 years ago. The people who were 60 told us it happened 60 years ago.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Wait, really? So literally, people think the decline began when they came on this earth?<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah. So, I mean, we don&#39;t ask, like, the day before or the day after. But the question that we asked was: “Rate how kind, honest, nice, and good people are today. What about the year in which you were 20?” And people told us it was better then.<br><br> “What about the year in which you were born?” And people told us it was even better then. And then we asked, “What about 20 years before that? And 40 years before that?”<br><br> And there&#39;s no difference in people&#39;s answers. That line is flat. It&#39;s only when we asked about “20 years after your birth” that the line goes down.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> That is so interesting. I don&#39;t think I fully grasped that. So people are projecting whatever personal difficulties or struggles of life—now maybe I&#39;m extrapolating—onto the whole of humanity, like they&#39;re protecting their own life span onto a historical, broader cultural, political life span.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah. And I mean, this is a bias of people&#39;s memory, because you don&#39;t have memories from before you were born. You do have memories from most of the time after you were born.<br><br> So it would make sense—if this is a memory bias—that it turns on sometime near the moment of your birth. Obviously not exactly then, but this would explain why we don&#39;t see this for what people think about before they were born and after.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Does it really not matter how young you are? The stereotype is obviously, you know, Grandpa Simpson. It&#39;s like, older people are always talking about how things were better back then, but not necessarily younger people.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah; we totally expected to find that as well, and we didn&#39;t really. So when you ask people about the decline that they have perceived over their lifetimes, there&#39;s no difference in the decline that younger and older people perceive.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Julie, I was surprised to hear that there wasn&#39;t a difference between older people and younger people in terms of how they perceive this moral decline. I mean, you&#39;re not an old person; you&#39;re young. So do you remember ever having this feeling?<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> I distinctly remember I did not get a smartphone until I moved to DC in 2013. So in the years before that, when I lived in Chicago, I have a memory of having so many more interactions with strangers on the street.<br><br> And I definitely do not have those nearly as frequently anymore. And I think it&#39;s just because we&#39;re all looking at our phones, right? So part of me kind of romanticizes the, you know, chance encounters of the pre-smartphone era and all of that.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. And when I hear you say that, I&#39;m like, <em>Oh, it&#39;s fine for Julie to have that feeling, and it&#39;s fine for me to have that feeling.</em> But if I multiply it by a few million times, then I get this political movement of “Let&#39;s go back to the era when things were better,” and that I don&#39;t really like so much.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Yeah. One thing that this makes me think of, too, is a line of research that has found that social trust has actually been declining in the US for decades. So people are essentially less and less likely to say that generally most other people can be trusted.<br><br> And so you&#39;re totally right that there are really big political implications for thinking the past was better and people used to be more trustworthy.<br><br> For me, it feels like kind of a chicken-or-an-egg question. Like, do we trust people less because we believe they&#39;ve gotten morally worse? Or do we believe people are worse because we&#39;re more disconnected from our communities?<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> We focused here on a pretty narrow question, which is, “Has the way that people treat one another in their everyday lives changed over time?” And do people think that it has?<br><br> This is a model of when things are bad, it&#39;s easy for them to seem like they have gotten worse. And so I don&#39;t think this is the only domain where we might find this illusion, because people say this about a lot of different parts of life.<br><br> You know: that art is worse than it used to be. That culture is worse than it used to be. That the education system is worse than it used to be. But it seems pretty clear to me that we are predisposed to believe that it&#39;s true, even when it&#39;s not.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Your assumptions in this research are—people have this idea that a certain kind of morality has declined. But in your mind, it has not declined. So to you, this is like an illusion. I mean, you call it an illusion.正确的？<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yes.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Okay. So working within that assumption, what&#39;s your explanation? Like, why would a majority of us be operating under a delusion/illusion? Like something that <em>you&#39;re</em> saying is clearly not true.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> We think that there are two cognitive biases that can combine to produce this illusion. So this explanation has two parts. The first is what we call biased exposure, which is that people tend to attend to predominantly negative information, especially about people that they don&#39;t know.<br><br> So this is both a combination of the information that they receive about people that they don&#39;t know, which is primarily negative, and the information that they pay attention to. So this is why when you look out at the world beyond your personal world, it looks like it&#39;s full of people who are doing bad things. They&#39;re lying and cheating and stealing and killing.<br><br> The second part of the explanation is what we call biased memory. Memory researchers have noticed that the badness of bad memories tends to fade faster than the goodness of good memories.<br><br> So if you got turned down for your high-school prom, it feels pretty bad at the time. Twenty years later, it&#39;s maybe a funny story. If you have a great high-school prom, it feels pretty good at the time. And 20 years later, it&#39;s still a pretty nice memory. It doesn&#39;t feel as nice as it did to experience it, but it still feels pretty nice.<br><br> And that turns out to be, on average, what happens to people&#39;s memories: that the bad ones inch toward neutral faster than the good ones do, And the bad ones are more likely to both be forgotten and to become good in retrospect.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> So when I read the paper, Hanna, I wondered whether what might be going on is that people are, to some degree, picking up on a real change in the world.<br><br> There&#39;s the decline of social trust—but also widespread loneliness and disconnection and the erosion of community life, in the sense of fewer people knowing their neighbors and declining membership in community organizations.<br><br> And all of those things definitely have an impact on people&#39;s personal lives. But I think it manifests as a vague feeling like, <em>Oh, it&#39;s just harder to make friends or harder to feel like I&#39;m a part of my community.</em><br><br> So I wonder if we&#39;re feeling this sort of vague and troubling sense of disconnection and assigning it a false explanation: that things used to be better before, and people just suck more than they used to.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s really interesting. So what you&#39;re saying is the feeling is real. Like, the feeling that something has changed is real because something <em>has</em> changed. There is more disconnection and loneliness.<br><br> So instead we make up this very tidy story. Like, “When I was a kid, things were better and people were nicer and the mailman tipped his hat”—and we just kind of stopped there.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Yeah; there definitely are real things that are really happening that would make people feel disconnected from strangers around them. And I wonder if, yeah, we just have a hard time psychologically, knowing why that&#39;s the case.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So Adam, I want to run a couple of theories by you. One is the possibility that something has actually changed. And we&#39;re just calling it by the wrong name. That, like, something has declined. And this is from a different body of psychological research about social trust.<br><br> That there is a change in our isolation, our sense of connectedness, our face-to-ace contact. Like there are some societal changes which are real and structural and have kind of left a hole in us that we are misnaming <em>morality</em> .<br><br> When we read it here, we thought there are some things that are changing and that do leave us a little despairing—and maybe we&#39;re just calling them by the wrong name.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Like we have this incredibly powerful feeling that something is wrong, and that “something” is connectedness or community or something like that.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah. So it&#39;s very easy to slip from “People are less kind than they used to be” to <em>“Things</em> are worse than they used to be.” And so it is true that trust in institutions has declined over time. A lot of people also say that interpersonal trust has declined over time. And I actually think that case is much more overstated than the decline in institutional trust.<br><br> There&#39;s some work by a guy named Richard Eibach on how people think the world has gotten more dangerous. And he finds that people believe this. And the people who believe this, especially, are parents. And when you ask those parents “When did the world become more dangerous?,” you get a date that is curiously close to the date of the birth of their first child.<br><br> The obvious implication being that nothing about the world changed. It was your worldview that changed. And now you have to, you know, protect this fragile life—and so you are much more attuned to the dangers of the world. That&#39;s why you think there&#39;s more of them.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> You know, Julie, I have this conversation with my brother all the time, and he&#39;s always telling me his kids aren&#39;t safe. He lives in New York. He&#39;s like, “My kids aren&#39;t safe. They can&#39;t go outside. They can&#39;t go down the block.” Like, he really freaks out, you know? And: “It&#39;s way less safe than it was when we were kids.” And I&#39;m like, “Dude, we grew up in New York in the &#39;70s, right?” It was really not safe.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Like, statistically.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Statistically. And I&#39;ve shown him news articles, and I once pulled out an FBI report. I specially downloaded an FBI report that showed, you know, crime statistics in New York from when we were kids.<br><br> And his conviction is so strong about this. I can&#39;t budge him. I can&#39;t show him enough numbers or statistics to make him think, <em>Oh, things aren&#39;t worse now</em> .<br><br> I mean, Adam Mastroianni actually has a term for this. This is a little mean to my brother, but his term is <em>unearned conviction</em> . And I think what he means by that is exactly this. It&#39;s like: Your conviction is incredibly strong, even though you have really no basis to back up the story that you&#39;re attaching to that very strong conviction.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Yeah. I mean it seems like, regardless of the FBI report, the story your brother is telling himself is super-emotionally resonant.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yes.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> And the stories that we tell ourselves about our own lives really do sort of shape who we are. It&#39;s really interesting, because when we tell these stories to ourselves about our personal lives, a lot of times those stories fall into one of two categories. One being redemptive and the other being contamination.<br><br> And so a redemptive story is like: “I have suffered through these trials and come out stronger for it, and things are looking up.” Whereas a contamination story is like: “These trials have conquered me, and I am now broken and fundamentally a worse person.”<br><br> And it probably won&#39;t surprise you to hear that contamination sequences are not great for people&#39;s mental health. That research was done with stories that we&#39;re telling about our personal lives. But it feels like we&#39;re kind of telling a contamination story about all of humanity.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I guess what&#39;s depressing to me is: Why are those the ones that stick? I mean, there are redemption stories that are popular in American society.<br><br> But I feel like in a lot of moments in history, and now is one of them, these contamination stories—like “America was great once” or “Russia was great once”—have a particular kind of emotional juice and can really rally people.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Yeah. I mean, maybe it&#39;s kind of like your brother&#39;s fear in New York, right? Where it&#39;s just like—that is so viscerally emotional. It&#39;s the safety of your kid. And so, of course, that&#39;s going to have like a way stronger impact.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Now Adam, did you find any appreciable differences between demographics? So if not between old and young people, what about gender differences, or people with different political ideologies?<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> We didn&#39;t find any gender differences. We didn&#39;t find any differences by racial groups. We didn&#39;t find any education differences. The only other demographic difference that we found was an ideological one, a political one. The people who self-identified as more conservative perceived more decline over time than the people who self-identified as liberal.<br><br> But even for the people who were the most liberal, they still said that people are less kind today than they were 10 years ago, 20 years ago, or whatever point in the past. So this is something that conservatives said louder, but liberals said as well.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So someone who identifies as a liberal could believe that there&#39;s less racism and sexism—but still believe that those other general universal markers of morality have declined.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yes. And in fact, it seems like they do. In our studies, the much smaller group of people who say that people are better now than they used to be—when we asked them “Why? What were you thinking of?,” one thing that does come up for them is there&#39;s more tolerance. There&#39;s less racism, sexism, ableism; all the <em>isms</em> .<br><br> So it seems like that&#39;s not what people are spontaneously thinking of when they say that people are less kind than they used to be. Because if you ask them directly, “Do you think that, for instance, people treat African Americans with more respect and courtesy or less than in the past?,” a majority of people will say more today than in the past.<br><br> But if you ask them, “Are people more or less kind today?,” they&#39;ll go less kind. So this is not what they&#39;re thinking of when they answer the question.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. So it&#39;s a really, really specific feeling. I definitely think that people treat each other with more respect, largely because we have broadened the window of who is allowed to be respected, and sort of patriarchal notions of control over people&#39;s bodies and who gets to make decisions. I mean, there&#39;s so many ways in which we have opened the door to fairness and equity. I&#39;d much rather be alive today than 50 years ago, for sure.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah, I agree. And so I think it was especially surprising that I&#39;m sure there are many other people who agree. But even some of the people who do agree—they seem to think like, <em>Yeah, but that actually doesn&#39;t come from people&#39;s heart of hearts</em> . That they&#39;re actually still worse to one another now than they used to be.<br><br> Yeah; they&#39;ll say all the right things or they&#39;ll have the right opinions. But you know, they won&#39;t hold the door open for you, or they&#39;ll cheat you when they can. Now people know the right things to say, but they still <em>do</em> more of the bad things.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Do we feel the same way with people we know? Does it play out differently in our personal lives?<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> You can actually also produce an illusion of improvement. You actually primarily hear good things and experience good things about people that you know. And so we thought that in your personal world, this illusion of decline might be turned down or turned off or even reversed.<br><br> And people told us: “People in general? Worse today than they were 15 years ago. People that I have known for the last 15 years? Better today than they were 15 years ago.”<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So Julie, one thing that Adam found that I thought was so interesting was that people we know—like our own people, people we&#39;re close to or whatever—they&#39;re somehow getting better over time, and yet the general public are getting worse. I don&#39;t quite understand how those fit together.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> So I guess we just think the moral decline is happening with strangers, with all those <em>other</em> people.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> And it seems like potentially the disconnection from community that many people are experiencing could just mean that we&#39;re slotting more people into the “morally compromised, untrustworthy” category.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right. Like, if we met more people and we had more casual acquaintances and we went to our bowling leagues or whatever, then we might include more people in that circle of people we know. And those people are good people. So that could sort of spiral upward rather than what&#39;s happening, which is a momentum downward.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Adam&#39;s study kind of seems to say that if you get to know people, then you won&#39;t think they&#39;re on a downward slope of moral depravity anymore.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> For one thing, Adam, it sounds to me like the problem is that people are absolutely certain. Like they&#39;re not questioning. Was the past a worse place? It&#39;s a sort of lack of humility. Because if you try to understand, “Well, maybe what did get worse?,” then you would come up with more specific and useful policy solutions.<br><br> I mean, I assume one reason you did this research is to point out a mistake. Like, we&#39;re all living under this delusion. And in your head—since you sound like a fairly optimistic person—is it “knowledge is power,” and people will know, and then they will stop? What&#39;s the aim, or what&#39;s your wish here?<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah. I mean, as a psychologist I a little bit despair of changing people&#39;s minds, because I know how difficult it is. It doesn&#39;t work the way that we think that it works, like, “Oh, you have the wrong model of the world. How about I give you the correct facts, and now you have the correct model of the world?” When does that ever happen? When has that ever happened to me? Like, never.<br><br> And one effect that I certainly hope that this has is: Whenever politicians or aspiring politicians make the claim that, you know, “Things used to be better, and put me in charge and I&#39;ll make them better again”—that&#39;s a very old thing that we&#39;ve heard many times. And it resonates with us, perhaps because we are primed to believe it, even when it&#39;s not true.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> So, Hanna, now that we know this is an illusion, right, that&#39;s very interesting. But will it actually change how you feel?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I don&#39;t really know. I mean, I feel like as a journalist, it depresses me a little bit because I spent a lot of time researching and marshaling facts, like I did with my brother. And to think that emotions ultimately squash all of that—I don&#39;t really know what to do with that.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Yeah.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> But in my own personal life, awareness is helpful. I don&#39;t think any bad can come from understanding your own emotional levers better. It&#39;s not that it immediately leads to a change, but I don&#39;t think it can ever be bad to understand, <em>Oh, I&#39;m having this emotional attachment or strong belief, and that&#39;s leading me to behave in this way.</em> That in and of itself is a small daily miracle. So that&#39;s good enough.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> <em>Listeners, if you enjoyed this conversation with Adam Mastroianni and Julie Beck, and if you generally like learning about these psychological levers that are guiding our choices, Julie hosts a full season of conversations much like this one, on the Atlantic podcast</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/how-to-build-a-happy-life/">How to Talk to People</a> . <em>You can find it wherever you listen to podcasts.</em><br><br> This episode was produced by Becca Rashid.

Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> No one <em>deserves</em> a seat at Harvard, but only some people are supposed to feel bad about the one they get.<br><br> Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that race-based affirmative action violated the equal-protection clause, spurring a news cycle about the admissions advantages conferred on certain people of color. The preferential admissions treatment that racial minorities received is just one bonus among many, however. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">new study</a> from the economic research group Opportunity Insights quantifies the advantages of wealth in higher education: The ultra rich are much likelier to gain admission to elite colleges than anyone else, even when controlling for academic success. Put another way, if you take a room full of 18-year-olds with the same SAT or ACT score, those from the top 1 percent are 55 percent more likely to be admitted than middle-class applicants. Those from the top 0.1 percent are 150 percent more likely to get in.<br><br> For decades, underrepresented minorities have faced accusations of unearned access. The implication of these resentments has always been that some people who deserve to go to Harvard have had their spots “taken” by Black, Latino, and Native American students who, absent efforts to tip the scales in their favor, would never have been granted admission. But no one “deserves” to gain admission anywhere. No university can construct a perfectly meritocratic system. How should an admissions program distinguish among tens of thousands of standout students fairly? Is publishing a best-selling novel more important than a perfect GPA? If a student with a mediocre GPA but a perfect SAT score explains their academic deficiency by pointing out that they were taking care of their sick parent, is it reasonable for an admissions officer to consider them more “meritorious” than a student with perfect grades <em>and</em> scores?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Annie Lowrey: Why you have to care about these 12 colleges</a><br><br> Any method of distinguishing among such applicants is inherently subjective, and any of the traits, acquired skills, or backgrounds that help push students over the edge could be considered “unearned advantage.” But none of those carries the stigma that race-based affirmative action does. The whispers of affirmative action never leave the people of color who enter into elite spaces; they become the targets of resentment for the unfulfilled ambitions of their fellow students and, later on, their colleagues.<br><br> A 1995 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/affirm/stories/aa032495.htm">dispatch</a> from <em>The Washington Post</em> highlights these resentments: “They talk about a glass ceiling for women and minorities. There&#39;s a glass ceiling for middle-aged white male managers too,” a 52-year-old worker living in Georgia tells the reporters. Another man aptly addresses the zero-sum nature of the conflict: “Why should I suffer so they can have a better chance in jobs or anything for that matter.”<br><br> Or take this monologue from <em>The West Wing</em> ’s CJ Cregg about why she&#39;s “the wrong Democrat” to defend affirmative action: “After my father fought in Korea, he became what this government begs every college graduate to become. He became a teacher. And he raised a family on a teacher&#39;s salary, and he paid his taxes and always crossed at the green. And any time there was an opportunity for career advancement, it took him an extra five years because invariably there was a less qualified Black woman in the picture. So instead of retiring as superintendent of the Ohio Valley Union Free School District, he retired head of the math department at William Henry Harrison Junior High.”<br><br> CJ thinks her father hit a glass ceiling put in place by a “less qualified Black woman,” a common villain in these stories of stunted careers.<br><br> Affirmative action is an albatross, whereas other forms of unearned privilege are, if anything, a sign of belonging. Most legacy kids don&#39;t try to hide their ancestral claims; they are proud of them, and so are their parents, who come to campus decked in university apparel. A Class of &#39;87 cap screams status far more loudly than an earnest “Proud Parent of …” T-shirt. Nor do the kids who row crew or play lacrosse conceal their participation in these résumé-padding pastimes. Later on in life, they eagerly share that they once rowed for Stanford.<br><br> This isn&#39;t just about the top 1 percent or even 10 percent. In a system that requires subjective discrimination, <em>no one</em> is objectively best qualified. Men have a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/30/achieving-perfect-gender-balance-on-campus-isnt-that-important-ending-private-colleges-affirmative-action-for-men-is/">much easier time getting into elite schools than women.</a> According to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/3/26/regional-diversity-scrutiny/"><em>The Harvard Crimson</em></a> , 51.5 percent of the noninternational students in the class of 2018 came from New York, New Jersey, California, or Massachusetts. Living in the United States is a form of unearned privilege as well; a genius in Ethiopia is less likely than the rich failson of an American lawyer to gain admission to one of our universities. It is perfectly legitimate for Americans to want our institutions to discriminate in our favor, but let&#39;s not pretend, then, that this is some fine-tuned exercise in picking the best and the brightest. The point is that we accept some forms of unearned advantage but not others. Born the son of a Harvard-educated lawyer who lives in Massachusetts? Fine. Born Black? Unacceptable.<br><br> In 2022, the linguist John McWhorter, who opposes both racial and legacy preferences in admissions processes, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/01/opinion/affirmative-action.html">wrote</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> that “however unfair it may be, legacy admissions do not reflect on white students or white people, broadly speaking, in the same way [as affirmative action does on Black people].” McWhorter skips right over <em>why</em> even as he refers to legacy preferences as an “embarrassment” for universities.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/ban-legacy-college-admissions-nepotism/629566/">Richard V. Reeves: The shame deficit</a><br><br> But preferential treatment for legacies and the elite isn&#39;t embarrassing. The reason race-based affirmative action is not treated the same way as all of the other unearned advantages is because of the presumption that racial minorities don&#39;t belong in elite spaces. Elite people belong at Ivies. So do men. So do Americans. So do people who play water polo. So do flute players and the children of alumni. The unearned advantages we accept are the ones we have already decided are acceptable characteristics of the elite.<br><br> Could the Supreme Court&#39;s decision finally convince the general public that the Black students who <em>are</em> admitted belong?我对此表示怀疑。 Jon Wang is one of the students who joined the plaintiffs in their successful effort to end race-conscious admissions. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/asian-american-student-claims-affirmative-action-prevented-his-admissions-but-california-law-doesnt-allow-that/">blames</a> affirmative action for his rejection from a number of schools. Among them: UC Berkeley. That university has been legally prohibited from considering race and ethnicity in admissions since the late 1990s, a change that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/affirmative-action-mismatch-and-economic-mobility-after-california%E2%80%99s-proposition-209">significantly drove down admissions</a> of underrepresented minorities across the University of California system.<br><br> The sooner we accept that no one <em>deserves</em> to be an elite, the better. Should a handful of private institutions benefiting from billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies and tax breaks and other public monies get to select our political, economic, and cultural leaders behind closed doors? Sure, it&#39;s better if they do so without employing harmful racial stereotypes. Better still if they stop putting their thumbs on the scale for the top 0.1 percent. But fighting over the appropriate racial composition of the future white-collar lawyers and corporate consultants of America only legitimizes the enterprise to begin with.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 13:45:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/harvard-admissions-affirmative-action-elite-colleges/674837/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/harvard-admissions-affirmative-action-elite-colleges/674837/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[‘It’s Really First-Class Work’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Watching <em>Oppenheimer</em> with Richard Rhodes, who wrote a definitive account of the Manhattan Project <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ila2DFKZYfKS9SJaSGJ3aKgB8OE=/0x83:1594x980/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/oppenheimer_inline_1/original.jpg" alt="希里安·墨菲 (Cillian Murphy) 在电影《奥本海默》中饰演 J·罗伯特·奥本海默" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Melinda Sue Gordon / Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure> <strong><em>This article containers spoilers for the film</em> Oppenheimer.</strong><br><br> Few authors have written as insightfully about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer as Richard Rhodes, whose 1986 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-richard-rhodes/9781451677614?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em></a> , is widely regarded as the definitive account of the Manhattan Project. Rhodes&#39;s comprehensive history, which won a Pulitzer Prize, is both a massive work of scholarship—the main text alone runs nearly 800 pages—and a literary feat that he conceived as “the tragic epic of the twentieth century.” Over the years, according to Rhodes, it has been optioned many times, but no film or television version has ever been made. “It&#39;s quite obvious why,” Rhodes told me. “It&#39;s just too big a story.”<br><br> Over the weekend, along with millions of other moviegoers, Rhodes saw <em>Oppenheimer</em> , Christopher Nolan&#39;s three-hour biopic of the physicist known as the father of the atomic bomb. The next day, curious about his reaction, I spoke with Rhodes by phone. He was deeply impressed by the film, especially in light of earlier attempts to adapt the same material. “It&#39;s really first-class work,” Rhodes said, comparing it favorably with Roland Joffé&#39;s <em>Fat Man and Little Boy</em> (“badly done,” from a technological perspective) and specifically praising Cillian Murphy&#39;s performance in the title role. “If anything, he was a little too confident. But Oppenheimer was pretty confident.”<br><br> We also discussed aspects of the story that weren&#39;t covered by the film, which Nolan adapted from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/books-briefing-kai-bird/674785/">the biography <em>American Prometheus</em></a> , by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Given its relentless concentration on Oppenheimer, the movie necessarily leaves a lot out, including plenty of what Rhodes called “drama on the industrial side” and the perspectives of scientists and victims who fall outside its protagonist&#39;s circle of consciousness. For the rest, viewers may need to return to Rhodes&#39;s own wide-ranging work, which expands beyond even the largest IMAX screen.<br><br><em>为了篇幅和清晰度，本次对话已被编辑。</em><br><br> <strong>Alec Nevala-Lee:</strong> Do you think that the film&#39;s picture of Oppenheimer is accurate?<br><br> <strong>Richard Rhodes:</strong> One time I asked [the physicist] Bob Serber if my portrait of Oppenheimer was anywhere close to the real human being. And Serber, who had a very dry wit, said, “It&#39;s the least wrong of all those I&#39;ve seen.”<br><br> And I think that applies here, because the difficult edges to Oppenheimer were, to some degree, sanded off. But there have been several Oppenheimers in past versions. The BBC did a series with Sam Waterston. He was wonderful, but he was much too nice. Then when the next version [the 2009 PBS docudrama <em>The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer</em> ] came around, [David Strathairn] played Oppenheimer as a hand-wringing neurotic, which really pissed me off when I watched it. You could not possibly have someone who did what Oppenheimer did in his life who was just sitting around shaking all the time with anxiety.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/">Read: <em>Oppenheimer</em> is more than a creation myth about the atomic bomb</a><br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Most viewers are probably encountering figures such as Lewis Strauss (the government official who orchestrated the notorious hearing that revoked Oppenheimer&#39;s security clearance, played by Robert Downey Jr. in a towering performance) and Leslie Groves (the military head of the atomic-weapons program, played by Matt Damon) for the first time.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> Yeah, I think Strauss, if anything, was depicted somewhat more pleasantly than he really was. I think he was even more nasty. And I was really surprised by Matt Damon, who did a damn good job. In fact, it gave me a different sort of perspective on Groves. I had pictured him as stuffier than he was depicted here, and I think this is probably closer to the truth. Groves was really a superb leader, and also anxious and insecure around the scientists. Which was a funny combination, because he drove them to get the job done anyway.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Was there anything else about the movie that surprised you?<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> Mostly minor things. I&#39;d read about the arrival of the shock wave after the light [from the Trinity test], but my God—when you see it in IMAX, it really hits you; it resonates in your chest. We were just knocked back in our chairs. I wish [Edward] Teller [Oppenheimer&#39;s nemesis in the debate over the hydrogen bomb] had been a little different. I spent an interesting 30 minutes with Teller and had some sense of what he was like. That guy [Benny Safdie] was a little too oily, not quite as sinister as Teller really was.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Nolan has always struck me as a pretty cerebral guy who also makes movies on the largest possible scale. It tracks to me that Oppenheimer, a theorist who found himself in charge of this incredible industrial operation, would appeal to him.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> That makes sense. My experience with writing books is, your best books are the ones that you have a deep emotional investment in. And there&#39;s an automatic tendency when you&#39;re writing a biography to turn the character in the biography into oneself.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Nolan, who is willing to play with structure, seems like a good choice for this story, because it allows him to deliver so much information. He can cut between the Manhattan Project period, the Oppenheimer hearing, and the hearing for Strauss&#39;s nomination as secretary of commerce, and use the dynamic to explain things to the audience.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> I had never thought about the parallel between Strauss and Oppenheimer before, but the story is structured so that both of them are destroyed by the forces of Washington, DC And that&#39;s really a wonderful sort of parallel. Oppenheimer&#39;s kind of a tragic hero, and I wouldn&#39;t give that credit to someone like Strauss. But in a kind of corrupt way, he followed the same arc across his life. That was a real insight that I haven&#39;t seen—maybe it&#39;s in the biography [ <em>American Prometheus</em> ].<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> I read it recently, and Strauss&#39;s hearing takes up just a single paragraph. But Nolan decides to make it a fifth of the movie, for the reasons you&#39;re saying. There&#39;s this fascinating parallel that is possible only in a movie—the thematic echoes and the rhythm of the editing provide a sense of closure that would be much more difficult in book form.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> You can do that, but you&#39;d have to have that insight. And Nolan had that insight. When you do research for a book, often you&#39;ll come across something that can be expanded upon. When I was working on <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> , I read a history of the development of physics in the United States. And in a footnote at the end of a chapter deep in the book, there&#39;s this note about [Enrico] Fermi, one day going up to the window and looking down at the gray winter length of Manhattan Island—alive with crowds—and cupping his hands together and saying, “A little bomb like that and it would all disappear.” The historian who wrote this book threw that away into a footnote. I made it the end of the whole first third of my book.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> The movie for the most part is very realistic, but dreamlike moments visualize Oppenheimer&#39;s psychological state, which reminded me of your book. The opening paragraph starts with the physicist Leo Szilard—whom you use in your book as a “clothesline” character, someone the audience can follow across a complex narrative—crossing the street, with a description of what the weather was like in London, and then it ends with a passage out of John Milton. And that elevates the tone in a way that tells you something about the material.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> That&#39;s what I was trying to do, of course. But I thought it was really off tone when [Nolan, in one of those dream sequences] had Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock screwing on the table in the security hearing. That was, I think, maybe a bit of an overreach. It&#39;s curious and interesting that they decided not to visit Hiroshima.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> I was wondering whether Nolan would show that, but every scene that&#39;s not about Strauss is from Oppenheimer&#39;s point of view. So instead of the bombing, you see him waiting for a phone call, because he has no control over how the weapon is used. There&#39;s an earlier scene where the characters talk about saving lives by heading off an American invasion of Japan. Is this something that would have been discussed before the bombing, or is this a rationalization that defenders of the decision arrived at after the fact?<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> Well, George Marshall [the US Army chief of staff during World War II] said we knew that the Japanese were getting their people trained to fight us. And we thought that if we could bomb the beaches with atomic bombs, we might shock the Japanese into surrender. In fact, there were plans to keep going. I found a memorandum from Oppenheimer to Groves saying if we make a design that uses both plutonium and uranium, we can have six bombs a month by October.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> If the movie had included that suggestion, it would have really changed the viewer&#39;s sense of Oppenheimer.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> There was also discussion in &#39;43 or &#39;44 of making radiation bombs stuffed with cobalt 60 or something that would just spread radioactive particles all over the place. We did some tests down in New Mexico, and I remember someone&#39;s comment afterward—it was the most god-awful stuff you could imagine. Which, yes, it would be, wouldn&#39;t it?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/richard-rhodes-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-ai/674777/">Read: The real lesson from <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em></a><br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> I recently watched the opera <em>Doctor Atomic</em> , where one character is Oppenheimer&#39;s Native American maid. That&#39;s the kind of voice you don&#39;t hear in the movie.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> It was certainly a valid perspective. These guys came in and swept the mesa clean, and they used the Native American people to clean their houses.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Nolan is so focused on Oppenheimer—but with a movie like this, you have to find, as you&#39;ve said, the clothesline.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> And there was so much drama on the industrial side that&#39;s basically just left out. It&#39;s compressed into something that is really very brilliant—those big open jars in which they keep dropping marbles [to track the supply of uranium and plutonium]. That&#39;s as close as we come to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/05/the-60-year-downfall-of-nuclear-power-in-the-us-has-left-a-huge-mess/560945/">seeing the Hanford complex</a> , with its huge production reactors, or the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-was-once-the-worlds-largest-building-has-now-been-completely-demolished/282549/">Oak Ridge complex</a> , with one factory that was [about] a mile long, so the supervisors inside rode around on bicycles.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> How do you feel about the impact this movie will have on how a mass audience understands this immensely complicated story?<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> I&#39;ve been living with this story now for 40, 50 years. So what I&#39;m most excited by—you will consider this crass, but this is where I am in my life—is we&#39;ve got an option from a German company for <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> to be made into a multipart television series. And I&#39;m just hoping that this will cause enough stir that these people will finally, for the first time in all these years, actually pick up the option. That would be just wonderful, and I&#39;d pay off my mortgage, and my version of the story would be out there.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 13:11:08 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-richard-rhodes-interview/674828/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-richard-rhodes-interview/674828/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel Has Already Lost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Israel hasn&#39;t destroyed its democracy yet.

But the reprieve was only temporary. At the time, the far-right ministers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/27/netanyahu-israeli-judicial-overhaul-suspend-protests">Itamar Ben-Gvir</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hes-delaying-overhaul-to-allow-dialogue-but-vows-reform-will-happen/">Bezalel Smotrich</a> assured supporters that the reforms would pass by late July.<br><br> This did not happen. Instead, on Monday, in the final week of the Israeli Parliament&#39;s summer session, the ruling coalition passed the least significant component of its proposed legislation: curtailing the Supreme Court&#39;s ability to use the “reasonableness standard” when reviewing government decisions. Contrary to the far right&#39;s pledge, the government did not enact its plan to subordinate the appointment of Supreme Court judges to politicians. Nor did it grant the coalition the ability to override judicial decisions.<br><br> In other words, Israel&#39;s democracy—flawed as it is—remains intact, for now. Far from incapacitated, the country&#39;s highest court is already <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-justices-rush-back-from-abroad-to-hear-petitions-against-reasonableness/">rushing</a> to convene an unprecedented session to rule on the legality of this week&#39;s effort to curb its powers. But whether or not Israel erodes its democratic guardrails in the months ahead, its people have already lost something similarly essential: basic social trust.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/israel-protests-netanyahu-judicial-systems-overhaul/673623/">Yair Rosenberg: The three biggest misconceptions about Israel&#39;s upheaval</a><br><br> Israel&#39;s warring camps are ostensibly fighting over the reasonableness doctrine, a technical tool inherited from British common law that allows the country&#39;s high court to overrule certain government decisions, though not legislation. But fundamentally, this debate is not about the law itself, which few Israelis could easily explain. It is about whose judgment is trusted to safeguard the country&#39;s democracy.<br><br> Put crudely, the reasonableness doctrine is a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-reason-for-reasonableness-a-doctrine-at-the-heart-of-the-overhaul-explained/">subjective standard</a> that has allowed Israel&#39;s justices to substitute their own considerations for the legislature&#39;s when assessing the merits of certain government actions and civil-service appointments. Given that the members of Israel&#39;s Supreme Court are appointed by a panel composed mostly of other judges and lawyers, a credible case exists for restraining this capacity, which lacks democratic accountability.<br><br> But this week&#39;s reform did not take place in a vacuum. It took place in the context of a power grab by the most hard-right government in Israeli history—one that received only <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://votes25.bechirot.gov.il/">48.4 percent</a> of the vote in the last election. If Israel&#39;s judges no longer get to decide which administrative decisions are “reasonable,” that means that the politicians in power do, even if they, too, lack a mandate. And today, those politicians include <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/maoz-set-to-rejoin-government-resume-role-as-jewish-identity-czar/">homophobes</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel/ben-gvir-convicted-of-inciting-to-racism">convicted</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-728898">criminals</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-elections/analysis-why-is-religious-zionist-politician-dreaming-of-galactic-state-597867">aspiring theocrats</a> , and proud <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/i-made-mistakes-ben-gvir-tells-high-court-hes-refined-since-entering-politics/">nationalist</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-should-wipe-out-palestinian-town-of-huwara-says-senior-minister-smotrich/">chauvinists</a> .<br><br> Polls <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-only-1-in-4-israelis-wants-government-to-press-ahead-with-judicial-overhaul/">consistently</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/AnshelPfeffer/status/1683912208307085321">show</a> that two-thirds of Israel&#39;s citizens oppose the ruling coalition&#39;s unilateral overhaul of the judiciary. Put another way, most Israelis simply do not trust the intentions of their own government. They do not believe that Netanyahu, let alone <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/12/israel-election-bibi-netanyahu-ben-gvir/672572/">the extremist allies he depends upon</a> to maintain his power, will be more reasonable than the unelected Supreme Court. And they do not believe that the coalition will stop with this small salvo against the judiciary when it has already announced its intentions to deconstruct the entire edifice. The Israeli opposition has lost faith in its countrymen to act in the best interest of the entire nation, which is why its leaders now <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/GLZRadio/status/1683697314509082625">openly accuse</a> the government of seeking to destroy democracy.<br><br> This rancor extends well beyond the usual partisan politics, and it runs both ways. Rather than attempting to calm the waters and reestablish civic trust, Netanyahu&#39;s far-right ministers have rubbed their recent victory in the opposition&#39;s face and promised more of the same. “The salad bar is open,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-752065">crowed</a> Ben-Gvir on Saturday night, framing the impending reasonableness reform as merely the appetizer for a much more forbidding buffet. A cannier, more responsible politician would mouth platitudes about how <i>This is a difficult time for Israel, but we are all patriots who want the best for one another and the country.</i> Ben-Gvir does not believe that—and rarely feels compelled to pretend that he does. Instead, he and his allies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/us-envoy-nides-says-claims-that-us-is-funding-protests-in-israel-are-absurd/">have</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/itamarbengvir/status/1683706154986135552">cast</a> the hundreds of thousands of anti-overhaul street protesters as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-03-10/ty-article-magazine/.premium/why-netanyahu-slurs-israels-pro-democracy-protesters-as-anarchists/00000186-c637-d069-a3df-c63ffad90000">“privileged anarchists”</a> and foreign-funded enemies, rather than fellow citizens expressing genuine concern.

In the days ahead, Israel&#39;s Supreme Court may overturn this first strike against its authority, something it has never done before to a quasi-constitutional “basic law” of this kind. The justices may let the legislation stand but interpret it into irrelevance, coming up with new legal ways to get to the same results that the reasonableness doctrine previously provided. Or the Court may punt entirely, deciding that it lacks the power to overrule such a parliamentary prerogative.<br><br> If the Court does undo this decision, it may stall the overhaul, throwing the coalition into chaos and recrimination. Or the reversal may galvanize the far-right&#39;s efforts to pass its entire anti-judicial package, by affirming its belief that small-scale changes will never be enough to change the Court&#39;s jurisprudence. There is a reason, after all, that the right&#39;s original plan included many more components than what has been passed: Removing reasonableness from the judicial toolbox still leaves the rest of the tools, not to mention those who wield them.<br><br> In the long run, the current coalition may use further legislation to cement its power, quash the courts, and marginalize its opposition. Or Netanyahu&#39;s government, which is already <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-25/ty-article/post-judicial-coup-election-polls-give-gantz-30-seats-netanyahus-govt-losing-majority/00000189-8e3a-d4ba-a3e9-ce3fb50a0000">polling poorly</a> , may be crushed by the consequences of its own body blows to Israel&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/stock-market-today-dow-jones-07-25-2023/card/israeli-stocks-shekel-fall-amid-political-and-economic-tumult-oStoKuWQfvDypNBKN7k4">economy</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-says-battle-readiness-weeks-from-being-impacted-as-reservists-decamp-en-masse/">security</a> , and internal cohesion, much as the ill-fated <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/e4a95eac-71bc-4da9-b029-200764179d0c">economic overhaul</a> of British Prime Minister Liz Truss precipitated her exit. The fall of the reasonableness doctrine is the pebble that begins the avalanche, and the thing about avalanches is that they cannot be controlled.<br><br> Still, though the ultimate outcome of this week&#39;s events remains in limbo, one thing is certain: Regardless of whether Israel loses its independent judiciary, it has already lost a core component of any functioning democracy—the sense of collective concern among citizens. And that is something that cannot be fixed by any legislation or court order.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:38:58 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2805540">常见</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/6/e069217">最</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9383197/">严重的</a>症状之一，也是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://batemanhornecenter.org/education/me-cfs/">肌痛性脑脊髓炎</a>（也称为慢性疲劳综合症或 ME/CFS）等类似慢性疾病的特征。但在这些疾病中，疲劳与日常疲倦截然不同，以至于与我交谈过的大多数人都没有预料到疲劳的严重性、多方面性和持久性。<br><br>首先，这种疲劳并不是一个单一的症状；而是一种症状。它<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852700/">有很多面孔</a>。它会让身体变得沉重：丽莎·盖斯勒将其比作“在一个重力极高的星球上穿着铅外骨骼，同时患有严重的关节炎”。它可以使身体加速：许多疲劳的人感到“疲惫不堪”，尽管已经完全精疲力竭，但矛盾的是，他们处于“战斗或逃跑”模式。它可能是认知性的：思想变得迟缓、语无伦次，有时甚至令人痛苦——就像“我的额叶里卡着钢丝绒”，ME 的文学历史学家格温·杜雅尔丁 (Gwynn Dujardin) 告诉我。<br><br>米斯科说，疲劳将最平凡的任务变成了“痛苦的成本效益分析”。如果您洗衣服，您需要休息多长时间才能做饭？如果你喝了水，你能去厕所吗？只有四分之一的长途运输者出现<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm">严重限制其日常活动的</a>症状，但即使是那些患有“中度”病例的人也受到严重限制。斯克里普斯研究中心的项目主管朱莉娅·摩尔·沃格尔仍在工作，但她告诉我，洗头会让她像以前长跑一样疲惫不堪。<br><br>虽然正常的疲劳是暂时的并且可以自行调节——即使在跑完马拉松之后，你也可以自己洗个澡，睡觉后你会感觉更好——但休息通常无法治愈长期新冠肺炎或 ME/CFS 带来的疲劳。 “我醒来时感到很疲惫，”长期感染新冠病毒的莱蒂西亚·苏亚雷斯告诉我。<br><br>由于长期患有新冠肺炎、ME/CFS 和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chronicillnessinclusion.org.uk/2021/04/28/what-are-energy-impairment-and-elci/">其他限制能量的慢性疾病</a>，仅在美国就有数百万人经历着令人衰弱的疲劳。但美国社会倾向于将无所作为等同于不道德，将生产力等同于价值。面对一种根本不允许人们活动的情况——即使是一种可以测量和解释的缺陷——许多医生和亲人默认不相信。当苏亚雷斯告诉别人她的病时，他们通常会说：“哦，是的，我也累了。”当她卧床数天时，人们告诉她，“我需要这样的周末。”苏亚雷斯的问题是非常现实的，尽管研究人员已经开始弄清楚为什么这么多像她这样的人正在遭受痛苦，但他们还不知道如何阻止它。<br><br>疲劳会产生一种残疾的背景嗡嗡声，但它可能会被更严重的撞击事件所打断，这些事件甚至会剥夺长途运输者通常拥有的少量能量。<br><br>达莉亚·奥勒 (Daria Oller) 是一名物理治疗师和运动教练，因此当她在 2020 年 3 月感染新冠病毒时，她很自然地尝试通过锻炼来改善健康。她不明白为什么在短短的跑步之后，她的疲劳、脑雾、胸痛和其他症状就会急剧加剧，以至于她几乎无法动弹或说话。这些事故与她在训练中学到的一切相矛盾。在与 ME/CFS 的物理治疗师交谈后，她才意识到这种现象有一个名字：<em>劳累后不适</em>。<br><br><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Post-exertional_malaise">劳累后不适</a>(PEM) 是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(21)00513-9/fulltext#secsectitle0030">ME/CFS 的典型特征</a>，也是长期新冠肺炎 (COVID-19) 的共同特征。它通常被描述为一种极端形式的疲劳，但更正确的理解是，它是一种生理状态，在这种状态下，<em>所有</em>现有症状都会更加剧烈地燃烧，并且会引发新的症状。除了疲劳之外，患有 PEM 的人还可能会感到剧烈的放射痛、炎症烧灼感或胃肠道和认知问题：“你会感到中毒、流感样、脑震荡，”米斯科说。疲劳通常在劳累后立即出现，而 PEM 可能会在数小时或数天后出现，而且严重程度不成比例。即使是轻微的体力或脑力劳动也可能会让人们疲惫数天、数周、数月。 Visiting a doctor can precipitate a crash, and so can filling out applications for disability benefits—or sensing bright lights and loud sounds, regulating body temperature on hot days, or coping with stress.如果您在疲劳时感觉电池电量耗尽，那么在 PEM 中它们就会完全消失。 It&#39;s the annihilation of possibility: Most people experience the desperation of being unable to move only in nightmares, Dujardin told me. “PEM 就是这样，但更痛苦。”<br><br>医疗专业人员在培训期间通常不会了解 PEM。许多人怀疑它的存在，因为它与健康人所忍受的任何东西都非常不同。玛丽·迪莫克告诉我，只有当她看到患有 ME/CFS 的儿子马修在她眼前崩溃时，她才明白这意味着什么。 “他简直<em>融化了</em>，”迪莫克说。但大多数人从来没有看到过这样的损害，因为 PEM 将那些处于其中的人隐藏起来，不让公众看到。而且由于它通常会在延迟后发生，经历过 PEM 的人可能会在朋友和同事眼中表现良好，而他们随后不会看到他们后来付出的高昂代价。<br><br>这个价格既真实又可衡量。在心肺运动测试（CPET）中，患者使用跑步机或健身自行车，而医生则记录他们的耗氧量、血压和心率。伊萨卡学院的运动生理学家贝特西·凯勒告诉我，如果一天后重新测试，大多数人都可以重复他们的表现，即使他们患有心脏病或因缺乏活动而身体状况不佳。获得 PEM 的人不能。<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4004422/">第二次的结果是如此不同，以至于</a>当凯勒在 2003 年第一次对某人进行 ME/CFS 测试时，“我告诉我的同事，我们的设备没有校准，”她说。但她和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor203170">其他人</a>在数百名 ME/CFS 和长期感染新冠病毒的患者身上发现了同样的模式——“无法用任何心理学解释的客观结果，”布莱根妇女医院的肺科医生 David Systrom 告诉我。 “许多患者被告知这一切都在他们的脑海中，但这确实掩盖了这一点。”尽管如此，许多保险公司拒绝支付第二次检查的费用，而且许多患者无法在不严重危及健康的情况下进行两次（甚至一次）CPET。 “20 年后，我仍然有医生反驳和忽视客观数据，”凯勒说。 （一些长期的新冠肺炎研究<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M22-1492">完全忽略了 PEM</a> ，或者将其与疲劳捆绑在一起。）<br><br>奥勒认为，这种忽视的出现是因为 PEM 颠覆了运动有益的教条——对于大多数其他疾病来说，这句格言是正确的。 “改变你整个职业生涯所做的事情并不容易，即使我告诉某人他们可能会伤害病人，”她说。事实上，许多长途运输者的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/9/5093">情况变得更糟</a>，因为他们在生病的最初几周<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0264331">没有得到足够的休息</a>，或者试图按照医生的指示进行锻炼来缓解症状。<br><br> PEM 患者也经常被误诊。他们被告知，由于久坐不动，他们的身体状况不佳，而他们的不活动是频繁发生车祸的结果，而不是原因。他们被告知，当他们通常拼命想要移动但要么身体无法移动，要么使用约束来避免撞车时，他们会感到沮丧和没有动力。奥勒是一个由 1,500 名患有长期新冠肺炎的耐力运动员组成的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidsupportforenduranceathletes/">支持小组</a>的一员，他们非常习惯在疼痛和疲劳中跑步、游泳和骑自行车。 “为什么我们都要<em>停下来</em>？” she asked.<br><br>一些患有能量限制性疾病的患者认为，他们的疾病名称和症状使他们更容易被抹黑。<em>疲劳</em>会促使人们尽量减少日常疲劳等严重消耗。<em>慢性疲劳综合症</em>将广泛的致残状况分解为容易被忽视的单一症状。这些抱怨是有道理的，但问题比任何名字都更深刻。<br><br>杜雅尔丁（Dujardin）这位英国教授正在（非常缓慢地）撰写一部疲劳文化史，他认为我们对疲劳的概念已经被几个世纪的还原论所削弱。随着医学研究慢慢分裂成解剖学专业，它失去了对人体能量贡献系统的总体认识，或者说它的缺失。能量的概念曾经是（现在仍然是）万物有灵论哲学的核心，虽然也曾经是西方世界的核心，但现在它在文化上与庸医和伪科学联系在一起。杜雅尔丁说：“美国的每台收银机上都备有小瓶‘能量助推器’，”但当美国国立卫生研究院 (NIH) 于 2021 年召开<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/about/events/beyond-symptom-biology-fatigue">疲劳生物学</a>会议时，“专家们不断观察到，疲劳没有标准定义，每个人都认为疲劳没有标准定义。”是从不同的人类能量理念出发进行工作的。”这些术语已经变得如此不具体，毫无帮助，以至于我们的“疲劳”概念可以涵盖多种状态，包括 PEM 和闲置，并且可能受到社会力量的严重影响，尤其是利用他人能量的愿望。<br><br>正如历史学家艾米丽·K·阿贝尔 (Emily K. Abel) 在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/sick-and-tired-an-intimate-history-of-fatigue-emily-k-abel/9781469663340?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《生病与疲倦：疲劳的亲密历史》一书中</em></a>指出的那样，20 世纪之交的许多关于日常疲劳的研究都集中在体力劳动者的疲倦上，并致力于找到让这些工人更加疲劳的方法。富有成效。在此期间，疲劳从雇主必须解决的生理极限转变为个人必须克服的心理失败。 “当今社会对那些不<em>坚持到底</em>的人进行污蔑；<em>坚持下去</em>；<em>表现出勇气</em>，”杜雅尔丁说，而由于颠覆这些规范的罪过，长途运输者“不仅不被相信，而且受到公开的蔑视。”倡导组织 MEAction 的科学和医疗外展主任 Jaime Seltzer 告诉我，疲劳是“彻底反资本主义的”。<br><br>能量限制性疾病对女性的影响也不成比例，长期以来，女性一直被认为是懒惰的人。杜雅尔丹指出，在西方史诗中，像喀耳刻和狄多这样的女性因为用休息的诱惑避开奥德修斯和埃涅阿斯这样的探险英雄而受到严厉的对待。后来，工业化的开始使女性成为居家闲散的象征，而男性却在公共场合劳作。当逃避工作成为一种道德失败时，它也仍然是一种女性的失败。<br><br>这些态度在连续两任美国总统处理新冠疫情的方式中显而易见。唐纳德·特朗普总是表现出男性力量的讽刺，并斥责竞争对手“精力不足”， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/10/trump-strength-coronavirus/616682/">他将自己从冠状病毒中康复描述为一种统治行为</a>。乔·拜登没有那么夸夸其谈，但他仍然明显<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1553451657748512768">向公众保证</a>，他正在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-tests-positive-covid-will-continue-work-white-house-2022-07-21/">努力应对新冠病毒感染</a>，而他的政府则优先考虑让人们<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-health-emergency-management-federal-emergency-management-agency-20f1e637f03f400376e7381df5ccdb51">重返工作岗位的</a>政策。两人都没有提到可能会导致疲劳或需要休息。<br><br>医学也吸收了社会对疲劳的耻辱，甚至在选择那些加入医学行列的人时也是如此。其众所周知的艰苦训练计划将大多数患有能量限制性疾病的人排除在外，同时重视严重耗尽时的运作能力。这一点，再加上对<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/women-pain-gender-bias-doctors/">女性疼痛进行心理分析的</a>倾向，有助于解释为什么如此多的长途运输者<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/health-care-workers-long-covid-are-being-dismissed/620801/">——甚至是那些拥有医学资格的人</a>，如米斯科和奥勒——受到他们寻求护理的专业人士的如此恶劣的对待。她告诉我，当杜雅尔丁第一次因 ME/CFS 症状寻求医疗帮助时，这位十年来一直对她很好的医生突然变得僵硬和多疑，将她所有的详细描述简化为“疲劳”，然后就离开了房间。提供诊断或治疗。<em>永不停息</em>​​的文化压力如此之大，以至于许多人无法接受他们的患者或同龄人可能被迫这样做。<br><br>没有一个大统一的理论可以解释有关长期新冠肺炎和 ME/CFS 的一切，但这些疾病<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2">也不是</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(21)00513-9/fulltext#secsectitle0030">完全的谜团</a>。事实上，有大量证据表明至少有两种途径可以解释为什么患有这些疾病的人的能量如此有限。<br><br>首先，大多数患有能量限制性慢性病的人的自主神经系统都存在问题，该系统控制着心跳、呼吸、睡眠、激素释放和其他我们无意识控制的身体功能。当<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9639503/">这个系统</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/100/8/519/1521818">被破坏</a>时——一种称为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=34">自主神经失调</a>”的情况——肾上腺素等激素可能会在不适当的时刻释放，导致紧张但疲倦的感觉。人们可能会突然感到困倦，就好像他们正在关闭一样。血管可能不会在需要的时候扩张， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2021/11/19/heart-failure-muscles-long-covid-chronic-fatigue/">从而剥夺活跃的肌肉和器官的氧气和燃料</a>；这些器官可能包括大脑，导致认知功能障碍，例如<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/long-covid-brain-fog-symptom-executive-function/671393/">脑雾</a>。<br><br>其次，许多长期患有新冠肺炎和 ME/CFS 的人在产生能量方面存在问题。当病毒侵入人体时，免疫系统会反击，引发炎症状态。感染和炎症都会<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36355108/">损害</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32327453/">线粒体</a>——为细胞提供能量的豆形电池。线粒体功能障碍会产生<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8403932/">称为“活性氧”（ROS）的剧烈化学物质</a>，从而造成更多的细胞损伤。炎症<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ij.hapres.com/htmls/IJ_1341_Detail.html">还会引发新陈代谢转向</a>快速但低效的能量产生方式，耗尽细胞的燃料并充满乳酸。约翰·霍普金斯大学的药理学家和神经科学家宾杜·保罗告诉我，这些变化共同解释了普遍存在的疲劳感，因为“身体难以产生能量”。他们还可以解释患者在细胞充满乳酸和活性氧时所经历的灼热、中毒的感觉。<br><br>这两条途径——自主神经和代谢——也可能是 PEM 的原因。正常情况下，自主神经系统会平稳地调至一种激烈的战斗和逃跑模式，然后调至一种较平静的休息和消化模式。但“在自主神经功能障碍中，旋钮就变成了一个开关，”西奈山的神经科学家和康复专家大卫·普特里诺告诉我。 “你从坐着到站着，你的身体会想：<em>哦，我们要去打猎吗</em>？你停下来，你的身体就会停止运转。”持续的新陈代谢漩涡使这些戏剧性的、不稳定的人字拖变得更加疲惫。受损的线粒体、破坏性的 ROS、低效的新陈代谢和慢性炎症都相互复合，形成恶性循环，如果其变得足够严重，可能会表现为 PEM 崩溃。 “没有人完全确定 PEM 的病因，”Seltzer 告诉我，但“你的新陈代谢发生了巨大的变化，你的神经系统无法恢复平稳”，这是有道理的。普特里诺说，如果人们坚持下去，加深对已经无法满足的身体的代谢需求，那么这个循环就会旋转得更快，“导致渐进性残疾”。<br><br>其他因素也可能在起作用。与健康人相比，长期患有新冠肺炎和 ME/CFS 的人的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00051-2/fulltext">大脑</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032274/">区域</a>的大小、结构或功能存在差异， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2018/12/12/death-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-me-cfs-autopsy-files/">包括</a>传递运动信号和调节意识的丘脑，以及控制运动并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21386#:~:text=Hence%2C%20dysfunctions%20of%20the%20basal,thalamic%E2%80%93frontal%20cortical%20system8.">受到影响的</a>基底神经节。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21386#:~:text=Hence%2C%20dysfunctions%20of%20the%20basal,thalamic%E2%80%93frontal%20cortical%20system8.">在疲劳中</a>。长途运输者还存在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8938726/">血管</a>、<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34087216/">红细胞</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02286-7">凝血</a>方面的问题，所有这些都可能进一步阻碍他们的血液、氧气和营养物质的流动。 “这些年来我测试了很多这样的人，我们一次又一次地看到，当系统开始出现故障时，他们都会以同样的方式出现故障，”凯勒说。这些问题共同解释了为什么长期新冠肺炎和 ME/CFS 会出现如此令人眼花缭乱的不同症状。这种多样性让人难以置信——一种疾病<em>怎么</em><em>会导致这一切</em>？——但如果像新陈代谢这样的基本事物出了差错，这正是你所期望的。<br><br>长途运输者可能不知道其症状的生化细节，但他们非常擅长通过隐喻捕捉这些基础。患有自主神经血流问题的人可能会抱怨感觉“被耗尽”，而这种情况确实正在发生：在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30">POTS</a> （一种自主神经功能障碍的形式）中，当人们站立时，血液会在下半身积聚。 People experiencing metabolic problems often use dead-battery analogies, and indeed their cellular batteries—the mitochondria—are being damaged: “It really feels like something is going wrong at the cellular level,” Oller told me.杜雅尔丁说，细心的医生可以在通常被称为“夸张或夸张”的描述中找到有关患者疾病基础的重要线索。<br><br>一些新冠肺炎长途运输者确实康复了。 But several studies have found that, so far, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4505315">most don&#39;t</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29513-z">fully return</a> to their previous baseline, and many who become severely ill stay that way.这群长期患病的人现在陷入了长期困扰那些患有 ME/CFS 等疾病的人们同样的忽视之中。对此类疾病的研究资金<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32568148/">严重不足</a>，因此不存在治愈方法。在美国，很少有医生<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/mecfs-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-doctors-long-covid/671518/">知道如何治疗这些疾病</a>，而且许多医生都已接近退休，因此患者很难找到治疗方法。长期新冠肺炎诊所虽然存在，但质量参差不齐：有些诊所对其他能量限制疾病一无所知，但仍然开出可能有害且<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/25/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-cdc/">官方不鼓励的治疗方法</a>，例如运动。更了解这些疾病的临床医生知道谨慎至关重要。当 Putrino 与长途运输者一起修复他们的自主神经系统时，他总是尽可能温和地开始，以避免触发 PEM。他说，这样的工作“并不容易，也不是很快”，而且通常意味着稳定人们的情绪，而不是治愈他们。<br><br>稳定可以改变生活，特别是当它涉及患者可以在家中保持的变化时。辅酶 Q10 等<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432282/">非处方补充剂</a>可以<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25386668/">减轻疲劳</a>，线粒体利用辅酶 Q10 产生能量，但<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20010505/">在 ME/CFS 患者中会耗尽</a>。<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Low_dose_naltrexone">低剂量纳曲酮</a>等抗炎药物可能有一些希望。睡眠卫生可能无法治愈疲劳，但肯定可以减轻疲劳。饮食习惯的改变可能会有所帮助，但正确的改变可能会违反直觉：高纤维食物需要更多的能量来消化，一些长途运输者在吃了<em>看似</em>健康的饭菜后会出现 PEM 发作。这个投资组合中最重要的部分是“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Pacing#The_principles_of_pacing">节奏</a>”——一种小心地将你的活动水平保持在导致严重崩溃的阈值以下的策略。<br><br>节奏比听起来更具挑战性。练习者不能依赖固定的常规；相反，他们必须学会实时测量自己波动的能量水平，同时敏锐地意识到 PEM 触发因素。一些人转向心率监测器等可穿戴技术，超过 30,000 人正在测试一款<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.makevisible.com/blog/why-we-are-building-visible">名为 Visible 的患者设计应用程序</a>，以帮助发现他们的疾病模式。这些数据很有用，但休息和 PEM 之间的差异可能只是每分钟多 10 或 20 次心跳——长途运输者必须把自己的生命挤进一个狭窄的缝隙。这样做可能会令人沮丧，因为节奏并不是一种恢复策略；而是一种恢复策略。这主要是为了防止情况变得更糟，这使得它的价值更难被欣赏。它对身体的好处是以精神为代价的：散步、锻炼、社交，“我以前为心理健康所做的所有事情都是巨大的能量消耗，”沃格尔告诉我。如果没有经济稳定或社会支持，许多长途运输者就必须工作、养育孩子并照顾自己，即使他们知道自己以后会受苦。 “不过度是不可能的，因为生活就是生活，”沃格尔说。<br><br> “我们的社会不适合节奏，”奥勒补充道。长途运输者必须顶住巨大的文化压力，通过尽最大努力证明自己的价值。他们必须容忍因试图避免事故而受到的惩罚，以及如果失败则得不到信任。 “人们能说的最具侮辱性的话之一就是‘对抗你的疾病’，”米斯科说。这对她来说会容易得多。 “需要很大的自制力和力量才能少做、少做、把你的生活缩小到一两件小事，你试图从中获取快乐才能生存。”对于她和其他许多人来说，休息既是一种医疗必需品，也是一种激进的反抗行为——这种行为本身就令人筋疲力尽。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

</i>上诉。最终，发行权被卖给了天使工作室，这是一家位于犹他州的公司，制作了基督教历史剧<i>《选民》</i> 。自从<i>《自由之声》</i>开始在影院上映以来，一些观众<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/07/20/false-claim-amc-shut-off-ac-for-sound-of-freedom-fact-check/70431071007/">声称存在旨在阻止他们观看这部电影的破坏事件</a>。本周， <i>《自由之声》的</i>收入突破了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/23/sound-of-freedom-qanon-movie-conspiracy-theories">1 亿美元</a>。上周，前总统唐纳德·特朗普在新泽西州的高尔夫俱乐部举行了一场放映活动，他借用帕丽斯·希尔顿的话说，这部电影是“世界上最热门的电影”。周二晚上，众议院议长凯文·麦卡锡为国会议员放映了这部电影。<br><br>这部电影的批评者认为，这部电影夸大了儿童剥削的普遍性，从而有助于推进<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">匿名者Q的阴谋论</a>，即撒旦统治精英猥亵儿童并以他们的鲜血为食。但电影的粉丝说，<i>这是民主党精英不想让你看的电影！</i><br><br> <i>《自由之声》</i>两者都不是。还好——不算太好，但也不算太糟糕。它没有提及“深层政府”的吸血或国会性阴谋。这是一部简单但乏味的动作片，讲述了一个男人追求正义的故事——角色发展为零，有太多的人哭泣或抽雪茄的特写镜头。<br><br>尽管这部电影没有描绘任何特别生动的内容，但虐待儿童的主题仍然很难在大银幕上戏剧化地观看。这令人心烦意乱。但后来与其他观众谈论这件事时也是如此，他们中的许多人似乎相信他们的一些同胞纵容贩卖儿童。换句话说， <i>《自由之声》</i>只是一场看似无休无止的文化战争的最新导火索，这场文化战争鼓励美国人相信彼此最坏的一面。<br><br>在电影中，巴拉德由吉姆·卡维泽 (Jim Caviezel) 饰演，他也在 2004 年的<i>《耶稣受难记</i><i>》</i>中饰演耶稣，他本人也涉足 Q 的黑暗奇思妙想。 2021 年，他在俄克拉荷马州的一次右翼会议上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/07/sound-of-freedom-qanon-theories-jim-caviezel/">发表讲话</a>，他警告与会者注意“儿童的肾上腺素红”，这是一个荒谬的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-qanon-became-obsessed-with-adrenochrome-an-imaginary-drug-hollywood-is-harvesting-from-kids">理论</a>，称全球精英正在使用从被绑架的儿童身上获取的化学物质来让他们看起来精神抖擞。电影中的某一时刻，当被问到为什么他如此坚定地要拯救孩子们时，卡维泽的角色停了下来，他的眼睛里充满了泪水。 “上帝的孩子是不卖的，”他说。我的剧院爆发出掌声和“阿门！”的呼喊声。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">摘自2020年6月号：Q的预言</a><br><br>这部电影团结了宗教保守派和特朗普的支持者，以及一小部分长期偏执的人——或者至少在我的放映中似乎是这样。 （我选择这个特定的剧院是因为，当我在网上查看时，很多人都买了票——可能是因为麦克莱恩比华盛顿特区的许多其他地方拥有更多的右倾选民。）<br><br>凯特·考克斯 (Kate Cox) 是一位来自麦克莱恩 (McLean) 的退休人员，戴着小花朵耳环，她在电影开始前告诉我，她是“反堕胎天主教徒”，担心边境问题。 “这正是这件事的意义所在，”她说。 “他们正在把这些人卖为性奴隶。”考克斯和她的女朋友们还担心从墨西哥运来的芬太尼：<i>建一堵墙有多难？</i><br><br> “还有无家可归的人！”考克斯的朋友佩吉拒绝透露自己的姓氏，她补充道。 “城市正在分崩离析。”考克斯点点头。 “不管你对特朗普有什么看法，99%都是真的，”她说，“但这在特朗普统治下并没有发生。”<br><br>与拥有巨额营销预算和企业合作伙伴关系的<i>芭比娃娃</i>不同，口碑似乎是<i>自由之声的</i>主要上座驱动力：周日与我交谈的大多数人都是在亲人的推荐下购买了门票。<br><br> “我的一个朋友告诉我看这部电影，”居住在华盛顿的瑞士人妮可·古铁雷斯 (Nicole Gutierrez) 告诉我。 “这是一个比我们想象的更大的业务。好莱坞、政客——他们都参与其中。”她拿出手机给我看她朋友几分钟前发的一条短信。 “也许你知道这意味着什么。”她的朋友发送了字母<i>C</i> ，然后是眼睛表情符号，最后是字母<i>A</i> 。 “我认为他指的是中央情报局，”我说。古铁雷斯扬起眉毛。 “每个人都参与其中，”她说。 “当然是白宫。”<br><br>在片尾字幕后的奖励片段中，卡维泽用小声鼓励观众扫描二维码，为买不起票的人买票。 “我们可以让<i>《自由之声》</i>成为 21 世纪奴隶制的<i>汤姆叔叔的小屋</i>，”他说，并将这部电影比作激发 19 世纪废奴运动的小说。之后，当灯光亮起时，我这一排一位自称切斯卡的女士站起来，宣布她来这里是为了谈论她失踪一年半的 23 岁女儿。 “我期待奇迹的出现，”她说。 “她很快就会回来。”切斯卡警告我们末日即将来临，并要求我们为她和彼此祈祷。有几个人再次说：“阿门”，至少有一个女人拥抱了她。<br><br>当我离开剧院时，我走近另一群朋友，听听他们的想法。 They all declined to share their last names, but were happy to tell me how powerful they&#39;d found the movie. “男人想要保护别人，”一位名叫乔治的黑发中年男子说道，“所以有人会对孩子做出这样的事情，这真是令人尴尬。”他提出了杰森·阿尔丁的新歌《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-streams-up-controversy-1235543896/">在小镇尝试</a>》，乡村艺术家在歌曲中承诺为治安维持正义。 “我喜欢那首没人愿意谈论的歌曲，”乔治说。真正的男人会殴打虐待儿童的人。<br><br> “你意识到你正在和该地区少数几个保守派人士交谈吗？”乔治的大胡子朋友史蒂文眨了眨眼睛问我。 “你知道让我惊讶的是，”他继续说道，“这就是左派讨厌这部电影的原因。我不明白。”他看着我，好像在等待答案。<br><br>如果左翼人士对这部电影感到排斥，那么右翼人士也出于同样的原因觉得有必要看这部电影。 Our political leaders, our social circles, and our chosen media have signaled in our echo chambers exactly how we should feel about it—and so much else, besides. <a data-event-element="inline link"

class="smallcaps">ooking for a</span> good vacation this year? You might choose from a number of models. For example, Instagram Adventure, in which you pick an exotic destination, pack as much as you can into every day, take a million pictures, and document everything on social media to advertise that you are as energetic in leisure as you are at work. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Couch Potato, which means that you fritter away the entire two weeks doing very little. Other popular options include Two Endless Weeks in My Childhood Bedroom (for 20-somethings) and A Whole Month&#39;s Pay Shot at Disney Because the Kids Whined All Year (for 30-somethings).<br><br> One great vacation model, which harks back to the ancients, is frequently overlooked. The word for “leisure” in Greek is σχολή, or <i>skhole</i> . In Latin, the word is <i>schola</i> —from which we get “school.” In other words, the name for the place where we teach and learn derives from the word for “leisure.” One way to interpret this is that education is a recreational activity (a concept that may strike my hardworking students as counterintuitive). But a better explanation comes from the 20th-century philosopher Josef Pieper, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Leisure.html?id=VKbcnmvM7N8C&amp;source=kp_book_description">believed</a> that leisure is the circumstance in which we can learn the most, if we understand and use it properly.<br><br> If the conventional vacation models are leaving you cold, Pieper&#39;s insight could provide the holiday you&#39;ve been looking for. This year, consider using your time off as an opportunity to learn something wonderful.<br><br> P <span class="smallcaps">eople pursue</span> different objectives in their vacations, but no one I have ever met was seeking <i>lower</i> levels of positive emotion. The point is to be happier than usual, which is why a bad vacation is so frustrating—it feels like a missed opportunity to reset and make some emotional progress.<br><br> To get the most contentment from your vacation, it is worthwhile to start with an understanding of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00781/full#:~:text=Robert%20Plutchik%20proposed%20eight%20primary,them%20in%20a%20color%20wheel.">basic</a> human emotions. The negative side includes anger, sadness, fear, and disgust, which alert us to threats and stimulate behaviors such as fight or flight to keep us safe. These are obviously not the emotions you are hoping to experience on vacation—though all bets are off if a long car ride with the kids is involved.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/07/pre-vacation-time-off-work-pressure/670939/">Read: Why must we work so hard before vacation?</a><br><br> An abundance of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122271/">basic positive emotions</a> such as joy, surprise, and anticipation are what you seek. But you shouldn&#39;t neglect another positive emotion of special importance: interest—the feeling of curiosity or fascination that captures your attention.<br><br> The experience of interest is favored by evolution: It comes from learning new things, which rewarded our ancestors with more food and a greater chance at survival and reproduction. The same tendency for your Pleistocene hominin forebear to feel satisfaction after devising a novel way to catch a small animal persists in us today when we first master riding a bike or succeed in making a presentable soufflé.<br><br> The well-being effect from learning is not as straightforward as it is for other activities, such as eating a doughnut. In fact, it involves a bit of sacrifice. As scholars <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-009-9166-1">found</a> in 2011, investing in an activity to raise competency can lower your moment-to-moment happiness but can boost well-being measured over a longer time frame of hours and days. This makes perfect sense, of course: You rack your brain <i>learning</i> calculus but then bask in <i>knowing</i> it. In that respect, learning is like exercise: sometimes painful in the moment but rewarding overall.<br><br> A key to maximizing satisfaction through learning is intrinsic motivation, or what the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (who famously wrote about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cgu.edu/people/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/">“flow states”</a> ) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9094-9_7">called</a> “autotelic learning”: learning for its own sake. Neuroscientists in 2014 used fMRI technology to show that this type of learning has to do with the brain&#39;s response to curiosity. They <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(14)00804-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627314008046%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">demonstrated</a> high levels of activity in the midbrain and a structure known as the nucleus accumbens, which indicated an enhanced release of dopamine, when study participants were highly curious about a subject. In other words, satisfying your curiosity through learning about whatever you&#39;re most interested in will give you a neurochemical payoff.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C. Brooks?

You might be tempted to extrapolate from this evidence to predict, for example, that if everybody went to college, we would have a happier society. Not so fast: One 2017 study <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-017-9504-0">suggests</a> that whether higher education drives happiness up or down depends on, among other things, where you live. In nations without high levels of education, many of which are considered developing countries, university education is associated with higher happiness. In countries with labor markets saturated with educated individuals, which is characteristic of greater economic development, the effect is reversed—university attendance is associated with lower happiness. One possible explanation is that for the former group, university training offers a path out of poverty, but for the latter group much of this effect has long since been depleted. Alternatively, something about the rich-world college experience may contribute to lower well-being. Suffice to say that the sort of leisure learning the Greeks had in mind is not identical with the modern American college experience.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">aken together</span> , the research points to a clear strategy to build a great vacation: Identify something you are very interested in for its own sake and focus on it intensively. And because the task or skill should be challenging enough to increase competence, the satisfaction goal should be understood in hours and days, not in the moment to moment of learning.<br><br> You can choose a range of ways to achieve this outcome, whether cheap and casual or expensive and formal. At one end of the scale, you can simply program your own reading curriculum. Over two weeks, you might set about carefully reading four books on a particular topic. Or you might decide to read the entire Bible or Quran. You might also mix your media: reading a biography of JS Bach, for instance, while listening to 50 of his cantatas.<br><br> At a more formal level, you might dedicate your vacation to taking a class. Perhaps you want to learn how to cook Punjabi cuisine, or follow one of the many “massive open online classes” (MOOCs, for short) that are available for free, such as—random example—one about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.edx.org/course/managing-happiness">exploring the science of happiness</a> . For a more intensive (and expensive) option, you might hire a teacher to give you a head start on playing the guitar or speaking Mandarin, and do that for several hours every day. Or hire a nutrition-and-fitness coach. You will be amazed at how much progress you can make in two weeks.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/04/covid-workcation-remote-work-life-balance/629605/">Read: &#39;Workcations&#39; aren&#39;t an escape. They&#39;re practice.</a><br><br> At the most rigorous level, you might go all in and spend your vacation on a guided silent retreat in one spiritual tradition or another. Or perhaps you could make a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/09/happiness-walking-pilgrimage/620075/">pilgrimage</a> , walking in contemplation without devices or interruptions, and immersing yourself during rest periods in a wisdom literature that complements the experience.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">na famous passage</span> of <i>The Republic</i> , Plato <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D7&amp;force=y">advises</a> on how to educate children in a way that will bring out their best: “Do not … keep children to their studies by compulsion but by play. That will … better enable you to discern the natural capacities of each.” In other words, kids will learn better if you allow them to enjoy recreation in a constructive way, rather than forcing them to study, which is more likely to stimulate rebellion.<br><br> A similar principle lies behind the best model of vacation. Feeling compelled to relax and have fun is a common and counterproductive mistake. Telling yourself “I <i>will</i> be refreshed and not think about work!” is bound to lead in the wrong direction. Instead, employ a Platonic strategy and turn your leisure into learning. You might just have your best holiday ever.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/vacation-learning-leisure-happiness/674743/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/vacation-learning-leisure-happiness/674743/</item></channel></rss>
