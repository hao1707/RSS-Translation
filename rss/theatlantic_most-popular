href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-x-rebrand-juvenile-internet-style/674875/">新名字</a>还没有被人们所接受——理论上来说，滚动浏览我的提要可能会达到某种催眠效果，为睡眠创造一个机会。就在那时我看到了模糊的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sciencecast.org/casts/suc384jly50n">视频</a>。其中，一块小而畸形的材料碎片，像铅笔折断的铅尖一样，神秘地悬浮在厚厚的抛光金属晶片上方。<br><br>我直接滚动过去。尽管关注了相当多的“纯粹的科学事物”聚合器，但在凌晨时分，我并不总是对启发感到兴奋。但几分钟后，我又看到了这个视频，然后是第三次。我注意到这不是对磁力的说教解释。这是新闻：漂浮的岩石是 LK-99，一种由韩国科学家团队合成的物质，他们认为它是一种室温环境压力超导体。<br><br>我想告诉大家，那天晚上<em>“室温常压超导体”</em>这个词对我来说很有意义，但没有。我对这句话感到困惑，就像猿猴审视着一块巨石。我寻找上下文线索。我数了数感叹号。经过几分钟的内心抵制后，我做了一些尽职调查，我的意思是轻松而睡眼惺忪地谷歌搜索。最终，通过一些努力，我了解到 LK-99 可能是材料科学家的圣杯发现。<br><br>但不仅仅是材料科学家！这与 2020 年在金星大气层中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/09/venus-life-phosphine-microbes/616342/">观测</a>到的磷化氢不同。如果这一发现成立（可惜<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/potential-signs-life-venus-are-fading-astronomers-downgrade-their-original-claims">事实并非如此</a>），它将强烈表明该行星上存在生命，这是一项划时代的发现，但不会改变我们的世界。室温超导体的存在不仅仅是一个关于自然的新事实。相反，根据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://theconversation.com/room-temperature-superconductors-could-revolutionize-electronics-an-electrical-engineer-explains-the-materials-potential-201849">一些</a>观察家的说法，这意味着我们可以获得一种神奇的、万能的物质，它可以将我们带入一个新技术时代，电力在我们的世界中<a

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/lk99-superconductors-floating-rocks/674939/">复制韩国研究结果的</a>全球竞赛已经开始，互联网上的许多人都兴奋地观看着。中国首先到达那里的幽灵增添了一层地缘政治阴谋。 （我喜欢想象美国的材料科学家挤在一起，准备迎接他们的人造卫星时刻。） 与此同时， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/23820077/lk-99-superconductor-experts">据报道</a>韩国科学家之间也存在<a data-event-element="inline link"

Twitch 观众惊叹于游戏玩家最新的击杀镜头一样。如果不出意外的话，这是一种打发时间的好方法，直到一个闪闪发光的科技乌托邦在我们周围实现。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/lk99-superconductors-floating-rocks/674939/">阅读：浮石的重要一周</a><br><br>明确地说，我所描述的是我所经历过的 LK-99 周围的氛围。最接近的类似可能是去年 11 月 ChatGPT 发布时的狂热。也许您还记得：大流行晚期的不适正在逐渐消退；人们已经准备好接受闪亮的新事物；然后，突然间，这些东西以机器人的形式出现，它们可以聊天、编码，甚至可能破坏你的婚姻。社交媒体上充斥着他们最聪明、最狡猾的攻击行为的屏幕截图<em>。</em><br><br>在 ChatGPT 发布后的几个月里，一些人开始相信正在发生“<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/foom">爆炸</a>”。在人工智能文献中，当人工智能的级联自我改进加速其自身发展，直至其变得强大到超出人类理解范围时，就会出现繁荣。 （这个词的意思是让人想起爆炸性喷发的声音。）这种特殊的、所谓的爆炸的巧妙之处在于：它是实时体验的，至少对于那些足够在线的人来说是这样。我们被<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://a16z.com/2023/06/06/ai-will-save-the-world/">告知，</a>技术即将让我们摆脱痛苦和匮乏，你可以在 Twitter 上看到这一切。在特朗普担任总统期间，创造了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/doomscrolling-the-new-high-tech-way-to-slide-into-despair-11607640701"><em>“doomscrolling”</em></a>这个词来描述通过智能手机发布坏消息的习惯。这是不同的；它具有正价。称之为 fooscrolling。<br><br>并非所有新兴技术都会导致 fooscrolling。当它的非凡力量可以通过一些立即可识别的视觉形式（例如双音聊天屏幕截图或漂浮的岩石）来展示时，这种行为就更有可能发生。更重要的是，要获得 Foomscrolling 的资格，新兴技术必须是能够合理提升物种水平的技术。 （阿波罗任务会导致无休止的滚动；想象一下，<em>地出</em>照片有 100 万次转发，<span class="smallcaps">标题是我们回来了</span>。）GLP-1 受体激活药物，比如 Ozempic 中的药物，提供了一个有启发性的反例。尽管构成了人们期待已久的奇迹——一种<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2023/08/08/novo-nordisk-wegovy-cardiovascular-risk/">有效</a>的减肥药——但它们只能解决某些问题<em>。</em>没有人发帖称这些药物最终将解决气候变化问题； Ozempic 不会提示任何人进行 fooscroll。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/ozempic-pills-obesity-drugs-semaglutide/674541/">阅读：再见，臭氧</a><br><br>就人工智能而言，快速滚动很快就变成了一种自嘲的东西：人工智能影响者的家庭手工业。他们支付了蓝色支票和个人简历，小心翼翼地洗白了他们之前对加密货币的热情。最初，它们很有用。该领域发展迅速，有一些行业新闻聚合器是件好事，尽管有些人容易轻信。但他们很快就声称本周令人心碎的突破清单比上周更广泛，从而压倒了讨论。这一切开始显得有点悲伤，就像 LinkedIn 一样。<br><br>也许这只是 fooscrolling 循环。最近几天，LK-99 粉丝群体一直处于不利地位。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-08-08/superconductor-lk-99-sample-may-be-available-in-weeks">通货紧缩现实主义</a>的光环已经开始为这个故事增添色彩。一些评论家声称 LK-99 只是一种<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/alexkaplan0/status/1688734992682086400">铁磁体</a>，科学家们已经得到消息，即使这种物质确实是室温超导体，通往<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-world-if">“社会将如何看待”模因</a>中描绘的未来之路也将是漫长的。一。复制声明不再是我的“为你”提要的首要内容。细微差别和清醒似乎赢得了胜利。<br><br>超导滚动的顶峰可能已经过去了。但推动它的文化欲望——对一种新工具的渴望，能够帮助我们摆脱人性的弱点，走上某种平稳的指数轨迹，通向闪闪发光和不朽的未来——看起来相当有弹性。这种集体渴望可能从奥杜瓦伊以来就以这样或那样的形式伴随着我们。互联网只是将其放大为一种探照灯。我想象它的光束很快就会找到其他东西来锁定，世界上的失眠症患者可以在夜深人静的时候用谷歌搜索一些新的东西，希望这一次，繁荣将是真实的。<br><br></div>

Russia Will Exploit It.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>对尼日尔剧变最令人兴奋的解释是全球性的，而且可能是错误的。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/X4FarXnxmgCdhUefxT-wrr23MFU=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/niger_coup/original.jpg" alt="尼日尔的抗议者" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>法新社/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>上个月底，尼日尔武装部队推翻了政府，逮捕了当选总统，并为自己夺取了权力。不久之后，一小群支持首都尼亚美政变的尼日尔人聚集在一起，表达对军政府的支持，其中一些人挥舞着俄罗斯国旗。他们普遍谴责西方，特别是前殖民国家法国。 “普京万岁！” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/07/30/niger-pro-russian-protesters-military-coup-mohamed-bazoum/">他们高呼</a>。 “打倒法国！”<br><br>这场政变在西方各国首都引起了相当大的恐慌，这是有充分理由的。自 2020 年以来， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/niger-coup-could-threaten-entire-sahel">萨赫勒地区不断发生政变</a>，这是一条横跨非洲、紧邻撒哈拉沙漠、具有重要战略意义的炎热半干旱地带。 2020年，马里政府垮台。 2021年，苏丹、乍得和几内亚也发生了同样的事情。去年，布基纳法索发生政变。尼日尔被视为萨赫勒地区抵御混乱和不稳定的最后堡垒，也是最后一个政权。美国在尼日尔设有无人机基地，法国也在那里驻军，这是抵御西非圣战主义高涨的重要防线。现在，所有这一切都面临着风险。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/niger-europe-migrants-jihad-africa/553019/">阅读：西非危险的移民镇压</a><br><br>很少有美国人习惯于过多思考尼日尔（“你指的是尼日利亚吗？”），但今年夏天的事件似乎提供了一个鲜明的结论：亲俄罗斯的士兵推翻了亲西方的政府。民主被军事独裁连根拔起。对于任何经历过冷战的人来说，这个故事都很熟悉。尼日尔出口铀——核反应堆的重要资源——这一事实使得尼日尔的斗争更容易被理解为一场地缘政治棋局。尼日尔是一颗棋子，当地缘政治国王之间拉动棋子时，就会发生政变。因此，这场政变很快就成为一个关于美国、俄罗斯和法国的故事，而不是关于尼日尔的故事。<br><br>在解释国际新闻中的重大事件时，尤其是那些发生在陌生地点的事件时，我们都倾向于表现出地缘政治偏见，这种心态通过国际大战略的棱镜过滤每一个事件，并让每一个故事都与<em>我们</em>有关。简单化、熟悉的叙述击败了细致入微的解释，这些解释涉及很少非专业人士听说过的政治人物，他们以晦涩的缩写词和难以发音的名字而闻名。<br><br>尼日尔的军事政变已经成为耸人听闻的头条新闻和与宏大地缘政治比喻相关的政治声明的素材。乌克兰总统的一名高级顾问<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/1/russia-responsible-for-niger-coup-says-top-ukrainian-official">在没有证据的情况下坚称俄罗斯煽动了政变</a>。<em>布隆伯格</em>将这次政变报道为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-08-03/niger-coup-the-long-arm-of-russia-and-the-politics-of-uranium?leadSource=uverify%20wall">克里姆林宫的长臂</a>”的最新证据。 <em>《新闻周刊》</em>宣称，尼日尔的政变意味着“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/countdown-next-great-war-has-begun-africa-1817095">非洲下一场大战已经开始倒计时</a>”。<br><br>俄罗斯可能会因为尼日尔政变而扩大影响力（有报道称<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/niger-coup-wagner-group-junta-leaders-president-africa-regional-bloc-rcna98306">军政府正在向瓦格纳集团雇佣兵寻求帮助</a>）。但迄今为止，关于俄罗斯参与程度的猜测大多基于极其薄弱的证据——在一个面积是法国两倍的国家，在一个城市的一次抗议中，有数百人举行抗议活动，其中少数人举着俄罗斯国旗。拥有超过 2500 万人口。即使在政变之前，尼日尔的首都也是反对派的据点，因此，居住在那里的一些人举行示威以支持推翻他们厌恶的总统的士兵也就不足为奇了。<br><br>政变背后的推动力很可能是复杂、微妙的，与其说是克里姆林宫的因素，不如说是国内动态的因素。更平庸的当地事业的可能性并不能消除许多尼日尔人对法国的真正愤怒，也不能消除一些人不得不转向俄罗斯作为明显反西方的替代国际赞助商的误导性冲动。但当地媒体报道的对政变发生原因的简单解释似乎是正确的。<br><br>现任总统穆罕默德·巴祖姆一直<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-66324875">计划解雇</a>指挥精锐总统卫队的阿卜杜拉哈曼·奇亚尼将军。既然政变已经发生，奇亚尼将军不会被解雇。相反，他宣布自己是新军政府的领导人，该军政府自称为国家保卫祖国委员会。<br><br>奥卡姆剃刀的解释可能是正确的：一位即将被解雇的将军决定解雇总统。许多政变都有这样简单的起源故事，由军队内部的派系斗争以及雄心勃勃、自私自利的人引发，他们乐意将军营换成宫殿。<br><br>无论他赌博的原因是什么，奇亚尼很可能没有预料到他自掌权以来所面临的强烈反对。大多数国际参与者，包括俄罗斯，都谴责了这次政变（尽管克里姆林宫关于尊重宪法的声明最好持保留态度）。也许对奇亚尼计划最令人惊讶的威胁来自于一个主要的区域权力掮客——西非国家经济共同体。以尼日利亚为最强大成员的西非15个国家联盟对政变采取了强硬立场，甚至<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/niger-abuja-niamey-ecowas-coup-bazoum-explainer-33a6c0fa7396a90f7b78b0310ae20b32">威胁进行军事干预</a>。一些人因此将西非经共体描绘成<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/08/03/peoples-movements-oppose-west-backed-military-intervention-by-ecowas-in-niger/">西方的傀儡</a>，是欧美矛头的锋利末端。<br><br>再一次，一个更简单（且地缘政治方面不那么令人兴奋）的解释可能是正确的。西非国家经济共同体可能不会对这次政变采取强硬立场，因为它是一个木偶，或者因为它在意识形态上厌恶弗拉基米尔·普京；其成员国政府可能只是关心自身的自我保护。<br><br> “地区总统对军事干预感兴趣的一个原因是，他们越来越害怕自己被除掉，”伯明翰大学非洲政治专家尼克·奇斯曼教授说。 “在此之前，该地区发生了其他几起政变，他们意识到，如果他们不划清界限，他们可能就是下一个政变的受害者。”<br><br>尼日尔的政变可能并非源于大国竞争，而是源于政治和其他近在眼前的动态，但它仍然可能产生严重的国际影响。随着<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/violent-extremism-sahel">圣战主义抬头</a>，萨赫勒地区的安全局势正在恶化。事实证明，过去三年上台的军政府无力与之抗衡。此外，尽管许多新的军事政权——特别是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/3/malian-minister-says-russia-will-ship-food-and-fuel-to-mali-in-coming-weeks">马里</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/burkina-faso-interim-leader-hails-russia-strategic-ally-2023-05-05/">布基纳法索</a>——已经与俄罗斯结盟，但俄罗斯政府和瓦格纳集团并没有足够的闲钱，也没有大量训练有素的军队等待部署到非洲，他们因乌克兰的惨败而陷入困境。在接下来的几个月里，萨赫勒地区的政变后政权可能会意识到，他们已经将财力雄厚且长期致力于提供外援的西方伙伴换成了一个衰弱的克里姆林宫，而克里姆林宫将不可避免地承诺过多而兑现不足。钱最终会用完。<br><br>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2020/05/niger-other-eu">萨赫勒边界</a>”，关闭了经尼日尔通往地中海的移民通道。政变可能会重新开放这条路线，重振以前繁荣的阿加德兹交通枢纽。美国也关心阿加德兹：美国无人机基地尼日尔 201 空军基地就位于该镇外。<br><br>如果尼日尔军政府设法继续掌权，它几乎肯定会与俄罗斯结盟。临时政权已经宣布<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/03/niger-coup-junta-joe-biden-mohamed-bazoum">取消与法国的多项军事协议</a>。但如果它向克里姆林宫示好，它就会猛然醒悟。正如马里和布基纳法索所发现的那样，俄罗斯有足够的财富来支付小规模雇佣军的费用，并满足贪婪士兵的腰包，但它还远远不够富有，无法为世界上最贫穷的国家之一的更广泛的人口提供食物。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=XL&amp;most_recent_value_desc=false">人均GDP</a>低于600美元的国家。<br><br>正如撒哈拉以南非洲地区经常发生的情况一样，受害者将是那些最无法忍受的人。随着士兵变身政客致富，尼日尔更广泛的民众将遭受苦难。这个故事与地缘政治无关，而是关于数百万弱势群体的普通痛苦，其墨水量将大大减少。<br><br></div>

3:52。</em></small><br><br>乡村音乐是一种具有百年历史的怀旧、传统和乡音音乐流派，其风格从未如此流行。上周，<em>公告牌</em>百强单曲榜历史上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-number-one-hot-100-country-hits-top-three-1235382220/">首次</a>出现美国最受欢迎的三首乡村歌曲。对于这一里程碑的一个解释是，该流派的艺术家和观众最终<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/country-music-consumption-up-2023-morgan-wallen/">倾向于</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/music/news/cmts-morgan-wallen-country-streaming-march-1235573629/">流媒体</a>：今年，乡村音乐的听众人数增长了 20%，增幅仅次于拉丁音乐和韩国流行音乐。<br><br>但这是一场值得庆祝的奇怪胜利，不仅因为上周排名第一的歌曲杰森·阿尔丁（Jason Aldean）的《在小镇尝试》（Try That in a Small Town）已被证明是一个政治热点。现在突破的曲目每首听起来都不像<em>乡村</em>音乐。这种流派总是传达出一定程度的失败者的反抗，但最近，音乐和围绕它的对话有一种明显的怨恨色彩。<br><br>在《在小镇尝试一下》中，46 岁的佐治亚州流行音乐制作人阿尔丁向所谓的乡村价值观（荣誉、邻里关系、拥有枪支）致敬，警告听众所谓的城市病态（抢劫、向警察吐口水、焚烧旗帜） ）不要乘坐某些人所说的“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/06/a-note-about-trumpism-from-the-real-america/623689/">真正的美国</a>”。 “在这里，我们照顾自己的事情，”他夸口道。但音乐很难让人想起宁静的牧场或布满锯末的酒吧。当我听到这首歌中低沉的吉他声、低沉的小和弦以及从 Foo Fighters 的《Everlong》中摘录的即兴重复段时，我感觉自己回到了我的郊区男性青春期，大约是公元 2000 年——那时我穿着一件超大的黑色连帽衫，聆听带有灵魂补丁的男人的呻吟。 Aldean 的歌曲名义上是乡村歌曲，但其声音却是后垃圾摇滚另类摇滚。<br><br> 90 年代初，Nirvana 及其同侪为一种新的主​​流男子气概开辟了空间：容易受到失败和疏远感的影响，但又带有一种硬朗、嘈杂的边缘，没有人会认为这是<em>娘娘腔</em>。很快，一群<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/linkin-park-chester-bennington/561713/">旋律优美的</a>乐队出现了，比如 Bush、Creed 和 Nickelback，他们剪掉了朋克风格中的垃圾摇滚，为漫无目的的焦虑创造了一个广泛吸引人的模板。现在，阿尔丁用踏板钢和右翼谈话要点更新了该模板。<br><br>你可能听说过<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/jason-aldean-donald-trump/674842/">这首歌是有争议的</a>。阿尔丁设置了一个完美的话语陷阱，利用了美国当前在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/historians-clash-1619-project/604093/">其自身历史的两种理论</a>之间的分裂，以及强烈反对与反对之间循环的可预测性和盈利能力。尽管这首歌没有提及种族，但许多听众在其中听到了狗哨声：阿尔丁歌词所认可的“好男孩”私刑主义在历史上一直与<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2022/02/america-lynching-history-reckoning/621320/">白人至上主义暴力</a>联系在一起。他的音乐录影带包含“黑人生命也是命”抗议者的图像（尽管该片段<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/25/jason-aldean-controversial-music-video-edited/">后来被剪辑掉</a>），并在 1927 年田纳西州法院前拍摄，一名黑人在那里被私刑处决。（制作该视频的制作公司告诉<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2023/07/20/jason-aldean-song-video-pulled-cmt-controversy/"><em>《华盛顿邮报》</em></a>说它选择了“纳什维尔以外的热门拍摄地点。”）但对这首歌的批评只会放大它：乡村音乐电视台禁止该视频后，该曲目的流媒体量<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/jason-aldean-small-town-song-streaming-increase">猛增了 999%</a> 。<br><br> <a

href="https://twitter.com/Jason_Aldean/status/1681382697875144717?lang=en">说</a>，这首歌只是“代表了我成长过程中对社区的感受”。 （无论如何，阿尔丁是在佐治亚州梅肯市的中等城市长大的。）这种坚持，比阿尔丁声音中南方轻快的声音更能让田径运动变得<em>乡村化</em>。阿尔丁所遵循的音乐传统是蔑视城市，同时颂扬乡村的干劲。但他并没有像梅尔·哈格德（Merle Haggard）的《Okie From Muskogee》那样讽刺而勇敢地演唱，甚至不像小汉克·威廉姆斯（Hank Williams Jr.）的《乡村男孩能生存》（A Country Boy Can Survive）那样生硬自信。他也没有像<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/toby-keith-the-bus-songs/540654/">托比·基思那样</a>发出挑衅性的口号。相反，阿尔丁听起来以一种明显的后垃圾摇滚方式沉迷和恐惧——尽管他的言语表明了行动。<br><br>也许这种升华的焦虑氛围反映了歌曲背后的悲剧：美国小镇长达数十年的经济衰退。阿尔丁感叹的大城市问题—— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-two-decade-red-state-murder-problem">暴力犯罪</a>、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/05/23/how-my-hometown-produced-jan-6-sedition-suspect/">煽动叛乱</a>，甚至<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/small-town-economies-culture/543138/">社区关系破裂</a>——在许多情况下，城市外的问题比城市内更严重。这一现实是右翼怨恨的主要驱动力，而与之相关的音乐无论如何都应该带有一丝不安。阿尔丁此前以无忧无虑的乡村生活赞歌而闻名（尽管他 2018 年的单曲《后景小镇》看起来几乎像是乡村梦想的挽歌，但实际上是一首分手歌曲）。 《Small Town》的一个更好的先例是 Staind 2001 年的热门单曲《It&#39;s Been Awhile》：“已经有一段时间了/自从我能昂首挺胸以来。”并非巧合的是，斯坦德的亚伦·刘易斯现在是一位受欢迎的乡村音乐家，也是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article252897928.html">人们记忆中最有影响力的右翼抗议歌手</a>之一。<br><br>摩根·沃伦 (Morgan Wallen) 是 Nickelback 的精神之子，这也并非巧合。摩根·沃伦目前是最受欢迎的乡村音乐人，也是上周热门 100 强歌曲《最后一夜》(Last Night) 的歌手。这支加拿大摇滚乐队以朗朗上口的《How You Remind Me》和《Photograph》而闻名，经常被嘲笑<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/rahm-emanuel-saves-reputation-renounces-nickelback/323749/">为音乐平淡的终极典范</a>。但沃伦毫无歉意地指出该组织的影响力。他的首选制作人乔伊·莫伊 (Joey Moi) 制作了 Nickelback 2000 年代早期的许多热门歌曲，其中包括《Photograph》，然后与他人共同创立了 Big Loud，该公司现在是纳什维尔最热门的唱片公司之一。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/country-music-pandemic-protests-the-chicks-gaslighter/614092/">阅读：乡村音乐不能再隐藏它的问题</a><br><br>Wallen 是一位 30 岁的前<em>《好声音》</em>参赛者，是一位严肃的流行音乐天才，而《Last Night》（自 2 月份发行以来就引起轰动）非常出色（这也解释了为什么它取代了 Aldean 的歌曲登上了 Hot 100 的榜首）今天）。制作的层压性质以及歌手表达对自己的轻微仇恨的方式有一点五分钱乐队的品质，但“最后一夜”主要体现了纳什维尔的一种独立趋势：所谓的嘻哈、现代乡村受到说唱的影响。沃伦用轻快的吉他循环和拍手形成切分节拍，以时髦的口音唱着醉酒的争斗与和解，散发着与德雷克相同的低俗魅力。这里的讽刺是显而易见的：2021 年，沃伦被发现在镜头前说出 N 字词，这导致了一场所谓的“取消”，就像阿尔丁的那样，只会增加他的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/02/morgan-wallen/618137/">听众数量</a>。<br><br>上周全国排名第三的歌曲是卢克·库姆斯 (Luke Combs) 对特雷西·查普曼 (Tracy Chapman) 的《Fast Car》的演绎，也引起了一些争议。它基本上是 1988 年经典歌曲的逐字翻唱，主要区别在于库姆斯粗犷而优美的声音。上个月它在排行榜上开始上升后，一些评论员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-cover/">指出</a>，查普曼和其他黑人女性都没有在乡村音乐领域取得过库姆斯所享受的那种成功。这一观察激起了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-another-week-another-country-music-star-falsely-accused-racism">保守派的不满</a>，这比最初的批评更强烈，可能会提高这首歌的受欢迎程度。正如我的同事康纳·弗里德斯多夫（Conor Friedersdorf） <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/why-is-tracy-chapman-at-the-center-of-a-country-music-controversy/674794/">所说</a>，围绕这首歌的讨论表明，媒体对种族的报道可能会引发更多的混乱，而不是改革。<br><br>但要求这种注重真实性、纯美国风格的观察者避免谈论明显的事实是否站得住脚？上周乡村音乐席卷<em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 的事实是显而易见的。音乐多种多样，但表演者却不然：在阿尔丁的抗议摇滚、沃伦悠闲的说唱流和库姆斯的灵魂民谣翻唱之间，主流乡村音乐的繁荣不是源于声音，而是源于白人、男性和——至少在阿尔丁的例子中——受屈的身份。当然，所有类型都是由人口统计数据定义的。但流媒体技术，更不用说社交和政治媒体，现在奖励了煽动多元化的激情，包括播下分裂的种子。煽动斯坦对斯坦，或右对左，可以证明是有利可图的——至少在短时间内是这样（阿尔丁的歌曲今天在百强单曲榜上从第 1 名跌至第 21 名）。<br><br>其他流派的艺术家将从这一繁荣中吸取教训。就在几天前，阿尔丁出人意料地出现在纳什维尔举行的五分钱乐队音乐会上。 Nickelback 的主唱查德·克罗格 (Chad Kroeger) 从来不因其政治直言不讳而闻名。但那天晚上，他<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/21852/chapter/6#90">更大、时间更长、频率也更高</a>。这场危机的后果将在宏观范围内颠覆人类生存的地点和方式。从日常意义上来说，它也会让我们的生活变得非常非常出汗。<br><br>对于大多数美国人来说，这可能是一个不受欢迎的消息。我们的文化<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-advertisers-convinced-americans-they-smelled-bad-12552404/">并不喜欢流汗</a>。出汗过多的人要避免乘坐地铁； BO是青春期羞耻的标志。历史上不乏这样的例子：人们试图用香水掩盖汗水，通过沐浴将汗水洗掉，或者用塞进衬衫、衣服和帽子的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-advertisers-convinced-americans-they-smelled-bad-12552404/">棉团或橡胶来</a>吸收汗水。没有医学理由的人们选择用肉毒杆菌来麻痹他们的出汗神经。就连李小龙也在 1973 年去世前几个月，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9664576/">通过手术切除了</a>腋下的汗腺，据说是为了避免银幕上出现污点。<br><br>但我们对汗水的蔑视是完全不值得的。汗水对生命至关重要。它可以冷却我们的身体并滋润我们的皮肤；它管理我们的微生物组并发出化学信号。汗水也是人之所以<em>为人</em>的基本要素。没有它，我们就无法在高温下<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248417303652?via%3Dihub">长距离奔跑</a>；没有它，我们就无法在高温下长距离奔跑。我们将无法为我们的大大脑和身体提供动力；我们不会殖民地球上那么多地方。宾夕法尼亚大学的汗水研究员雅娜·坎贝罗夫（Yana Kamberov）说，我们甚至可能要感谢（或归咎于）我们皮肤的裸露。她的团队最近尚未发表的数据表明，随着人类皮肤进化产生越来越多的汗腺，制造毛皮的毛囊消失以腾出空间。马萨诸塞州文理学院的生物人类学家安德鲁·贝斯特认为，汗水是人类进化的“关键里程碑”之一，与大大脑、直立行走以及通过语言和艺术表达文化同等重要。<br><br>人类并不是唯一会出汗的动物。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248417303652?via%3Dihub">许多哺乳动物</a>——其中包括狗、猫和老鼠——通过爪子上的足垫出汗。黑猩猩、猕猴和其他灵长类动物都被汗腺覆盖。即使是马和骆驼也会在炎热的天气里把皮肤打滑。但只有我们的身体布满了数百万个微小的管状汗腺——大约是其他灵长类动物皮肤上数量的 10 倍——它们将血液中的水分输送到毛孔中，可以挤出<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236237/">三、四</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02640414.2019.1633159">甚至<em>五</em>升</a>以上的水。当我们需要的时候<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/drinking-water-hydration-amount-importance/674926/">——流失太多</a>，中暑和死亡的风险就会急剧上升。我们缺乏皮毛也使我们更容易被咬伤和烧伤。贝斯特告诉我，人类无论如何都会出汗，这证明了出汗具有降温作用——它比仅仅喘气或躲避炎热要有效得多。 “如果你的目标是能够在温暖的条件下维持高代谢率，出汗绝对是<em>最好的</em>，”他说。<br><br> <a

(Angela Lamb) 说。但对 BO 的哀叹早在美国出现之前就有其文化根源。 “我读过很久以前的讨论，其中有关于腋窝臭的人的讨论，”布法罗大学历史学家卡里·卡斯蒂尔说。到了 20 世纪初，最近流行的细菌理论让美国人开始害怕肮脏——这是营销人员“把恐惧先放在女性身上，然后是男性身上，担心出汗会破坏你的浪漫计划的最佳时机”。或者一份工作，” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-joy-of-sweat-the-strange-science-of-perspiration-sarah-everts/9781324022060?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《汗水的乐趣》</em></a>一书的作者莎拉·埃弗茨说道。如今，除臭剂在美国占据了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mordorintelligence.com/industry-reports/north-america-deodorants-market">80 亿美元的市场</a>。<br><br>我们对出汗的厌恶在进化上没有多大意义。与其他引起几乎所有人厌恶的排泄物不同，汗水通常不会传播疾病或造成其他伤害。但它确实会引起体力劳动和情绪压力——这两种情况都是上流社会通常不愿意看到的。密歇根大学生物人类学家蒂娜·拉西西 (Tina Lasisi) 表示，对某些人来说，这可能意味着“以某种特定方式失去对身体的控制”。与尿液或眼泪不同，汗水是身体机能的产物，我们无法训练自己抑制或延迟这种机能。<br><br>我们也讨厌出汗，因为我们认为它闻起来很难闻。但事实并非如此。人体上几乎所有的汗腺都属于所谓的小汗腺类型，并且产生微咸的水，几乎没有气味。腋窝和腹股沟等少数部位长满了顶泌腺，这些腺会产生一种含有信息素的蜡质脂肪物质，但即使是<em>这种物质</em>也没有固有的气味。我们皮肤上的细菌会吃掉它，它们的排泄物会产生恶臭，让汗水成为替罪羊。贝斯特告诉我，我们人类的排汗方式甚至可能让我们“没有原本应有的臭味”。 The expansion of eccrine glands across the body might not have only made our skin barer; it&#39;s also thought to have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248417303652?via%3Dihub">evicted a whole legion of BO-producing apocrine glands</a> .<br><br> As global temperatures climb, for many people—especially in parts of the world that lack access to air-conditioning—sweat will be an inevitability. “I suspect everyone is going to be quite drippy,” Kamberov told me. Exactly how slick each of us will be, though, is anyone&#39;s guess. Experts have evidence that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3328&amp;context=dissertations_2">men sweat more than women, and that perspiration potential declines with age</a> . But by and large, they can&#39;t say with certainty why some people are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306456519302645?via%3Dihub">inherently sweatier than others</a> , and how much of it is inborn. Decades ago, a Japanese researcher hypothesized that perspiration potential might be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306456519302645">calibrated in the first two or three years of life</a> : Kids born into tropical climates, his analyses suggested, might activate more of their sweat glands than children in temperate regions. But Best&#39;s recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ajpa.24723">attempts</a> to replicate those findings have so far come up empty.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2019/11/prince-andrew-says-he-once-didnt-sweat-is-that-possible/602227/">Read: The man who did not sweat</a><br><br> Perspiration does seem to be malleable within a lifetime. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24692142/">couple of weeks</a> into a new, intense exercise regimen, for instance, people will start to sweat<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/heatstress/acclima.html">more and earlier</a> . Over longer periods of time, the body can also learn to tolerate high temperatures, and sweat less copiously but more <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0306456519302645">efficiently</a> . We sense these changes subtly as the seasons shift, says Laure Rittié, a physiologist at Glaxo-Smith Kline, who has studied sweat. It&#39;s part of the reason a 75-degree day might feel toastier—and perhaps sweatier—in the spring than in the fall.<br><br> But we can&#39;t simply sweat our way out of our climatic bind. There&#39;s a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/07/18/extreme-heat-record-limits-human-survival/">ceiling to the temperatures we can tolerate</a> ; the body can leach only so much liquid out at once. Sweat&#39;s cooling power also tends to falter in humid conditions, when liquid can&#39;t evaporate as easily off of skin. Nor can researchers predict whether future generations might evolve to perspire much more than we do now. We no longer live under the intense conditions that pressured our ancestors to sprout more sweat glands—changes that also took place over many millions of years. It&#39;s even possible that we&#39;re fast approaching the maximal moistness a primate body can produce. “We don&#39;t have a great idea about the outer limits of that plasticity,” Jason Kamilar, a biological anthropologist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, told me.<br><br> For now, people who are already on the sweatier side may find themselves better equipped to deal with a warming world, Rittié told me. At long last: Blessed are the moist, for they shall inherit the Earth.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 08 Aug 2023 14:04:03 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/sweat-perspiration-evolution-human-function/674951/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/sweat-perspiration-evolution-human-function/674951/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Gender War Is Over in Britain]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> While upholding trans rights, the Labour Party disassociates itself from radical postmodern theories. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/KyILJbm4emox0dXnrdzRLkVMDno=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/labour_horz/original.jpg" alt="性别符号交错形成一朵花" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> <span class="smallcaps">When Keir Starmer</span> wanted to change the Labour Party&#39;s stance on sex and gender, he didn&#39;t give a set-piece speech or hold a press conference. Instead, the leader of Britain&#39;s main opposition party stayed in the background, leaving Anneliese Dodds, a shadow minister with a low public profile, to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/labour-will-lead-on-reform-of-transgender-rights-and-we-wont-take-lectures-from-the-divisive-tories">announce the shift</a> in a short opinion column in <em>The Guardian</em> . In just over 800 words, she made three big declarations. One was that “sex and gender are different.” Another was that, although Labour continues to believe in the right to change one&#39;s legal gender, safeguards are needed to “protect women and girls from predators who might abuse the system.” Finally, Labour was therefore dropping its commitment to self-ID—the idea that a simple online declaration is enough to change someone&#39;s legal gender for all purposes—and would retain the current requirement of a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.<br><br> Dodds supplemented her article with a few explanatory tweets, but didn&#39;t go on television to reiterate the message. The next day, Labour declined to provide a spokesperson for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001p1nw&amp;sa=D&amp;source=docs&amp;ust=1691432639401313&amp;usg=AOvVaw1lDi1O5V-T3WeyCEmsH19B">comment</a> on the BBC&#39;s flagship radio news show. Although Starmer did eventually answer questions on the subject, as part of a wider <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/keir-starmer-woman-adult-female-trans-labour-party/">interview</a> two days later, the overall effect was that of a man who had chucked a hand grenade over his shoulder and walked away, whistling.<br><br> To anyone not following the turbulent and sometimes arcane debate that has been raging in Britain, Dodds&#39;s statements might sound uncontroversial, but they are not. Since 2015, when the Conservative politician Maria Miller first proposed self-ID in Britain, the idea that such a system might be abused has been called a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2021/07/wi-spa-la-transphobic-protest.html">transphobic</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/dec/15/trans-backlash-anti-gay-zealotry-section-28-homophobia">myth</a> by LGBTQ campaigners. Demands for single-sex sports teams, locker rooms, and prisons were thus “exclusionary” and analogous to whites-only buses, schools, and water fountains under <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newhampshirebulletin.com/2022/05/06/transgender-athletes-and-a-national-history-of-exclusionary-practices-commentary/">apartheid</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/jul/07/cisgender-female-athletes-solidarity-trans-athletes">and</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.syracuse.com/us-news/2016/05/loretta_lynch_north_carolina_bathroom_law_jim_crow_laws.html">Jim Crow</a> . Labour, the main party of the British left, has now declared that these arguments are unfair and untrue.

(Queer activists in the US dismissively call the country “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/bbc-nolan-trans-lgbtiq/">TERF Island</a> .”) Labour&#39;s new stance shows how the left can simultaneously acknowledge the needs of an embattled transgender minority, accept the importance of biological sex to public policy, and look for political and social compromises. Admittedly, huge questions remain about how the party&#39;s proposals will work in practice and whether its Welsh and Scottish branches will fall in line. But Labour has signaled the beginning of a serious democratic conversation, after years of implicitly agreeing with the LGBTQ activists who insisted that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mermaidsuk.org.uk/news/trans-rights-are-not-up-for-debate/">no debate</a> was acceptable.<br><br> As a leader of a left-wing party, Starmer has sent an important sign by disassociating himself from the radical postmodern idea that the distinction between males and females is a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2023/07/the-gender-binary-debate-jacqueline-rose">social construct</a> , and that biology has nothing to do with women&#39;s historical oppression. (“Women are not, in fact, subordinated or oppressed by our bodies,” the feminist legal scholar Catharine MacKinnon wrote <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://signsjournal.org/exploring-transgender-law-and-politics/">recently</a> . “We do not need to be liberated from our chromosomes or our ovaries.”)<br><br> Labour&#39;s new position represents a big ideological shift, but it wasn&#39;t presented as one. That is typical of Starmer&#39;s personality, which is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://helenlewis.substack.com/p/the-bluestocking-starmers-secret">unshowy but ruthless</a> . Unlike many American politicians on either side of the spectrum, he has tried to find a position that will make the debate less inflammatory, and to appeal to the wider country rather than his activist base.<br><br> In the three years since the Conservatives <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/sep/22/uk-government-drops-gender-self-identification-plan-for-trans-people">dropped</a> their commitment to self-ID, some of their <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/tories-should-fight-next-election-29211636">politicians</a> have gleefully seized on the vote-winning potential of gender as a culture-war issue. By contrast, during that time, Starmer and his ministers have been fumbling over their answer to the question <em>What is a woman?</em> , talking about cervices far more than anyone outside a gynecology department would wish to. A desire to stick to the progressive line has meant that Labour politicians have ended up <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://uk.style.yahoo.com/labour-mp-dawn-butler-child-born-without-sex-150324736.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGjJ3Wh5kJtAmdZI9UFHqUUB-x9ZgHcLPdrmXEL5O7fSu8yyXfQDpt_cn4aWevKWa2Ze5NrVPslU2hnSIBC1AN7F1dFHE5DMRiuxxz1hOe7vgGlGePG7YJ0UFMrxnPe7JUWf6TTd98mXd-IpbBaK9FeGagNpbRvVQMbBgUk1AdyO">saying baffling things</a> like “A child is born without sex.” Some have attacked interviewers for even bringing up the subject, which just drew more attention to their tortured answers.

Two days after the Dodds column appeared, Starmer <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/keir-starmer-woman-adult-female-trans-labour-party/">was asked</a> to define <em>woman</em> . He responded simply, “An adult female.” If that answer is permissible in left-wing circles, interviewers have been deprived of an easy gotcha question, and Labour can go back to talking about economics and trying to win over the median voter.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">For fear of</span> harming trans people or aligning with outright bigots, some on the left have avoided voicing misgivings about policies such as self-ID, and over the past decade Labour activists have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/wpuk-fringe-report">vilified</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-officials-quit-in-transgender-row-06qtj2b3r">feminist commentators</a> who did speak up. Starmer has now broadened the limits of the discussion. Across Europe, medical associations are recommending <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/texas-puberty-blockers-gender-care-transgender-rights/673941/">caution</a> over so-called affirmative models of gender care for minors. The possibility that social contagion may affect teenagers&#39; professed identities is being <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.academie-medecine.fr/la-medecine-face-a-la-transidentite-de-genre-chez-les-enfants-et-les-adolescents/?lang=en">discussed</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o629/rr-1">among doctors</a> , as is the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/gender-dysphoria-in-young-people-is-rising-and-so-is-professional-disagreement/">suggestion</a> that, at least in some cases, puberty itself can resolve gender dysphoria.

The latest organization to change its rules is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/british-rowing-ban-transgender-athletes-womens-events-telegraph-2023-08-02/">British Rowing</a> , which has restricted women&#39;s events to biological females, while also creating categories for transgender participation. Two weeks before that, cycling&#39;s world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.skysports.com/more-sports/other-sports/news/15264/12921233/uci-to-ban-transgender-women-from-participating-in-female-cycling-events-under-new-policy#:~:text=The%20policy%20created%20an%20'open,yet%20to%20begin%20hormone%20therapy.">restricted</a> the female category to individuals born female who have never taken testosterone, while also creating an “open” competition for anyone who has been through male puberty or has taken male hormones.<br><br> In the United States, though, political polarization is freezing a highly unproductive discussion in place. One of the most frustrating aspects of writing on this subject is that many liberals don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know. Punitive red-state bans, coupled with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ron-desantis-cnn-interview/674751/">overtly anti-LGBTQ rhetoric</a> by Republicans, have made Democrats instinctively defensive of puberty blockers and gender surgery for minors even as European experts grow warier. A proper, evidence-based debate about child transition in America is inhibited by the fact that medical groups are wedded to the affirmative model, despite their overseas colleagues&#39; qualms about the evidence base. The board of the American Academy of Pediatrics just <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/health/aap-gender-affirming-care-evidence-review.html">voted unanimously</a> to continue backing the affirmative approach for now.<br><br> Clearly, a broad middle ground exists. About three-quarters of Americans are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/05/05/trans-poll-gop-politics-laws/">opposed</a> to discrimination against transgender people in housing, colleges, the workplace, and obtaining health insurance, according to polling conducted late last year. But more than 60 percent of American adults also believe that trans women and girls should not compete in female sports at any level, and solid majorities also oppose hormone treatments for under-18s. Even among trans adults themselves, the same poll found that three in 10 support sex-based restrictions in sports, and the same number said it was inappropriate for younger children to receive puberty blockers. ( <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em> , which published the polling, notes that it was conducted before the introduction of hundreds of red-state bills restricting medical care and sports participation.) It seems as though most Americans are happy to support trans people in everyday life, while also believing that trans women are not identical to other women, with all that implies. But this position is rarely articulated among elites on either side. “It&#39;s not just tribalism; it&#39;s extremism,” the writer Lisa Selin Davis told me. “It&#39;s the two-party system, and it&#39;s each party catering to its most radical constituents. And of course, that&#39;s the story of social media too.”<br><br> Davis came to the American gender debate as the parent of a masculine daughter. When she wrote about that experience in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/opinion/my-daughter-is-not-transgender-shes-a-tomboy.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> , she received letters urging her to let her “son” transition and warning that “he” might die by suicide otherwise. She still considers herself to be on the left but believes that her natural allies have lost perspective. “When it comes to the Democrats, they have invested so much political capital in supporting things that not only probably don&#39;t matter to most Democratic voters, but I think probably are a bit of a turnoff,” she told me. “Staking your claim on supporting drag-queen story hour, as opposed to a $25 minimum wage, is really silly.”<br><br> Davis is particularly dispirited that Democrats do not make life easy for lawmakers who depart from the party&#39;s orthodoxy on gender issues. Shawn Thierry, a Black female Democratic state representative in Texas, faced censure motions and a primary challenge after <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/houston-democrat-transgender-care-ban-18100564.php">supporting</a> a Republican bill to limit gender-related hormone therapies to people over 18. Her Democratic colleagues accused her of parroting GOP talking points, but she insisted that she had looked at the evidence and found it wanting. Her detractors were also unhappy that she met with two detransitioners ahead of the vote. Imagine that—a lawmaker being criticized for listening to people with personal experience of the issue under discussion.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/detransition-transgender-nonbinary-gender-affirming-care/672745/">Daniela Valdes and Kinnon MacKinnon: Take detransitioners seriously</a><br><br> Deviations from the Republican Party line also attract ferocious pushback. In 2021, Asa Hutchinson, then the governor of Arkansas, vetoed a child-gender-care bill, drawing criticism from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/tucker-carlson-asa-hutchinson-tussle-transgender-rights-vaccines-rcna94305">Tucker Carlson</a> and the state party. But Hutchinson gave a compelling rationale: He opposed surgeries on minors but felt the bill was unconstitutional and deprived parents of their rights. (His veto was overturned, but the law has since been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-strikes-gender-affirming-care-ban-arkansas/story?id=100257964">struck down</a> by a judge.) Earlier this year, Utah Governor Spencer Cox <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.yahoo.com/disagree-better-utah-governor-wants-143000349.html">approved</a> restrictions on transition care in his state only <em>after</em> meeting with families affected by the change, telling reporters: “If you&#39;re not willing to sit down and listen to transgender kids and their families, then you&#39;re probably doing policy the wrong way.” Cox is now using his year as chair of the National Governors Association to promote an initiative called Disagree Better.<br><br> Here in Britain, Starmer is betting that most voters will gratefully accept his proposed compromise—one that both assuages their concerns and takes some of the heat out of the debate. Labour has made concessions to trans activists, too, by proposing a system that will allow patients to receive a dysphoria diagnosis from their family doctor, rather than having to apply to an anonymous panel. Starmer has so far declined <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/07/25/keir-starmer-owes-rosie-duffield-an-apology/">to apologize</a> on the party&#39;s behalf to feminists who were harassed for views that Labour now officially shares.<br><br> Frankly, treating this as a tough but mundane problem to be solved rather than an emotive means of attacking the opposition is what is needed. It&#39;s the only way to make the American conversation around gender more like the British one. Democrats need to meet detransitioners, and Republicans need to meet transgender activists. Both sides need to hear the best version of their opponents&#39; arguments—and ensure that the debate is being conducted on the basis of the best available evidence. Alongside any evidence reviews, Davis wants a bipartisan commission on child gender care. “The best thing to do would be to stop fighting and get the data,” she said.<br><br> Until then, the left must be able to defend trans rights without denying the meaningful differences between males and females. The right must be able to air concerns without demonizing trans people. Both liberals and conservatives should stop throwing around accusations of child abuse toward parents doing their best. The gender war can end—if the broad, tolerant middle asserts itself.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 08 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/uk-trans-rights-labour-party/674944/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/uk-trans-rights-labour-party/674944/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Local-News Crisis Is Weirdly Easy to Solve]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Restoring the journalism jobs lost over the past 20 years wouldn&#39;t just be cheap—it would pay for itself. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OxjtWxqBQ3MegS-BPLwSTdRukEI=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/local_news_final_horz/original.jpg" alt="装满钱的报刊箱" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic.

He did not discover secret torture sites or expose abuses by a powerful religious institution. But there was something about this one article he wrote as a reporter for <i>The Salt Lake Tribune</i> in 2019 that changed my conception of the value of local news.<br><br> Podmore, then a staff journalist for the <i>Tribune</i> and a corps member of Report for America, a nonprofit I co-founded, published a story <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/07/28/san-juan-county-paid/">revealing</a> that San Juan County, Utah, had paid a single law firm hundreds of thousands of dollars in lobbying fees. Among other things, Podmore found that the firm had overcharged the county, the poorest in the state, by $109,500. Spurred by his story, the firm paid the money back. Perhaps because it didn&#39;t involve billions of dollars, but rather a more imaginable number, it struck me: In one story, Podmore had retrieved for the county a sum that was triple his annual salary.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/alden-global-capital-killing-americas-newspapers/620171/">From the November 2021 Issue: A secretive hedge fund is gutting newsrooms</a><br><br> You&#39;ve probably read about the collapse of local news over the past two decades. On average, two newspapers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/research/state-of-local-news/report/">close</a> each week. Some 1,800 communities that used to have local news now <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/news-deserts-and-ghost-newspapers-will-local-news-survive/the-news-landscape-in-2020-transformed-and-diminished/">don&#39;t</a> . Many of the papers still hanging on are forced to make do with skeleton staffs as their owners, often private-equity firms, seek to cut costs. The number of newspaper newsroom employees dropped by 57 percent from 2008 to 2020, according to a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/07/13/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-fallen-26-since-2008/">Pew Research study</a> , leading to thousands of “ghost newspapers” that barely cover their community.<br><br> For the past 15 years, I have been part of an effort to reverse this trend. That means I&#39;ve grown used to talking about the threat that news deserts pose to American democracy. After all, the whole concept of democratic self-government depends on the people knowing what public officials are up to. That&#39;s impossible without a watchdog press. Researchers have linked the decline of local news to decreased voter participation and higher rates of corruption, along with increased polarization and more ideologically extreme elected officials. At this point, I can make high-minded speeches about this stuff in my sleep, with Thomas Jefferson quotes and everything. Recently, however, I&#39;ve come to realize that I have been ignoring a less lofty but perhaps more persuasive argument: Funding local news would more than pay for itself.<br><br> Unlike other seemingly intractable problems, the demise of local news wouldn&#39;t cost very much money to reverse. Journalists are not particularly well compensated. Assuming an average salary of $60,000 (generous by industry standards), it would cost only about $1.5 billion a year to sustain 25,000 local-reporter positions, a rough estimate of the number that have disappeared nationwide over the past two decades. That&#39;s two-hundredths of a percent of federal spending in 2022. I personally think this would be an amount well worth sacrificing to save American democracy. But the amazing thing is that it wouldn&#39;t really be a sacrifice at all. If more public or philanthropic money were directed toward sustaining local news, it would most likely produce financial benefits many times greater than the cost.<br><br> What do government officials do when no one&#39;s watching? Often, they enrich themselves or their allies at the taxpayers&#39; expense. In the 2000s, some years after its local paper shut down, the city of Bell, California, a low-income, overwhelmingly Latino community, raised the pay of the city manager to $787,637 and that of the police chief to $457,000. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> eventually <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-bell-salary-20100715-story.html">exposed</a> the graft, and several city officials ended up in prison. Prosecutors accused them of costing taxpayers at least $5.5 million through their inflated salaries. These salaries were approved at municipal meetings, which is to say that if even one reporter (say, with a salary of $60,000) had been in attendance, the city might have saved millions of dollars.<br><br> Sometimes the work of journalists prompts government investigations into the private sector, which, in turn, produce fines that go into the public&#39;s bank account. After the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2022/05/09/tampa-bay-times-reporters-win-pulitzer-prize-for-poisoned-series/">found</a> that a battery recycler was exposing its employees and the surrounding community to high levels of lead and other toxins, regulators fined the company $800,000. A ProPublica <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/sec-issues-more-fines-over-magnetar-deals-and-appears-to-move-on">investigation</a> into one firm&#39;s questionable mortgage-backed securities prompted investigations by the Security and Exchange Commission, which ultimately assessed $435 million in fines. A review of more than 12,000 entries in the Investigative Reporters and Editors Awards found that about one in 10 triggered fines from the government, and twice as many prompted audits.<br><br> In other cases, local-news organizations return money directly to consumers by forcing better behavior from private institutions. MLK50, a local newsroom in Memphis, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/what-happens-after-a-debt-collection-machine-grinds-to-a-halt">teamed up</a> with ProPublica to report that Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare had sued more than 8,300 people, many of them poor, for unpaid hospital bills. In response, the faith-based institution erased nearly $12 million in debt.<br><br> Of course, most journalism does not convert quite so immediately into cash on hand. The impacts may be enormous but indirect. One study of toxic emissions at 40,000 plants <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069616301371">found</a> that when newspapers reported on pollution, emissions declined by 29 percent compared with plants that were not covered. The study did not track the ripple effects, but it stands to reason that residents in the less polluted areas would have fewer health problems, which in turn would translate to lower medical costs and less lost work time. Another <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3175555">study</a> , by the scholars Pengjie Gao, Chang Lee, and Dermot Murphy, looked at bond offerings in communities with and without local news from 1996 to 2015. It concluded that for each bond offering, the borrowing costs were five to 11 basis points higher in the less covered communities. That translated to additional costs of $650,000 an issue, on average.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/local-news-media-trust-americans/618895/">Amanda Ripley: Can the news be fixed?</a><br><br> One academic tried to track the economic effects even further downstream.

The exposé prompted LA County to require restaurants to display their inspection scores, which in turn led to a 13.3 percent drop in LA County hospital admissions for food poisoning. Hamilton estimated a savings of about $148,000. In another case study, Hamilton analyzed a series by the Raleigh <i>News &amp; Observer</i> that found that, because the state criminal-justice system didn&#39;t adequately keep track of those under supervision, 580 people on probation in North Carolina killed someone from 2000 to 2008. After the state implemented reforms, murders committed by people on probation declined. Applying the statistical “value of human life” used by the US Department of Transportation, Hamilton concluded that society saved about $62 million in just the first year after the policy changes. The series cost only about $200,000 to produce.<br><br> Ideally, investment in local news would come from the federal government, which has more freedom to think long-term than cash-strapped states and municipalities do. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rebuildlocalnews.org/">The Rebuild Local News coalition</a> , of which I am president, supports legislation that would provide a refundable tax credit for news organizations that employ local reporters, and a tax break for small businesses that advertise in local news.

Civic-minded philanthropists focused on high-impact donations should also put money into local news, given the likely societal returns. It&#39;s impossible to quantify exactly how much money would be generated for government and consumers by restoring the health of local news. But it&#39;s nearly as hard to deny that the investment would pay off handsomely. And the saving-democracy part?

The two men, both 26, had been close friends since preschool. They&#39;d just returned to West Philadelphia after a few days hang gliding, zip-lining, and hiking in Puerto Rico. Jackson was parked outside his mom&#39;s house when a black SUV pulled up and the people inside started shooting. Both he and McCaskill were pronounced dead at the hospital.<br><br> In the aftermath, McCaskill&#39;s mother, Najila Zainab Ali McCaskill, couldn&#39;t fathom why anyone would want to kill her son and his friend. Both had beaten the odds for young Black men in their neighborhood and graduated from college. Jackson had been a mental-health technician in an adolescent psych ward while her son had run a small cleaning business and tended bar. She wondered if they&#39;d been targeted by a disgruntled former employee of the cleaning business. But then the police explained: Her son and his friend had been killed because of a clash on social media among some teenagers they&#39;d never even met.<br><br> For months, a battle had been raging on Instagram between crews based on either side of Market Street. Theirs was a long-running rivalry, but a barrage of online taunts and threats had raised tensions in the neighborhood. Police had assigned an officer to monitor the social-media activity of various crews in the city, and the department suspected that the Northsiders in the SUV had mistaken one of the two friends for a rival Southsider and opened fire. An hour after the shooting, a Northsider posted a photo on Instagram with a caption that appeared to mock the victims and encourage the rival crew to collect their bodies: “AHH HAAAA Pussy Pick Em Up!!”<br><br> Jackson and McCaskill died in the first year of a nationwide resurgence in violence that has erased more than two decades of gains in public safety. In 2020, homicides spiked by 30 percent and fluctuated around that level for the next two years. There are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/us-murder-rate-decline-crime-statistics/674290/">early signs</a> that the 2023 rate could show a decrease of more than 10 percent from last year, but that would still leave it well above pre-pandemic levels.<br><br> Criminologists point to a confluence of factors, including the social disruptions caused by COVID‑19, the rise in gun sales early in the pandemic, and the uproar following the murder of George Floyd, which, in many cities, led to diminished police activity and further erosion of trust in the police. But in my reporting on the surge, I kept hearing about another accelerant: social media.<br><br> Violence-prevention workers described feuds that started on Instagram, Snapchat, and other platforms and erupted into real life with terrifying speed. “When I was young and I would get into an argument with somebody at school, the only people who knew about it were me and the people at school,” said James Timpson, a violence-prevention worker in Baltimore. “Not right now. Five hundred people know about it before you even leave school. And then you got this big war going on.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/04/american-teens-sadness-depression-anxiety/629524/">Read: Why American teens are so sad</a><br><br> Smartphones and social platforms existed long before the homicide spike; they are obviously not its singular cause. But considering the recent past, it&#39;s not hard to see why social media might be a newly potent driver of violence. When the pandemic led officials to close civic hubs such as schools, libraries, and rec centers for more than a year, people—especially young people—were pushed even further into virtual space. Much has been said about the possible links between heavy social-media use and mental-health problems and suicide among teenagers. Now Timpson and other violence-prevention workers are carrying that concern to the logical next step. If social media plays a role in the rising tendency of young people to harm themselves, could it also be playing a role when they harm others?<br><br> The current spike in violence isn&#39;t a return to &#39;90s-era murder rates—it&#39;s something else entirely. In many cities, the violence has been especially concentrated among the young. The nationwide homicide rate for 15-to-19-year-olds <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db471.htm">increased by an astonishing 91 percent</a> from 2014 to 2021. Last year in Washington, DC, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/31/homicides-dc-va-md-2022/">105 people under 18 were shot</a> —nearly twice as many as in the previous year. In Philadelphia in the first nine months of 2022, the tally of youth shooting victims—181— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/local/philadelphia/2022/10/05/philadelphia-gun-violence-youth-victims">equaled the tally for all of 2015 and 2016 combined</a> . And in Baltimore, more than 60 children ages 13 to 18 were shot in the first half of this year. That&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/criminal-justice/teen-shootings-gun-violence-baltimore-UW47CTUZVVFCZDMHUVZOY3WGJQ/">double the totals for the first half of each year from 2015 to 2021</a> —and it&#39;s occurred while overall homicides in the city declined. Nationwide, this trend has been racially disproportionate to an extreme degree: In 2021, Black people ages 10 to 24 were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121555">almost 14 times more likely to be the victims of a homicide</a> than young white people.<br><br> Those confronting this scourge—police, prosecutors, intervention workers—are adamant that social-media instigation helps explain why today&#39;s young people are making up a larger share of the victims. But they&#39;re at a loss as to how to combat this phenomenon. They understand that this new wave of killing demands new solutions—but what are they?<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">To the extent</span> that online incitement has drawn attention, it&#39;s been focused on rap videos, particularly those featuring <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/jayquan-mckenley-chii-wvtzz-eric-adams-drill.html#_ga=2.8250674.1462920847.1690910851-270587328.1687895713">drill music</a> , which started in Chicago in the early 2010s and is dominated by explicit baiting of “opps,” or rivals. These videos have been linked to numerous shootings. Often, though, conflict is sparked by more mundane online activity. Teens bait rivals in Instagram posts or are goaded by allies in private chats. On Instagram and Facebook, they livestream incursions into enemy territory and are met by challenges to “drop a pin”—to reveal their location or be deemed a coward. They brandish guns in Snapchat photos or YouTube and TikTok videos, which might provoke an opp to respond—and pressure the person with the gun to actually use it.<br><br> “If you&#39;re not monitoring social media, you&#39;re wondering why 1,000 people are suddenly downtown fighting.”<br><br> In December, I met 21-year-old Brandon Olivieri at the state prison in Houtzdale, Pennsylvania, where he is serving time for murder. In 2017, Olivieri says, he had a run-in with other teens in South Philadelphia after he tried to sell marijuana on their turf. Later, in a private Instagram chat for Olivieri and his friends, someone posted a picture of a silver .45-caliber pistol. Then another member, Nicholas Torelli, posted a picture of cat feces on the sidewalk, with the caption “Brandon took a shit on opp territory.” It was a joke, but the conversation quickly turned aggressive. Later that day, Olivieri asked Torelli to drop an image of their opponents into the chat, so everyone could see what they looked like. Torelli complied, and, according to court records, Olivieri replied that he would “pop all of them.”<br><br> When Olivieri, Torelli, and two friends encountered four of their opponents later that month, there were heated words, a struggle, and three gunshots from the silver pistol. One bullet struck Caleer Miller, a member of Olivieri&#39;s group. Another hit Salvatore DiNubile, in the other crew. Both died; they were 16. Olivieri was convicted of first-degree murder in DiNubile&#39;s death and third-degree murder in Miller&#39;s. (Torelli testified against Olivieri and was not charged.) Olivieri was sentenced to 37 years to life.<br><br> DiNubile&#39;s father, also named Salvatore, believes the ability to share threats online encouraged Olivieri and his friends to make them; having made them, they felt compelled to follow through. “You said you were gonna do this guy. Here&#39;s your chance,” he told me. “You try to live up to this gangster mentality that he&#39;s self-created.” Olivieri maintains his innocence and says that he wasn&#39;t the one who fired the fatal shots, but he agreed that he and his friends often hyped one another up by making boasts online. “It&#39;s what we call pump-faking,” he explained.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Last year,</span> as the number of juvenile shooting victims in Washington, DC, climbed toward triple digits, the city&#39;s Peace Academy, which trains community members in violence prevention, held a Zoom session dedicated to social media. Ameen Beale of the DC Attorney General&#39;s Office shared his screen to display a sequence typical of online flare-ups culminating in a fatality.<br><br> The presentation started with a photo, posted to Instagram in 2019, showing the local rapper AhkDaClicka on the Metro; the caption mocked him for being caught there, without a gun, by adversaries. Then came a screenshot of private messages between AhkDaClicka and a rival rapper named Walkdown Will that the latter posted derisively on Instagram Live. Next, an Instagram Story from AhkDaClicka insulting another rapper who had allegedly been present at the Metro run-in, and a YouTube video of AhkDaClicka <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFxpUO0J9E4">rapping about the incident</a> , including the line “Just give me a Glock and point me to the opps.” Soon afterward, in January 2020, AhkDaClicka was fatally shot. He was 18; his real name was Malick Cisse. That May, police arrested Walkdown Will—William Whitaker, also 18. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last October.<br><br> Beale&#39;s presentation left some participants dumbfounded. “I cannot believe the level of immaturity and stupidity that&#39;s become the norm,” one wrote in the chat. Another asked the question looming over the session: Had anyone in the city&#39;s violence-prevention realm asked the social-media companies to limit inflammatory content?<br><br> “I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve made much progress,” Beale admitted. When the city had sought to have posts removed, he said, the companies had rebuffed its pleas with vague arguments about free speech. Even if social-media platforms did remove a post, 20 people could already have shared it with hundreds or thousands more. And given the pace of online life, you might spend five years trying to block harmful content on one platform, only for all the activity to migrate to another.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/social-media-teen-mental-health-crisis-research-limitations/674371/">Read: No one knows exactly what social media is doing to teens</a><br><br> I asked a spokesperson for Google, which owns YouTube, about the AhkDaClicka video with the line about the Glock, as well as another video posted last summer, titled “Pull Da Plug.” It showed a Louisville, Kentucky, rapper and about a dozen other young men apparently celebrating a shooting that had left a man on life support (he later died). The head of the Louisville violence-prevention agency had told me that the victim&#39;s family asked Google to remove the video, but it stayed up, collecting more than 15,000 views. The spokesperson, Jack Malon, told me the company generally had a “pretty high threshold” for determining that music videos were inciting violence, in part because company policy <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268#zippy=%2Cother-types-of-content-that-violate-this-policy">allows exceptions for artistic content</a> .<br><br> My conversations with Malon and his counterparts at Snap and Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) left me with the impression that social-media platforms have given relatively little thought to their role in fueling routine gun violence, compared with the higher-profile debate over censoring incendiary political speech. Meta pointed me to its “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards">community standards</a> ,” which are full of gray-area statements such as “We also try to consider the language and context in order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat to public or personal safety.” Snap argued that its platform was more benign than others, because posts are designed to disappear and are viewed primarily by one&#39;s friends. I also reached out to TikTok, but the company didn&#39;t respond.<br><br> Communities, meanwhile, have been left to fend for themselves. But violence-prevention groups are dominated by middle-aged men who grew up in the pre-smartphone era; they&#39;re more comfortable intervening in person than deciphering threats on TikTok. Before the pandemic, an intern at Pittsburgh&#39;s main anti-violence organization scanned social-media posts by young people considered at risk of becoming involved in conflicts. The Reverend Cornell Jones, the city government&#39;s liaison to violence-prevention groups, told me that the intern had once detected a feud brewing online among teenagers, some of whom had acquired firearms. Jones brought in the participants and their mothers and defused the situation. Then the intern left town for law school and the organization reverted to the ad hoc methods that are more typical for such groups. “If you&#39;re not monitoring social media, you&#39;re wondering why 1,000 people are suddenly downtown fighting,” Jones said ruefully. In early July, a shooting at a block party in Baltimore validated his concern: Though the event had been discussed widely on social media, no police officers were on hand; later, a video circulated of a teenager showing off what appeared to be a gun at the party. The shooting left two dead and 28 others wounded.<br><br> A decade ago, Desmond Upton Patton, a professor of social policy, communications, and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, got the first of several grants to study what he called “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563212003779">internet banging</a> .” His research team co-designed algorithms with a team at Columbia University to analyze language, images, and even emoji on Twitter and identify users at risk of harming themselves or others. The algorithms showed promise in identifying escalating online disputes. But he never allowed their use, worried about their resemblance to police surveillance efforts that had enabled profiling more than prevention. “Perhaps there is a smarter person who can figure out how to do it ethically,” he said to me.<br><br> For now, the system is failing to anticipate violence—and even, quite often, to convict people whose social-media feeds incriminate them. In May, three teens were tried for the murders of Jarell Jackson and Shahjahan McCaskill in Philadelphia. At the time of the shooting, two were 17 and the third was 16. Social-media activity formed a key part of the prosecutors&#39; evidence: Instagram posts and video feeds showed the three defendants driving around in a black SUV seemingly identical to the one that had pulled up alongside Jackson&#39;s car. Other posts showed two of them holding a gun that matched the description of one used in the shooting. After a day of deliberations, the jury acquitted them of murder, finding two of the defendants guilty only of weapons charges. The verdict left the victims&#39; families reeling. “For me and my family, [the trial] was like a seven-day funeral,” Monique Jackson, Jarell&#39;s mother, told me. Afterward, the detective who had investigated the murders speculated to her that jurors on such cases often struggle to grasp the basic mechanics of social media and how essential it is to the interactions of young people. As Patton put it to me, “What we underestimate time and time again is that social media isn&#39;t virtual versus real life. This <i>is</i> life.”<br><br> <em><small>This article has been updated to clarify YouTube&#39;s policy for determining which videos are removed for inciting violence.</small></em><br><br> <small><em>This article is a collaboration between</em> The Atlantic <em>and ProPublica.

Sources: Getty; Library of Congress.</figcaption></figure> “I <span class="smallcaps">t&#39;s almost like</span> the government&#39;s imposing its will on its residents,” Trayon White, the DC council member for Ward 8, said at the council&#39;s June 6 legislative meeting. He wasn&#39;t talking about a proposed highway, a subway station, a power plant, or— <em>perish the thought</em> —an apartment building. He was talking about trees: specifically, three linden trees on Xenia Street planted a few years ago by DC&#39;s Urban Forestry Division. To my surprise, the legislative body of a major American city experiencing escalating <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/05/05/dc-homeless-annual-count/">homelessness</a> and a serious spike in violent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/district-crime-data-glance">crime</a> dedicated a quarter of its time that day to discussing three trees.<br><br> White said he was concerned about the potential risk to property values and what he sees as a “reasonable fear” that once mature, the trees would “be large enough to make it difficult to see through and around the walkway, which is a public-safety concern.” He asked his colleagues to support an emergency resolution to remove them before this happened.<br><br> For a while, the members carried on as though this were a perfectly normal matter for their attention. A few suggested that perhaps expanding the tree canopy was good, actually. But no one really questioned the underlying premise of White&#39;s proposal: that the community had risen up in dendrophobic opposition.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/07/social-trees-meg-lowman-suzanne-simard/619015/">From the July/August 2021 issue: A better way to look at trees</a><br><br> “We want to note that these are homeowners who are worried about the value of their homes,” White said. “I just believe that [the District Department of Transportation, or DDOT] can be more friendly in responding to the needs of the community with their request, and if they&#39;re requesting different trees, I don&#39;t see what the big problem is.”<br><br> The council went on to debate the merits of the public-safety question. Councilman Kenyan McDuffie recalled that in his ward the city had planted trees in parking spaces so as not to encroach on the already narrow sidewalks. “I still question whether there is the appropriate level of consultation and engagement in the impacted communities,” he said, backing White.<br><br> After more than 20 minutes, the chair of the council noted with surprise that “we spent this much time on the issue of removing three trees.” White, recognizing the lack of sufficient support from his colleagues, withdrew the matter from the agenda, allowing the trees to grow another day.<br><br> What initially drew me to this story was the obvious mismatch between the rhetoric at the council meeting and the subject at hand. How could a few trees constitute a threat to public safety or property values? Were these trees particularly ugly? And <em>who</em> was behind White&#39;s push to get them removed? Like many stories about government, this seemingly trivial drama turned out to be about power, and how people justify using it.<br><br> X <span class="smallcaps">enia Street</span> is in Ward 8, physically separated from most of DC by the Anacostia River. That&#39;s not the only thing that sets it apart. This side of the river is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/61000US11008-ward-8-dc/">overwhelmingly Black</a> and has a higher unemployment rate, a lower labor-force-participation rate, and a higher poverty rate than the rest of the city. The census tract that contains Xenia Street is one of the most heat sensitive in the city, a metric that reflects the prevalence of asthma, coronary heart disease, and disability, as well as racial demographics and income. DC&#39;s Urban Forestry Department, a division of DDOT, planted the trees after a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/emerald-ash-borer/emerald-ash-borer-beetle#:~:text=The%20Emerald%20Ash%20Borer%20(Agrilus,hidden%20in%20wood%20packing%20materials.">beetle infestation</a> harmed several local ash trees. A senior official told me the department is generally concerned about the unequal distribution of tree canopy across wards: At the end of June, Ward 8 had roughly 500 open requests for new plantings; the higher-income Ward 4 had nearly 6,000.<br><br> Tree planting doesn&#39;t meet the bar for more serious types of notification and community-input processes that a new road or train station might. But according to Kay Armstead, a former member of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission—an elected body meant to serve as a hyperlocal voice on zoning, bike lanes, liquor licenses—the city did inform the commission of a plan to bring more trees to the neighborhood. In the fall of 2020, it planted 35 trees, some American linden, some apple, on a publicly owned lot between two condo buildings, 450 Xenia Street and 450 Condon Terrace.<br><br> I wanted to see the trees for myself. In the weeks following White&#39;s proposed emergency resolution, I visited the quiet residential street on three separate occasions, asking people if they had any thoughts about the trees. No one I interviewed registered strong opinions, or had even heard of the controversy.<br><br> One resident of 450 Condon Terrace immediately redirected my attention to a massive hole in the ground of her parking lot, which she said had been caused by a garbage truck. Another told me he hadn&#39;t heard about the controversy but wanted to talk about trash pickup. “I mean, look at this shit,” he said, pointing to a pile of trash on the sidewalk. Trees? Low on the list of priorities. Another man found my line of questioning confusing, to say the least. “They&#39;re oxygen!” When I said some people worried the trees could encourage crime, he laughed at me. “Now, you know that&#39;s crazy. Who&#39;s going to hide underneath these trees?”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/big-little-ideas-start-planting-trees/622142/">James Fallows: Start planting trees</a><br><br> So who forms “the community” so opposed to the trees? His name is Darryl Ross.<br><br> Ross has been active in local politics for decades. He is treasurer of the Ward 8 Democrats and of White&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/just-a-quarter-of-dc-constituent-service-funds-provided-assistance-report-finds/2019/03/26/191d0f80-4fc8-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f_story.html">constituent-services fund</a> , a controversial purse that some critics have called a “slush fund.” When White refers to constituent outreach to his office over this issue, he&#39;s talking about Ross. (White and his chief of staff both declined to be interviewed for this story.) Ross doesn&#39;t live at 450 Xenia Street, but he used to. He still owns a unit in the building, which he rents out, and is the president of the Xenia Condominium Owners Association.<br><br> Ross has been angry about the trees since the day they were planted. He told me he saw workers digging and began calling around, furious that no one had informed the neighborhood about the project, astounded that the city thought 35 trees (“a forest!”) made sense on the street, and frustrated by hypothetical future private costs that the trees would impose on residents.<br><br> His 311 requests to remove the trees went nowhere. So he tried officials at DDOT and the Urban Forestry Department, White and several other members of the city council, the office of the inspector general, and current and former members of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission. He knows he wouldn&#39;t have been able to get so much attention without his connections: “Believe me, I&#39;m using all the leverage I can to get the desired result,” he told me.<br><br> After months of effort, in August of 2021, representatives from DDOT, White&#39;s chief of staff, and a senior staffer for at-large Council Member Anita Bonds met with Ross and a couple of area residents on the site to discuss the problem. The officials agreed to remove 14 of the 35 newly planted trees. The agency also promised to complete a lighting survey, which resulted in the installation of three large streetlights, a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/projects/crime-lights-study">data-driven approach to reducing crime</a> .<br><br> The “desire to compromise for this individual is because we want to make sure we&#39;re doing this <em>for</em> people, not <em>to</em> them,” a senior official in the Urban Forestry department (who requested anonymity to speak freely) told me. “If we can mollify someone, engender a sense of ownership … You take someone and make them more of an ally.”<br><br> Ross was not mollified. He continued his crusade to have three more trees removed—the ones closest to his condo building&#39;s walkway. He lodged a complaint with DC&#39;s Office of the Inspector General, which led to a formal response from DDOT Director Everett Lott, who argued that the department had broken no laws in planting the trees and had in fact exceeded the mandate for public notification. Undeterred, Ross continued his advocacy, which culminated with White&#39;s proposed emergency resolution at the city-council meeting in June.<br><br> Ross put me in touch with a few of his allies, most of whom sounded only slightly more informed about the situation than the residents I randomly encountered on my visits. Some had no idea that many trees had already been removed; others were just vaguely aware that at one point the trees had seemed like a problem. One woman told me she thought children might throw fallen apples at cars or building windows. (The trees at issue in the emergency legislation are linden, not apple.)<br><br> According to Ross, the condo association was united in opposition. He called the vice president, Hazel Farmer, on speaker in my presence.<br><br> “You remember there were four [trees] that were too close to the walkway?”他问。<br><br> “I thought we had finished that,” she said, sounding confused.<br><br> “No, no, we are still battling,” Ross replied quickly.<br><br> After Ross refreshed her memory, Farmer said she worried that the trees would one day push up the concrete sidewalk, impeding residents&#39; ability to walk in and out of the building. Ross later clarified that Farmer had already moved out because the steps on the walkway were too difficult for her to navigate.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">na July legislative meeting,</span> White withdrew the emergency resolution, citing a compromise reached by the chair of the DC council and DDOT to apply a growth regulator to the offending saplings. This outcome infuriates Ross, who is seeking a meeting with Mayor Muriel Bowser: “At the end of the day we voted for her, we didn&#39;t vote for [DDOT officials], and we had faith in her to do what&#39;s best for the people.”<br><br> Ross still has options. If the worst happens and these trees end up extending over the sidewalk, he can call 311 to request tree pruning. According to the Urban Forestry Department, these requests are resolved, on average, within 20 days.<br><br> But the more I talked with Ross and his allies, the more I realized that the trees were also stand-ins for their broader unhappiness with DDOT, which they see as not acting <em>for</em> them but doing things <em>to</em> them: bike racks “just dropped” in front of some businesses, bike lanes constructed over their objections, and traffic-safety infrastructure— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/a2f1cca5159e4c6eae197895d2e08336">in DC&#39;s highest traffic-fatality ward</a> —installed without their consent. This is why Ross was able to enlist supporters in the first place—by tapping into existing anger some residents feel toward the city&#39;s transportation agency. Anger that, in a ward of nearly 90,000 people, a few individuals do not have the final say.<br><br> This is a classic story of local government and its discontents. Government takes action. Angry, well-connected local fights back, annoyed that they weren&#39;t consulted. But when they fight back, claiming the will of the “people,” how do we know if they&#39;re right? Backing up a bit: How do we even decide who the people <em>are</em> ?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/07/local-government-power-nimby-denver/674164/">From the July/August 2023 issue: Colorado&#39;s ingenious idea for solving the housing crisis</a><br><br> In the Xenia Street episode, is it the people who live right next to the trees? How about one street over? Just property owners like Ross? Because the trees are on public land, should all DC residents have a say? Is it all Americans? Addressing the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/07/25/biden-harris-administration-announces-plans-reforestation-climate#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20July%2025%2C%202022%20%E2%80%94,trees%20over%20the%20next%20decade.">reforestation backlog is a national priority</a> . Or, given that trees help mitigate climate change, should <em>all</em> people have a voice? This is the so-called boundary problem, which the political scientist Robert Dahl once quipped has “no theoretical solution,” only pragmatic ones. Even if surveying all of humanity were theoretically desirable, it&#39;s a practical impossibility. One has to draw the line somewhere and delegate representatives or spokespersons.<br><br> Arguably the best delegates in this matter are local elected officials, who get their authority from voters. The problem is that, at the local and especially hyperlocal levels, nobody&#39;s voting. In 2018, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/08/17/two-thirds-of-d-c-neighborhood-races-uncontested/">two-thirds of Advisory Neighborhood Commission races were uncontested</a> . Even when these contests are competitive, only a handful of people show up to cast a ballot. In the single-member district that includes Xenia Street, Armstead, one of Ross&#39;s allies, lost her election <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://electionresults.dcboe.org/election_results/2022-General-Election">137–91</a> . Last year, two ANC races were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dcist.com/story/22/12/01/two-dc-races-to-be-decided-by-casting-of-lots/">tied following Election Day</a> ; in one of them each candidate had garnered 12 votes apiece, while in the other each candidate had claimed just one (presumably their own). Vox populi indeed.<br><br> If the ANC can&#39;t quite speak for the people, what about the DC council, and specifically Council Member White? Council voting rates are also dismal: About 8,700 people total voted in the 2020 primary contest that secured White&#39;s reelection, out of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=B29001:+CITIZEN,+VOTING-AGE+POPULATION+BY+AGE&amp;g=040XX00US11%246100000_1400000US11001000101&amp;tid=ACSDT5Y2021.B29001">roughly 57,000 citizens of voting age in Ward 8</a> .<br><br> How about DDOT? As an agency housed in the executive branch, DDOT gains its authority from the mayor. In 2022, Mayor Bowser received fewer than 4,000 votes from Ward 8 during the primary (the true election in this heavily Democratic city). Only about 10,000 people in the ward voted at all in that contest.<br><br> There&#39;s no magical threshold at which elected officials become democratically legitimate. But more than half of eligible voters <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/2022-voting-registration.html#:~:text=Turnout%20rates%20for%20the%20citizen,%25)%20citizen%20voting%2Dage%20population.">routinely show up</a> for federal and state contests while our municipal elections <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.whovotesformayor.org/">struggle to top 15 percent</a> . What we&#39;re seeing in local governments is a crisis of democracy unparalleled at other levels of government.<br><br> “I <span class="smallcaps">t&#39;s not the trees;</span> it&#39;s the disrespect,” Armstead told me. She called tree removal a top priority because “when you come to a community and you don&#39;t listen, then [we&#39;re] being disrespected and disregarded.” Ross made a similar point: “It makes me angry because, like I said, we&#39;re the stakeholders. We&#39;re the taxpayers. We fund the salaries for the DC government employees, council … This is our money!”<br><br> When we collectively feel entitled to hold the government accountable, that&#39;s democracy. But when individuals do, that&#39;s something else: institutional capture.<br><br> Because so few people vote in local elections, the power of those who speak up and claim to speak for their neighborhoods is hard to challenge. If a homeowner&#39;s association headed by the neighborhood busybody says he speaks for you, are you showing up to contest that claim? What&#39;s obvious about Ross&#39;s perseverance is that its effectiveness is largely due to its singularity. If <em>everyone</em> engaged as he did—called and emailed and attended meeting after meeting, filed complaints with everyone from the office of the inspector general on down—his power would dilute instantly. No one can claim to speak for a community if everyone&#39;s speaking for themselves.<br><br> Democracy is about feedback loops. We elect people. If they do poorly, we choose alternatives. But when the election system falters from disuse, other feedback loops take root. Elected officials at the local level become accountable to the unrepresentative handful of voters who do engage; and public servants become preemptively sensitive to well-connected people who have the time and energy to demand disproportionate focus.<br><br> People like Ross may not get everything they want, but they know how to command attention. No fewer than four DC council members have become personally involved in the matter of the trees on Xenia Street. Meanwhile, that massive hole in the ground? It&#39;s still there.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 08 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trees-xenia-street-washington-dc-local-government/674949/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trees-xenia-street-washington-dc-local-government/674949/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Mike Pence’s 11th Commandment]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Thou may speak ill of Trump, but carefully. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/cTTxI1FB31U4Xhlmi-d3uh0WYyc=/0x0:5693x3202/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/GettyImages_1552040644/original.jpg" alt="迈克·彭斯在舞台上" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Anna Moneymaker / Getty</figcaption></figure> <small><i>This is an edition of</i> The Atlantic <i>Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture.</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a></small><br><br> Ronald Reagan&#39;s 11th commandment was: “Thou shalt not speak ill of any fellow Republican.” This weekend, Mike Pence—like most of the GOP field—struggled mightily to criticize Donald Trump while barely mentioning Trump&#39;s name.<br><br> First, here are three new stories from <i>The Atlantic</i> :<br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/black-folk-book-working-class-blair-lm-kelley/674935/">Ibram X.

Not only did he do his constitutional duty on January 6, 2021, thereby averting the collapse of the US government and the bloodshed that likely would have followed, but lately he seems to be exerting visible caloric effort to criticize the man he served as vice president. And yet, like so many other leading Republicans, Pence seems to be under a kind of necromancer&#39;s curse in which he risks being struck dumb when trying to say Donald Trump&#39;s name.<br><br> Yesterday, the CBS correspondent Major Garrett <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-face-the-nation-aug-6-2023-transcript/">asked Pence</a> whether he&#39;d still vote for Trump. It was an opportunity to knock a softball out of the park. Instead, he flailed.<br><br><p> <b>Major Garrett:</b> Would you ever vote again for Donald Trump?</p><p> <b>Mike Pence:</b> Look, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll have to. I have to tell you, everywhere I go—</p><p> <b>Garrett:</b> That wasn&#39;t the question, Mr. Vice President. Would you ever vote for Donald Trump again?</p><p> <b>Pence:</b> Yeah. Yeah, I know what your question is, but let me be very clear: I&#39;m running for president because I don&#39;t think anyone who ever puts himself over the Constitution should ever be president or should ever be president again.</p> Well, that&#39;s one way to go. Another would be to say, “I know from personal experience that Donald Trump is the most dangerous man ever to sit in the Oval Office, and I will do everything I can to stop him.” To his (again, very small) credit, Pence did open the interview by using Trump&#39;s name long enough to say that he was “wrong” on January 6. Trump, Pence said, “asked me to put him over the Constitution that day, but I chose the Constitution and I always will.” When asked if he would testify against Trump, Pence again whimpered: “I have no plans to testify, but people can be confident we&#39;ll—we&#39;ll obey the law. We&#39;ll respond to the call of the law, if it comes, and we&#39;ll just tell the truth.”<br><br> This is not exactly breathtaking defiance. Nor should we be overly impressed by an American politician affirming that he would honor an oath to the Constitution he&#39;s repeatedly taken in the past. But in these strange times, we take what we can get. Still, Pence was clearly uncomfortable with the question and did everything he could to leave Trump&#39;s name out of the discussion, which is an odd thing to do when you&#39;re heading a campaign against your own former running mate.<br><br> Likewise, consider Ron DeSantis&#39;s grudging acceptance that Trump lost the 2020 election. “Of course he lost,” DeSantis said in an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/video/-of-course-he-lost-ron-desantis-rejects-trump-s-2020-election-claims-190139973789">interview</a> with NBC News today. “乔·拜登是总统。” And Trump&#39;s lies about the election? “Unsubstantiated,” the Florida governor <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/04/us/politics/desantis-trump-election-2020.html">said on Friday</a> . DeSantis has been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ron-desantis-of-course-trump-lost-2020-election-rcna98200">insistent</a> that the 2024 election should be about Joe Biden, but he seems unwilling to deal with the reality that taking on Biden requires defeating Trump first. A <i>New York Times</i> report<i> </i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/07/us/politics/desantis-trump-2020-election.html">referred</a> to the NBC comments as “Mr. DeSantis&#39;s increasingly aggressive stance,” which I suppose is true if you think of the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/07/19/desantis-jan-6-trump/">move from “nothing” to “something”</a> as “increasingly aggressive.”<br><br> Why are Republicans so scared to mention Trump, even at this late date? There are three reasons, two of them grounded in sheer cowardice and the third derived from a hallucinatory primary strategy.<br><br> The first and most obvious problem for GOP candidates is that barking back at Trump infuriates the Republican base, many of whom live in districts and states that Republicans care about. Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson are willing to go after Trump because they are both men with thick skin—but also because they have almost no chance of gaining the GOP nomination. George Will <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.yahoo.com/george-republican-party-living-fear-182154354.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAFshqvzmYCDZvo-PSldHCEUCkXZoCz5GQ9F4OUpI7GFYNPMB0Hv2yWkYzZw8liIlhcrnqdXhB55EmYrN8J_o--wzM26iKsfIhVmDy9VloPQqJHz5v7NSirjb-hVeB5QgSshUsswyNWgNhFai3OCiOOPhywR-0IlhUDtVQpFsrLyx">said it first</a> , but it bears repeating: The modern GOP is the first American party that fears its own voters.<br><br> Few candidates want to cross Trump and then endure his vicious attacks, which is understandable but hardly an example of leadership. (Trump has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/05/trump-pence-has-gone-to-the-dark-side-00109960">already blasted</a> “Liddle&#39; [ <i>sic</i> ] Mike Pence” on his social-media platform, Truth Social, accusing him of being an ungrateful loser who has “gone to the Dark Side.”) And although too many Americans are no longer shocked by it, Trump&#39;s attacks create <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/threats-follow-trump-poliical-attacks/2020/10/28/c6dbce02-1792-11eb-82db-60b15c874105_story.html">real problems of security</a> when he zeroes in on his perceived enemies: Look at how much effort New York;华盛顿特区; and, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/07/31/georgia-2020-election-investigation-trump/">apparently, Atlanta</a> have had to undertake just to indict or prepare to indict Trump.<br><br> Even on a less dire level, however, no one running for president—or trying to hold together what&#39;s left of the Republican Party—needs the headache of a brainless brawl with Trump. From DeSantis and Pence on down, the GOP field avoids invoking Trump&#39;s name, treating him (as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/peacefield/61a69df40b037b002073ccd5/fight-like-adults/">I wrote in 2021</a> ) as if he were some sort of ancient god or mystical <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://en.natmus.dk/historical-knowledge/denmark/middle-ages-1000-1536/j-r-r-tolkien/balrog-medieval-monsters/">Balrog</a> who will appear and unleash chaos at the mention of his name.<br><br> Finally, the GOP primary candidates seem to share a vanity-driven belief that each of them could inherit Trump&#39;s voters once Trump is out of the race because of his legal troubles, or when some other act of God takes him off the board. Somewhere, there&#39;s a strategist telling his client that <i>but for Trump</i> ,<i> </i>voters would stampede toward, say, Nikki Haley or Vivek Ramaswamy. This is what the <i>Bulwark</i> writer Tim Miller has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thetriad.thebulwark.com/p/ron-desantiss-prisoners-dilemma">called</a> “a fantasy primary,” the one being held inside the heads of “Republican elites who secretly loathe Trump and are hoping that voters will soon come to their senses” and pick someone else.<br><br> Now, it&#39;s true that if Trump were physically incapacitated—and I do not wish any ill health on the former president—then, yes, Republicans would have to find someone else. Short of that, however, Trump is clearly going to run even if he is incarcerated. (No <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/05/can-trump-run-for-president-from-prison.html">law or constitutional rule</a> prevents such an attempt.) He will continue to attack American institutions, and he will go on making barely veiled threats of violence, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2023/03/23/indictment-looms-trump-criticizes-calls-peace/">as he has done repeatedly</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/trumps-threatening-post-flagged-by-us-prosecutors-judge-2023-08-05/">even while under indictment</a> .<br><br> Meanwhile, other Republicans are unable to say Trump&#39;s name, press the case against him as unfit for office, or make any of his alleged criminal activity relevant to GOP voters. Back in March, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/03/mike-pence-trump-january-6/673402/">I wrote</a> that Pence “had his one moment of courage, and there will be no others.” Unfortunately, I was right. At this point, other Republicans will head into 2024 unable to mimic even Pence&#39;s sole day of decency.<br><br> <b>Related:</b><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/03/mike-pence-trump-january-6/673402/">Mike Pence is warning us about Trump.</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/trump-2024-election-lead-lincoln-dinner/674877/">Trump&#39;s inevitability problem</a></li> <strong>Today&#39;s News</strong><br><br><li> Tou Thao, a former police officer convicted for his role in the killing of George Floyd, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/george-floyd-minneapolis-officer-tou-thou-sentencing-586deaeb4d14807ef3f2bdd0196d0b86">was sentenced</a> to almost five years in prison by a state court.</li><li> Ukraine claims that it <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/zelenskyy-assassination-plot-ukraine-detains-russia-informant-rcna98507">has detained</a> a Russian informant who it says was part of an apparent plot to assassinate President Volodymyr Zelensky via air strike.</li><li> City officials in Juneau, Alaska, <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/07/record-glacial-flooding-juneau-alaska-emergency-declaration">declared an emergency</a> yesterday because of record glacial lake flooding that destroyed at least two buildings.</li> <b>Evening Read</b><br><br> The Weaponization of Loneliness<br><br> <em>By Hillary Rodham Clinton</em><br><br><p> The question that preoccupied me and many others over much of the past eight years is how our democracy became so susceptible to a would-be strongman and demagogue. The question that keeps me up at night now—with increasing urgency as 2024 approaches—is whether we have done enough to rebuild our defenses or whether our democracy is still highly vulnerable to attack and subversion.</p><p> There&#39;s reason for concern: the influence of dark money and corporate power, right-wing propaganda and misinformation, malign foreign interference in our elections, and the vociferous backlash against social progress. The “vast right-wing conspiracy” has been of compelling interest to me for many years. But I&#39;ve long thought something important was missing from our national conversation about threats to our democracy. Now recent findings from a perhaps unexpected source—America&#39;s top doctor—offer a new perspective on our problems and valuable insights into how we can begin healing our ailing nation.</p> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/hillary-clinton-essay-loneliness-epidemic/674921/">阅读全文。</a><br><br> <b>More From <em>The Atlantic</em></b><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/freedom-to-read-pen-america-censorship/674936/">The three attacks on intellectual freedom</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/ai-chatgpt-college-essay-plagiarism/674928/">Here comes the second year of AI college.</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/viktor-orban-illiberalism-ron-desantis-universities/674915/">Why the populist right hates universities</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/electric-vehicle-energy-infrastructure-heat-waves/674940/">Texas is a look into the future of driving.</a></li> <strong>Culture Break</strong><br><br> <b>Read.</b> In an age of distraction, here are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/attention-focus-book-recommendations/674941/">seven books</a> that will make you put down your phone.<br><br> <b>Watch.</b><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Im-A-Virgo-Season-1/dp/B0B8PXXV2M"><i>I&#39;m a Virgo</i></a><i> </i>(streaming on Amazon Prime Video) is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/08/boots-riley-virgo-show-recommendation/674933/">a sweet, surrealist coming-of-age series</a> that follows a 13-foot-tall Black man who is kept hidden by his family until he finally escapes.<br><br><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/free-daily-crossword-puzzle/">Play our daily crossword.</a><br><br><b>聚苯乙烯</b><br><br>When you work for a magazine, people send you stuff, such as announcements of presidential campaigns. This is how I know that Steve Laffey is running for president.<br><br> I note with local pride that Laffey is the former mayor of Cranston, Rhode Island, a city not too far away from where I live in the Ocean State. (I have never met him; it&#39;s not <i>that</i> small a state.) He served one term as mayor, ran for the US Senate in 2006, and lost. He almost ran for Rhode Island governor in 2010; instead he moved to Colorado, got into the governor&#39;s race there in 2013, pulled out of that one, and then tried to get the GOP nomination in Colorado&#39;s Fourth Congressional District in 2014 (and lost).<br><br> I wasn&#39;t paying much attention to local politics back then, so I can&#39;t really judge whether Laffey was any good as a mayor. But he seemed a throwback to the old fiscally conservative and socially moderate tradition of New England Republicans, a breed now all but extinct in the GOP. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/meet-steve-laffey-longest-long-shot-candidates/story?id=101554970">According</a> to ABC News, Laffey has almost no money and subatomic poll numbers—he has not yet placed on a national poll—and so he will be unlikely to qualify for the GOP debates.

(“IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I&#39;M COMING AFTER YOU!&quot; the message said; a Trump spokesperson claimed that this was actually directed at “the RINO, China-loving, dishonest special interest groups and Super PACs.”) The difference between Trump&#39;s broadsides against Chutkan, a Black Obama appointee who hasn&#39;t even had a chance to make any consequential decisions in the case yet, and his lack of criticism for Judge Aileen Cannon, the Trump appointee overseeing the Florida case over his mishandling of classified documents, is notable if not surprising.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trump-indictment-gop-jan-6/674895/">罗纳德·布朗斯坦：特朗普对民主的威胁现在是系统性的</a><br><br>辨别特朗普的煽动行为很容易。确定他爆发的目标并不那么简单。 One interpretation is that he&#39;s trying to goad Smith&#39;s team and turn its members from prosecutors into persecutors, baiting them to overreact or demand onerous conditions, which Trump could in turn use to demand a venue change or appeal a conviction.但这让人想起<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/profit"><em>《南方公园》</em>中的内裤侏儒模因</a>：第一步和期望的结果很清楚，但中间的步骤可能是什么却完全神秘。尽管特朗普称史密斯“精神错乱”，但这位特别检察官却显得异常、甚至不可思议地冷漠。与其他特区法官一样，Chutkan 驳回了之前关于 1 月 6 日审判无法在该地区公平进行的说法。<br><br>另一种理论认为，特朗普只是在迎合公众舆论，而不是法院。昨天，特朗普的律师约翰·劳罗(John Lauro)在周日节目中巡回演出，这一策略被环城公路的书呆子们称为“完整的金斯伯格”(Full Ginsburg)，以莫妮卡·莱温斯基(Monica Lewinsky)的律师威廉·金斯伯格(William Ginsburg)的名字命名，后者率先回应有关他的客户与时任总统比尔关系的报道。克林顿.这是一种强大的公共关系工具——例如<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Ginsburg">总统候选人使用的工具</a>——但作为审前策略却有些令人困惑。<br><br>特朗普通常更感兴趣的是唤醒他的支持者，而不是寻求谨慎的辩护，显然他的结论是，无论他在法律上遇到什么问题，他的政治影响力都足以逃避或至少巧妙地应对危险。在针对他的两起联邦案件中，他可能最终面临不那么容易规避的指控，但他的反应不一定跟上。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/jeffrey-clark-doj-weaponization-trump-indictment/674898/">大卫·A·格雷厄姆：司法部的真正武器化</a><br><br>在某种程度上，公关攻势可能正在发挥作用。根据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-indictment-jan-6-opinion-poll-2023-08-06/">哥伦比亚广播公司新闻/YouGov 的一项新民意调查</a>，超过一半的美国人认为对特朗普的指控旨在损害他的 2024 年竞选活动，尽管绝大多数人也认为这些指控是为了维护法治和捍卫民主。 But the actual arguments Lauro offered on TV don&#39;t seem especially well crafted, and seem likely instead to reinforce the reality that whether the public wants him convicted or not, it is appalled by Trump&#39;s attempt at stealing the election.<br><br>劳罗在不同场合辩称，特朗普所谓的行为是“有抱负的”。例如，“特朗普总统没有做的是指示副总统彭斯做任何事情，”劳罗在美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 上说道。 “他以一种渴望的方式问他。”他还称特朗普要求佐治亚州国务卿布拉德·拉芬斯佩格“找到 11,780 票”是一个“雄心勃勃的要求”。这种毫无区别的区分给律法主义带来了坏名声。劳罗还表示，即使特朗普“技术上违反了宪法”，他也没有犯罪。但告诉公众你的客户违反了宪法似乎是一个值得怀疑的公关决定。<br><br>无论是劳罗在五次露面，还是特朗普，回到他最初对起诉书的回应，都没有真正反驳这些指控。 Trump has claimed that the government is attacking his right to free speech, but he has made nearly no effort to question the specifics of the charges.一个罕见的例子是他否认彭斯关于特朗普说他“太诚实”的说法。更广泛地说，特朗普没有对他长达数周的颠覆选举的努力提供任何更大的解释。如果特朗普表现得好像他被逼入绝境，那是因为他对这个问题没有一个好的答案。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 19:37:08 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Texas Is a Look Into the Future of Driving]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Mindless energy consumption can no longer be the status quo. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OZkBeEXMXgMU_90DVBnsEUdwp9I=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/cars_tx/original.jpg" alt="德克萨斯州高速公路上的汽车照片" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Alyssa Schukar / Redux</figcaption></figure> Every Texan I know has what you might call “grid anxiety,” a low-humming preoccupation with electricity that emerged after brutal winter storms kneecapped the state&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/connecting-past-and-future-history-texas-isolated-power-grid">isolated power grid</a> in February 2021. That frigid disaster triggered highway pileups and runs on grocery stores; people inadvertently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/live-updates-winter-storms-2021/2021/02/18/969050038/a-disaster-within-a-disaster-carbon-monoxide-poisoning-cases-are-surging-in-texa">poisoned themselves</a> with carbon monoxide by running grills and cars indoors to keep warm. My hometown of San Antonio, like so many places across the state, simply wasn&#39;t equipped to deal with several days of freezing temperatures. Many factors contribute to a disaster of this magnitude, but the fundamental failure of the state&#39;s energy infrastructure can&#39;t be overemphasized.<br><br> Extreme cold is one end of the spectrum. Texas reached the other this summer, as record-breaking <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/south-extreme-heat-wave-texas-climate-change/674598/">heat enveloped the South</a> . Now my conversations with folks back home inevitably lead me to ask, “Is your grid up for this?” So far, the answer has been yes, thanks in part to a substantial expansion of renewable energy, particularly solar power, in the state. But energy is not straightforward: Additional solar capacity will get us only so far if heat waves happen more frequently, and it can be undercut by unfavorable weather or high temperatures that stretch into the night. Experts <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/solar-power-bails-out-texas-grid-during-major-heat-wave/">have said</a> that Texas&#39;s grid is not prepared for the extreme shifts in climate that are still to come. Add to this another complicating factor: Texans need to drive, and more of them are starting to do so in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/texas-electric-vehicle-trends-stats">electric vehicles</a> , which interact with the grid in complex ways. Texas is now the third-largest EV market in the country; registrations have at least doubled since the year of that winter storm to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kxan.com/news/texas/texas-surpasses-200k-electric-vehicle-registrations-statewide/#:~:text=Last%20month%2C%20Gov.,most%20passenger%20vehicles%20and%20trucks.">more than 200,000 today</a> —all of them running on an electrical infrastructure that was never designed to power cars. It&#39;s understandable, then, for Texans to ask if the grid is up for <em>that</em> too.<br><br> Even as EVs promise a better climate, many people <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kvue.com/article/news/investigations/defenders/electric-vehicles-texas-power-grid/269-e54f61e6-54dc-40a5-960a-776390736251">assume that these cars will just suck up energy until there&#39;s nothing left</a> , like giant appliances running all day long, causing power plants to work overtime to compensate. And once their batteries are charged, they can struggle under extreme temperatures. Scott Case, the CEO and co-founder of Recurrent, a start-up that delivers reports on battery health for EV buyers, notes that EVs can lose about 30 percent of their range when temperatures go over 100 degrees. “There&#39;s no battery technology that&#39;s going to change physics,” he told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/tesla-charging-stations-ford-gm-nacs/674423/">Read: Tesla&#39;s magic has been reduced to its chargers</a><br><br> With this in mind, Texas is something of a bellwether for a future that many more of us will soon live in as our reliance on electric cars grows, all while temperatures skyrocket permanently upward. You can imagine the nightmare scenario: EVs become a drain on electric grids as the heat gets worse, contributing to widespread blackouts, and then their depleted batteries turn the cars into bricks on wheels. Such a dramatic future may not come to pass, but we will not be able to maintain the status quo: A more extreme climate, combined with the relative complexity of EVs, will require drivers to change their relationship to energy consumption in general, and car manufacturers to reconsider what they build and how.<br><br> The Texas-based electricity giant Vistra is optimistic about what&#39;s next. Emily Stipe, the company&#39;s senior manager for federal and state advocacy, is one of several energy officials seeking to assuage EV-related infrastructure fears as heat becomes more extreme. “We really do believe that the grid will be able to handle the deployment of electric vehicles,” Stipe said during a recent presentation by the nonprofit Zero Emission Transportation Association, or ZETA. But that only happens if multiple parties work together, including “not only the actual EV industry itself, but its supply chain, the electricity providers, and the consumers.”<br><br> Most evidence indicates that EVs won&#39;t put as much strain on grids as people might think. ZETA estimates that in 2021, EVs used just 0.15 percent of total national energy generation. The growth in available energy is far outpacing new demand from EVs, the group says. Even as sales in Texas are steadily growing, “at this time, the loads from EVs are not significant enough to have an impact on the grid,” a spokesperson for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which operates 90 percent of the state&#39;s electricity network, told me. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/28/texas-heatwave-power-grid-solar-energy">reported doubling</a> of solar power since 2022 has also helped the state&#39;s aging power plants keep the lights on—this despite <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.texastribune.org/2023/05/25/texas-energy-renewables-natural-gas-grid-politics/">considerable opposition to renewables</a> in a place where oil and gas reign supreme. (A greener grid also helps EVs reach their maximum potential for reducing transportation emissions.)<br><br> EVs can also provide benefits many people don&#39;t realize yet. Cars from Ford, Hyundai, Volkswagen, and others are being designed to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://virta.global/vehicle-to-grid-v2g?__hstc=51530422.6ad426d1409f1436c8073dc60c9478b9.1690253826668.1690253826668.1690253826668.1&amp;__hssc=51530422.12.1690253826668&amp;__hsfp=2924083047&amp;hsutk=6ad426d1409f1436c8073dc60c9478b9&amp;contentType=standard-page&amp;pageId=19739738079#three">return energy to the grid</a> , a technology called bidirectional charging. Whereas the potential energy stored in a gasoline vehicle&#39;s tank can be used only one way, these EVs can help power homes or sell electricity back into the grid. “When you look at what grid resilience is, it&#39;s really the ability for the grid to prepare for and adapt to changing operating conditions,” Chanel Parson, the director of electrification at Southern California Edison, told me. Because EVs only actually drive 5 to 10 percent of the day, she said, “that leaves 21 to 23 hours of a day when a vehicle can discharge its battery to a home or even the grid.”<br><br> This does require “smart grid” upgrades that many utilities are working on right now—all sorts of things, including new transformers, extended power lines, and even better <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.smart-energy.com/digitalisation/cybersecurity/does-v2g-pose-a-cyber-threat-to-the-grid/">cybersecurity</a> . But there&#39;s tremendous potential for battery storage to help on days when solar and wind are weaker; California even staved off blackouts during a crushing heat wave last September thanks to giant batteries connected to the grid, Stipe told me. Often, these are repurposed former EV batteries. “We have seen firsthand the many benefits that energy storage provides, even just beyond emissions-reduction benefits,” she said.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/05/where-are-the-ev-charging-stations/674241/">Read: The one thing holding back electric vehicles in America</a><br><br> Even now, most EVs come with options for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/managed-electric-vehicle-charging.html">smart charging</a> : the ability to manage charging times and levels via the car&#39;s software or the charger&#39;s app. Like a smart thermostat, this allows EV owners to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8oASdb_CjQ">schedule and manage charging for off-peak hours</a> . In other words, you can plug in your EV after you get home from work in the evening but schedule it to charge overnight, when grids aren&#39;t already overworked from heat and the whole family running electricity in the house. This can be done at public chargers too.<br><br> The current world leader in EVs has long played this game. Tesla offers solar tiles and home-energy-storage solutions such as its Powerwall. Now many “traditional” car companies are developing competing products. GM Energy, a new division of General Motors, is rolling out what it calls an “electric ecosystem” for homes and businesses, including solar power, charging, backup batteries, and bidirectional charging technology. “If you&#39;re able to manage the energy, inflow, and outflow, which you could do as a consumer with all of these kinds of pieces, then you have an opportunity to be able to help mitigate some of the issues that come with inclement weather,” Darryll Harrison Jr., a GM spokesperson, told me. These features are expected to roll out with the retail launch of the new Chevrolet Silverado EV, which will begin production later this year.<br><br> The permanent-heat-wave era will change how EVs are built as well. Many automakers are coping with vehicles&#39; range reduction from extreme temperatures by adding new hardware features, such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.moveelectric.com/e-cars/what-heat-pump-and-how-do-they-benefit-electric-cars">heat pumps</a> . Although these are generally seen primarily as a winter-range benefit, their ability to release warm air can greatly improve range in the summer too, Case said. The use of heat pumps, like so many other realities of owning an EV—including monitoring energy usage and figuring out the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/electric-vehicle-rental-cars-hertz-chargers/674429/">best way to charge</a> —will require behavioral changes for drivers who have spent decades just paying for gas and driving away, he said: “Everybody grew up learning how to take care of a combustion-engine car from their parents or their grandparents.” In the nascent EV era, “everyone now is coming up with new rules.”<br><br> Maybe a bigger challenge will be to get drivers, homeowners, and even renters to start thinking differently about their energy use, period. Mindlessly consuming fuel or electricity isn&#39;t a luxury we have anymore. “For many people, they just want their lights to come on when they flick the switch, and they don&#39;t want to think about their electric plan anytime other than their renewal period every year,” Stipe said. “We really need to change that.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 13:25:07 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/electric-vehicle-energy-infrastructure-heat-waves/674940/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/electric-vehicle-energy-infrastructure-heat-waves/674940/</item></channel></rss>
