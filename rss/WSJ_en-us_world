That could worsen inflation at a time when output cuts by Saudi Arabia and export restrictions by Russia have already tightened global oil supplies and boosted Brent by 12% over the past month. Across two main terminals, Novorossiysk is capable of exporting about 2.5% of the 100 million barrels of oil that the world consumes daily.</p><p> The biggest portion of the oil shipped from the port comes from Kazakhstan and is produced by companies including Chevron and Exxon Mobil. About 1.5 million barrels of Kazakh crude depart each day, according to data from S&amp;P Global Commodities at Sea. Most of it leaves from a distinct terminal fed by the CPC pipeline, which is owned by a consortium including the two US oil-and-gas giants and runs from fields near the Caspian Sea to Novorossiysk.</p><p> “It&#39;s more of a scare than an impact,” said Viktor Katona, senior crude analyst at ship-tracking firm Kpler, of the Ukrainian strike. “But that scare is quite significant, because if something happens to CPC: Boy, we&#39;re in trouble.”</p><p> Most of the Russian crude and products exported from Novorossiysk now travel to Asian refiners, after the European Union and the UK <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-defies-sanctions-by-selling-oil-above-price-cap-bae1c271?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">banned most petroleum imports from Russia</a> starting last December.

The assaults on Ukrainian ports and grain infrastructure are part of a broader Russian attack on Ukraine&#39;s economy, said James O&#39;Brien, the head of the State Department&#39;s sanctions division.</p><p> “We&#39;re witnessing Russia attacking the global food security system,” he told reporters in an online briefing.</p><p> The escalating hostilities in the Black Sea are likely to pile economic pressure on Russia&#39;s most influential international partners, including China, which was the largest buyer of grain under the export agreement. Russia&#39;s withdrawal from the deal and subsequent attacks on Ukrainian ports have also strained relations with Turkey&#39;s president, who helped broker the agreement in the first place.</p><p> Russia struck a Ukrainian port on the Danube River early on Wednesday, targeting another route that Ukraine uses to export grain, while Moscow and Kyiv have traded threats to attack ships headed to each other&#39;s ports in recent weeks. The Russian Defense Ministry said it averted an attack on ships near the port of Sevastopol in Crimea earlier this week.</p><p> By imposing a blockade on Ukraine&#39;s ports and stepping up its own Black Sea exports of grain, oil and other commodities, Russia has effectively seized control of a larger share of the vital trade routes in the waterway. Novorossiysk accounts for 17% of Russia&#39;s maritime trade.</p><p> Russia also uses the port for transporting weapons using commercial cargo ships, the Journal previously reported. A US-sanctioned Russian cargo ship, Sparta IV, was pictured in the port carrying artillery weapons in satellite imagery in July.</p><p class="articleTagLine"> —Joe Wallace contributed to this article.</p><p> Write to Thomas Grove at <a href="mailto:thomas.grove@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">thomas.grove@wsj.com</a> and Jared Malsin at <a href="mailto:jared.malsin@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">jared.malsin@wsj.com</a></p></section></div></main></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 18:26:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-naval-drones-attack- Russian-black-sea-port-81b4f2e6</guid><link/> https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukrainian-naval-drones-attack- Russian-black-sea-port-81b4f2e6<author><![CDATA[Thomas GroveAnastasiia MalenkoJared Malsin]]></author><category> gfx-contrib</category><category>乌克兰</category><category>Energy</category><category> Military Watercraft</category><category>港口/港口运营</category><category>航空航天/国防</category><category>Defense Equipment/Products</category><category>工业品</category><category>水路运输/航运</category><category>运输/物流</category><category>容量/设施</category><category>企业/行业新闻</category><category>政治/一般新闻</category><category>国家/公共安全</category><category>武装部队</category><category>Navy</category><category>风险新闻</category><category>军事行动</category><category>商品市场</category><category>能源市场</category><category>商品/金融市场新闻</category><category>内容类型</category><category>法激活过滤器</category><category>C&amp;E 排除过滤器</category><category>Ukraine</category><category> SYND</category><category>华尔街日报-PRO-WSJ.com</category><category>容量</category><category>设施</category><category>公司的</category><category>行业新闻</category><category>政治的</category><category>一般新闻</category><category>国家的</category><category>公安</category><category>武装部队</category><category>海军</category><category>风险新闻</category><category>军事行动</category><category>商品市场</category><category>能源市场</category><category>商品</category><category>金融市场新闻</category><category>内容类型</category><category>法蒂瓦过滤器</category><category>c&amp;e 排除过滤器</category><category>活力</category><category>military watercraft</category><category>港口</category><category>港口作业</category><category>航天</category><category>防御</category><category>defense equipment</category><category>产品</category><category>工业品</category><category>水运</category><category>船运</category><category>运输</category><category>后勤</category></item><item><title><![CDATA[How the U.S. Fumbled Niger’s Coup and Gave Russia an Opening]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A week of missteps and communication breakdowns pushed an important American ally toward the Kremlin <figure><img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-829433/?width=1278&amp;size=1" alt="Demonstrators in Niger’s capital, Niamey, show their support for the coup on Thursday." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Demonstrators in Niger&#39;s capital, Niamey, show their support for the coup on Thursday.

To anxious French and American allies, he repeated assurances that the army would soon rescue him from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/niger-coup-embassy-evacuation-africa-33d18bc?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">an unfolding coup</a> .</p><p> Outside the ground floor safe room Mohamed Bazoum had recently renovated to protect himself from such an event, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/niger-general-declares-himself-leader-as-russian-mercenary-hails-coup-d47efa68?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">mutineers from his presidential guard</a> fanned out across the presidency compound, furious about a proposal to replace their longstanding commander, according to Nigerien, US and European officials. Hunkered over the phone beside his wife and son, Bazoum delicately encouraged advisers to send the army&#39;s regular units.</p><p> At around noon, his cellphone rang with a call from a former US ambassador, who was about to board a flight on his vacation. The ambassador was worried one of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/niger-coup-upends-u-s-security-plans-in-west-africa-handing-russia-an-opportunity-8dcf6679?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Washington&#39;s closest allies in Africa</a> could become the latest in a string of regional states to fall into the hands of coup leaders sympathetic to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/france-prepares-to-evacuate-european-citizens-from-coup-hit-niger-d46774af?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Russia</a> .</p><p> Everything is fine, the imprisoned president carefully intoned.</p><p> A week later, Bazoum is still imprisoned in his palace, junta leaders are seeking aid from <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> &#39;s regional partners and America is on the verge of losing its most important ally in a crucial and unstable part of Africa. An obscure personnel dispute within Niger&#39;s presidential guard has now become what appears to be a geopolitical win for Russia and its Wagner Group paramilitary company in their bid to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-need-of-allies-putin-courts-african-leaders-in-st-petersburg-b6596a7b?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">flip Western allies</a> .</p><p> The situation could yet turn into open military conflict. Eleven West African countries, led by Nigeria, have threatened to use force to restore Bazoum to power if the coup isn&#39;t reversed by Sunday. In return, the pro-Russian leaders of Mali and Burkina Faso have vowed to defend Niger. Officials in the US and Europe are scrambling for ways to return Bazoum to power but concede the window is closing.</p><p> The Kremlin on Friday warned against any intervention. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Wagner&#39;s mercenaries have previously taken over former US and French outposts in Syria and Mali.</p><p> This outcome wasn&#39;t predestined. A week of missteps and communication breakdowns pushed the vast nation of Niger toward Russia. Nigerien, American, European and other West African security officials, as well as Nigerien soldiers, described a series of unexpected blunders that now threatens to turn West Africa into a theater for regional war.</p><p> Washington, caught without key personnel in its Africa posts, failed to anticipate what is now the seventh coup in the region since 2020—not including a failed attempt in Niger two years ago. While Bazoum sat in his safe room calling for help, America and its allies struggled to react as the conflict escalated into threats of war between Russian-backed countries and West Africa&#39;s biggest military, Nigeria. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Yet the country&#39;s special forces, trained for nearly every counterterrorism eventuality, had no answer for Sunday&#39;s coup—West Africa&#39;s most enduring security threat. The forces were left chatting over WhatsApp groups over whether to intervene.</p><p> The US and Europe have made Niger the centerpiece of their fight against the spread of Islamic State and al Qaeda in Africa&#39;s Sahel, a 3,000-mile semiarid territory on the southern shore of the Sahara that also includes Burkina Faso, Mali and Chad. They are some of the world&#39;s poorest and fastest-growing populations, in failing states. Nearly half of Niger&#39;s budget comes from foreign aid.</p><p> “This is your strong ally, your reliable ally, you have invested a lot and then there is a coup without any reason,” said Kiari Liman Tinguiri, Niger&#39;s ambassador to Washington, who was fired by the junta overnight. “It&#39;s very nice to be friends of the West, but it may not be helpful when hard times come.”</p><p> US State and White House officials have said they still think there&#39;s a narrow opportunity for a peaceful resolution that would retain Niger&#39;s democracy.</p><p> “While we are giving diplomacy a chance and have ongoing diplomatic engagements at the highest levels, we are continuing to review all options around our cooperation with the Nigerien government,” a spokeswoman for the White House National Security Council said. “Our focus is to help the people of Niger preserve their hard-earned democracy.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

The presidential guard felt marginalized after vast sums of military assistance poured into the country&#39;s counterterrorism units, two people familiar with the situation said.</p><p> The French intelligence service DGSE warned Paris of the risk, but neither France nor the US took significant action to defend their ally in Niamey, according to French and West African intelligence officials.</p><p> Bazoum, elected in 2021 in Niger&#39;s first democratic transfer of power, had been feted in Washington as a reliable partner against the twin threats of jihadist attacks and Russia&#39;s growing influence. </p><div class="media-object scope-

We don&#39;t need them,” he said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal shortly after he was elected.</p><p> Some of Niger&#39;s military leaders saw him as an interloper with an Arab background. Niger&#39;s majority Hausa ethnic group predominates the military.</p><p> In April, Bazoum replaced the army chief of staff and the head of the national gendarmerie, hoping to place more trusted officers in their ranks, according to European and West African security officials. That stirred suspicion within his presidential guard. On July 24, Bazoum directed an aide to draft a decree to dismiss the guard&#39;s leader. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Tchiani&#39;s unit had stopped a coup attempt against Bazoum days ahead of his inauguration. As Bazoum built up the country&#39;s counterterrorism forces, Tchiani&#39;s guard lost out on resources and stature. The president had been weighing for months whether to fire the 57-year-old general, according to people familiar with the matter.</p><p> At 3 am on July 26, the general&#39;s men drove up to the presidential palace, a white stucco arabesque estate overlooking the Niger River. Inside, gazelles and goats slept in the manicured gardens, animals Bazoum and his wife brought with them when he took office.</p><p> Tchiani&#39;s men, carrying heavy weaponry, disarmed security officers equipped only with handguns and walked past the presidential garden to Bazoum&#39;s residence.</p><p> Bazoum fled into the safe room across the hall from his office and phoned aides to say he was confident that US-trained elements of his army would rally to his rescue.</p><p> In a twist, some of the best US-trained special forces among Niger&#39;s regular army units were on counterterrorism missions in the distant desert regions of a country twice the size of Texas, with few roads. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Rank-and-file soldiers said they debated over WhatsApp groups what to do. They received no formal instructions from their commanders, who appeared to be waiting to see which faction had the momentum. Bazoum, who still had full control of his communications in the safe room, phoned international allies and ambassadors in Niger&#39;s embassies in the West. He stressed over phone and video calls that the coup had no basis—it was a personnel dispute and could easily be reversed. His US envoy rushed to let the State Department know what was happening.</p><p> Though the US had spent hundreds of millions of dollars transforming Niger into its top military outpost in the Sahara, it didn&#39;t have an ambassador in the country.</p><p> The Biden administration didn&#39;t formally nominate one until eight months after the previous ambassador left, only to face opposition from Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky.), who has put <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-woke-complaints-hold-up-bidens-ambassador-picks-b95e73e9?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">holds on State Department appointees</a> until the White House releases intelligence he believes could show Covid-19 leaked from a Chinese lab.</p><p> Washington also has no ambassador at the African Union or in neighboring Nigeria—or anybody in a special envoy post that it had created to deal with the region&#39;s deterioration. The relevant Africa desk at the National Security Council was in flux, held by a short-term temporary post that was due to hand off to another temporary caretaker within days.</p><p> “This is extremely frustrating. This was not a widely supported coup—it was one unit that had its grievance for years and we should have done more to act,” said J. Peter Pham, former US special envoy to the Sahel under President Trump. In the early hours, he added, “his exfiltration could have been organized relatively easily…. The golden hour has passed.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

A decision would have to come from President Emmanuel Macron, who was traveling in the South Pacific, 12 time zones ahead. France&#39;s government declined to comment.</p><p> Junta leaders headed to a state TV station and stood around a table where a stone-faced spokesman said the military could no longer “witness the gradual and inevitable demise of our country.”</p><p> If Bazoum was going to be freed, it would have to come from outside.</p><h3> Guns of August</h3><p> Macron had just landed in the South Pacific island of New Caledonia when he spoke to his top defense and diplomatic officials, who laid out options to free Bazoum.</p><p> For years, the French president had been briefed on a growing protest movement against France in the cities of its former West African colonies.</p><p> Young men jam-packed into those cities had come to see France&#39;s military presence as an unwelcome imposition after years of al Qaeda attacks. Viral social-media posts and videos accused the French army of pursuing ulterior aims on Africa&#39;s natural resources.</p><p> In Mali, then Burkina Faso, coup leaders seized power and justified their takeovers as an act of liberation from France, before turning to Russia as their protector and benefactor.</p><p> The French president ruled out sending a unilateral force to usher a democratically elected president to power—as France did in 2011 in Ivory Coast. Instead, he wanted to assist Nigerien armed forces that remained loyal to Bazoum, an option that vanished as the country&#39;s military command acquiesced to the coup.</p><p> US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was in the South Pacific as well, warning the people of the island country of Tonga that China was practicing economic coercion. By the time he and Bazoum connected, the coup was complete.</p><p> Russia was in an excellent position to step into the vacuum.</p><p> Vladimir Putin was already receiving African leaders invited to a Russia-Africa summit in St. Petersburg due to start the following day.</p><p> Bazoum had refused the invitation, but the Kremlin-backed leaders of Mali and Burkina Faso, Assimi Goita and Ibrahim Traore, gathered for meetings in the halls of the Constantine Palace. As news of the coup trickled in, their intelligence chiefs met under Russian auspices to agree on a coordinated response. </p><div class="media-object scope-

But now, we have an opportunity to form new relations.”</p><p> The junta, which included recipients of US training and largess, hadn&#39;t shown particular interest in pivoting toward Russia. The military itself let US counterparts know they wanted to keep the American aid flowing, military officers said. But the Kremlin eyed an opportunity.</p><p> Yevgeny Prigozhin, whose <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/putin-moves-to-seize-control-of-wagners-global-empire-26d49286?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Wagner mercenaries</a> are protecting the leaders of Mali and the Central African Republic, offered to help the putschists in Niger, hailing their overthrow of a pro-American government.</p><p> “What happened in Niger is nothing other than the struggle of the people of Niger with their colonizers,” he said in a voice-mail message posted in a Telegram account.</p><p> Protests, organized by an opposition movement, thronged France&#39;s embassy in Niger. Several in the crowd waved Russian flags. France sent military planes to evacuate its citizens. The US moved its 1,100 troops, sent there to fight Islamist insurgents, inside American-built drone and special-forces bases. The State Department held off on calling the upheaval a coup, a designation that could, under US law, sharply restrict America&#39;s ability to keep funding, training and equipping Niger&#39;s military. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Nigeria was once the world&#39;s 33rd richest country per capita, until decades of military coups and misrule left it among the poorest. Its leaders feared a domino of coups would topple more civilian governments.</p><p> On Sunday, July 30, Nigeria&#39;s new president, Bola Tinubu, gathered with presidents and foreign ministers from 11 West African states, along with a representative from Bazoum&#39;s government, in a glass-paneled building in the Nigerian capital of Abuja. Tinubu, who had risen to prominence campaigning against military rule in Nigeria, said that after coups in Mali and Burkina Faso—both supported by Russia—as well as in Guinea and Chad, the one in Niger was the last straw. If they accepted this coup, more would come.</p><p> After their meeting ended, the West African leaders issued an ultimatum: Tchiani had one week to return power to the democratically elected president or face the possible use of military force.</p><p> The State Department wasn&#39;t sure it backed the idea, senior US officials said. But Washington also wanted to show support for the West African governments. Blinken issued statements of general support for the Nigerian-led idea. A Nigerian government spokesperson declined to comment.</p><p> On Wednesday, Tchiani sent one of his junta leaders on a secret flight to Mali to meet the country&#39;s pro-Russian leader.</p><p> Defense chiefs from the West African states that oppose the coup met in Nigeria. Deputy National Security Advisor Jonathan Finer flew to Abuja to meet Tinubu, Nigeria&#39;s president, who said the coup should not stand.</p><p> The Biden administration favored diplomacy but worried the junta intended to force Nigeria to make good on its threat of military force, concerns that came up in the meeting. Few in Washington felt confident Nigeria&#39;s military had the capacity to pull off an intervention. But at this point, the US conceded, there were few options left. </p><div class="media-object scope-

He described it as a “Stalinist” term, referring to Soviet-era dictator Joseph Stalin&#39;s propensity for imprisoning thousands of people in forced labor for long periods, or simply executing them.</p><p> Navalny asked his supporters to think why prosecutors pushed for such a long term. “It&#39;s main purpose is to intimidate.

"></div><p> Presidential spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters earlier this year that the Kremlin isn&#39;t paying attention to Navalny&#39;s case, and refrains from getting involved in matters of the court. When asked to comment on Navalny, Putin has typically avoided even voicing the critic&#39;s name.</p><p> Before his <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-opposition-leader-alexei-navalny-returns-to-moscow-11610906483?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">arrest at a Moscow airport in 2021</a> , Navalny had developed a large online following for his exposure of corruption, including investigations into Putin&#39;s personal wealth. From prison, he has continued to lampoon government policies, condemn the war in Ukraine and urged Russians to speak out.</p><p> Navalny&#39;s aides say prison authorities have gone out of their way to make his life intolerable by regularly placing him in what is called a punishment cell where prisoners are denied food parcels or the opportunity to buy additional food, leaving them relying solely on food and water supplied by the prison. He has also complained of being forced to share a prison cell with unsanitary inmates who neglect personal hygiene.</p><p> In addition, concern has grown over Navalny&#39;s health, which had already been damaged by what medical experts in Germany, France and Sweden concluded was <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-novichok-poisoning-of-alexei-navalny-some-see-a-kremlin-calling-card-11599157248?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">a poisoning attempt in 2020</a> . His aides say he has lost a lot of weight and has suffered from stomach pain and seizures, leading them to believe that he&#39;s being slowly poisoned in the Melekhovo prison near Moscow.</p><p> Prison authorities didn&#39;t respond to a request for comment on the poisoning claims or that he is being unjustly placed in solitary confinement.</p><p> The additional prison terms, human-rights activists say, are aimed at trying to break him.</p><p> So far, there is little sign of that working. Shown on video in the courtroom on Friday, Navalny appeared relaxed, shaking hands and chatting with his co-defendant Daniel Kholodny, a former technical director of Navalny&#39;s YouTube channel, who is accused of financing extremist activities using his official position and participation in an extremist community. Kholodny received an eight-year sentence, TASS reported.</p><p> In his comments on the X platform, Navalny called on what he says are millions of Russians opposed to corruption, war and lawlessness to stand up for what they believe in.</p><p> “If one in 10 of those outraged by the corruption of Putin and his officials took to the streets, the government would fall tomorrow,” he said, though added that this was wishful thinking.</p><p> “Someone has to be first, and it&#39;s scary to be first,” he said, adding that there were other ways to show defiance, such as supporting political prisoners, painting graffiti or sharing his group&#39;s investigative reports.</p><p> “There is no shame in choosing the safest way to resist,” he said. “The shame is in doing nothing.”</p><p> In comments posted Friday to the Navalny team&#39;s Instagram account, his supporters sounded a positive tone.</p><p> “ Alexei Navalny will be free, Russia will definitely be happy,” they said. “Under no circumstances let Putin achieve his main goal—with this monstrous sentence—to intimidate millions of supporters of change and a peaceful future. We continue to fight on.”</p><p> Write to Ann M.

A key concern of James Madison and Alexander Hamilton was that demagogues would incite mobs and factions to defy the rule of law, overturn free and fair elections and undermine American democracy. “The only path to a subversion of the republican system of the Country is, by flattering the prejudices of the people, and exciting their jealousies and apprehensions, to throw affairs into confusion, and bring on civil commotion,” Alexander Hamilton wrote in 1790. “When a man unprincipled in private life desperate in his fortune, bold in his temper…is seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity,” Hamilton warned, “he may &#39;ride the storm and direct the whirlwind.&#39;”</p><p> The Founders designed a constitutional system to prevent demagogues from sowing confusion and mob violence in precisely this way. The vast extent of the country, Madison said, would make it hard for local factions to coordinate any kind of mass mobilization. The horizontal separation of powers among the three branches of government would ensure that the House impeached and the Senate convicted corrupt presidents. The vertical division of powers between the states and the federal government would ensure that local officials ensured election integrity.</p><p> And norms about the peaceful transfer of power, strengthened by George Washington&#39;s towering example of voluntarily stepping down from office after two terms, would ensure that no elected president could convert himself, like Caesar, into an unelected dictator. “The idea of introducing a monarchy or aristocracy into this Country,” Hamilton wrote, “is one of those visionary things, that none but madmen could meditate,” as long as the American people resisted “convulsions and disorders in consequence of the acts of popular demagogues.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

The indictment alleges that soon after election day, Trump “pursued unlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results,” perpetuating three separate criminal conspiracies: to impede the collection and counting of the ballots, Congress&#39;s certification of the results on Jan. 6, 2021, and the right to vote itself.</p><p> The indictment alleges that all three conspiracies involved a concerted effort by Trump and his co-conspirators to subvert the election results using “knowingly false claims of election fraud.” In particular, Trump allegedly “organized fraudulent slates of electors in seven targeted states”; tried to use “the power and authority of the Justice Department to conduct sham election crime investigations”; tried to enlist Vice President <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/mike-pence">Mike Pence</a> “to fraudulently alter the election results”; and, as violence broke out on Jan. 6, redoubled his efforts to “convince Members of Congress to further delay the certification.” </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Michael Luttig told me. A respected conservative jurist, Luttig helped to persuade Vice President Pence that he had no power to overturn the election results. “These are the gravest offenses against the United States that an incumbent president could commit,” he said, “save possibly treason.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

Two years before the election, Federalists in Congress passed the Sedition Act, making it illegal to “write, print, utter or publish…any false, scandalous, and malicious writing or writings against the government of the United States.” In practice, this muzzled the Republican opposition by making it a crime to criticize the Federalist president, John Adams.</p><p> The Republican vice president, Thomas Jefferson, responded by arguing that states had the power to nullify federal laws with which they disagreed. In the election that followed, Adams came in third, and Jefferson and his vice president, Aaron Burr, tied with an equal number of electoral votes. Alexander Hamilton, who believed that Jefferson posed less of a threat to the republic than Burr, helped persuade Federalists in Congress, who had to break the tie, to elect Jefferson. Both Adams and Burr accepted the election results and supported the peaceful transfer of power. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

He encouraged state prosecutions of his Federalist critics and lashed out against his archrival, Chief Justice John Marshall.</p> He also supported the impeachment of Justice Samuel Chase, a partisan Federalist who had presided over one of the sedition trials, but the Senate acquitted Chase, establishing a precedent that Congress shouldn&#39;t remove judges from office because of disagreement with their rulings.<p></p><p> Jefferson then indicted Burr, his former vice president, for treason. After killing Hamilton in the famous duel in 1804, Burr had fled west to improve his fortunes and raised an expedition of men to seize lands in Texas and Louisiana belonging to Spain. In 1806, Jefferson received reports that Burr was conspiring to incite the western states to secede from the Union and to conquer new territory. Jefferson alerted Congress and ordered Burr&#39;s arrest. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

He issued a subpoena to Jefferson to deliver documents that Burr said he needed for his defense. Jefferson initially claimed executive privilege but ultimately turned over the letters. Marshall then told the jury that, according to the Constitution, a treason conviction required evidence of overt acts of war committed against the US proved by two witnesses, and that no such evidence existed. The jury swiftly found Burr not guilty. Jefferson reportedly wanted to bring impeachment charges against Marshall for his conduct in the Burr trial but was dissuaded from doing so by the precedent established by the acquittal of Justice Chase.</p><p> Unlike Aaron Burr, Donald Trump has not been indicted for treason. But the trial of Burr, and the legal controversies surrounding the election of 1800, provide lessons about the challenges that will face American institutions before and after the election of 2024. Then, as now, there were grave warning signs of democratic decay, with allegations that both parties were criminalizing their opposition through partisan prosecutions and attacks on free speech, judicial independence and the rule of law.</p><p> Partisan passions ran high in 1800, as they do today, but American institutions and norms survived, thanks to the self-restraint of the leading institutional players and their commitment to preserving the Union. Adams and Burr accepted the election results, Jefferson accepted the Burr verdict, and the Republican Congress declined to impeach Marshall. </p><div class="media-object scope-

The shared norms and constitutional commitments that had prevailed a generation earlier were not strong enough to avert the disaster of war.<p></p><p> The great question today is which of these historical precedents our leaders and the public will follow. Donald Trump faces a range of legal troubles, but the indictment announced this week, even as he dominates the Republican race for the 2024 nomination, is the most far-reaching yet, accusing him of actively undermining foundational elements of our constitutional order.</p><div class="media-object scope-web

Otherwise, the election of 2024 may turn into a tragic rupture of our institutions, more like 1860 than 1800.</p><p> At the end of their lives, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams, who had reconciled in the decade after the explosive election of 1800, were pessimistic about the future of the American experiment. Adams worried that American citizens lacked sufficient civic virtue to sustain the republic, and Jefferson feared that factional clashes over slavery would destroy the Union.</p><p> Among the Founding generation, only James Madison was moderately optimistic that American institutions would survive. He hoped that public opinion could be educated to overcome the most destructive partisan passions. He had faith that, among other things, a class of enlightened “literati” would use the new technologies of the print media to diffuse the cool voice of reason throughout the land. </p><div class="media-object scope-

On social media, with a business model of “enrage to engage,” posts meant to spark our partisan passions travel further and faster than those based on persuasive reason. Democratic transparency and participation have grown in ways that the Founders couldn&#39;t have imagined, extending long-overdue rights and liberties but also levelling the speed bumps they put in place to promote thoughtful deliberation by elites.</p><p> The Founders feared direct democracy and devised a Constitution to tame it, to the frustration of reformers today. They would be astonished by our current political system, with its presidential primary system, nationwide campaigning and ever-more sophisticated media targeting, all of which has given new opportunities to partisan extremists and demagogues.</p><p> The Founders&#39; concerns about how democracies fall were articulated by a young Abraham Lincoln in one of his earliest political speeches. Then serving as a member of the Illinois legislature, he worried about the fate of the republic if a leader of demagogic ambition arose who was not committed to the institutions built by the founding generation. “Distinction,” Lincoln said, “will be his paramount object, and although he would as willingly, perhaps more so, acquire it by doing good as harm; yet, that opportunity being past, and nothing left to be done in the way of building up, he would set boldly to the task of pulling down.”</p><p> J <em>effrey Rosen is president and CEO of the National Constitution Center.

These days, many rookie consultants are just hoping to be on a project—any project.</p><p> For the first time in years, recent hires have too little to do—and that&#39;s stressing them out more than the round-the-clock work they anticipated. Some young consultants “on the bench” or “on the beach”—lingo for being between clients—say they spend downtime exercising, watching Netflix or napping, while still getting paid. Such a scenario might sound too good to be true for many in corporate America. For this cohort of high achievers, who thought they&#39;d pull themselves up the ladder through their work on thorny business challenges, it&#39;s far from ideal. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

It&#39;s the first time in decades big consulting firms have simultaneously undertaken layoffs and delayed starting dates for new hires in an uncertain economic environment, according to Michael Mische, a former KPMG and AT Kearney principal who leads the University of Southern California&#39;s consulting program.</p><p> Asutosh Padhi, McKinsey&#39;s managing partner for North America, said fluctuations in workload—from being too busy to not busy enough—can feel drastic for early-career consultants. Still, firms fear cutting jobs when work is slack because they need to ensure they&#39;ll have senior staff in the future. McKinsey hires with a long-term view, he said.</p><p> “At any point if we stop recruiting and if we stop hiring, we feel the impact for the next six to eight years,” he said.</p><p> Alicia Pittman, a managing director and senior partner at Boston Consulting Group who oversees development and performance reviews in North America, said consultants without a client assignment can learn through projects that improve how their own company works. But it&#39;s understandable that some are stressed.</p><p> “We hire the most hard-charging people, who want to learn, they want to develop,” she said. “They&#39;re always saying, &#39;Am I getting the right experience, am I doing the right things, am I going to learn?&#39; ”</p><p> Young consultants say they worry the slump will cause them to be pushed out or tarnish their performance reviews, derailing them from what is often a fast track to elite corporate or entrepreneurial roles.</p><p> Too many consultants with too much downtime creates problems for the broader campus-to-industry talent pipeline, too. Consulting firms are some of the biggest recruiters at top universities. They hired nearly half of last year&#39;s MBA graduates from Yale University, Dartmouth College and the University of Virginia, with a median salary of $175,000. After several years of grinding, many pollinate the leadership ranks of finance, business and tech with the lessons learned from advising corporate clients. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Many junior ones could get pushed out before they get the experience that makes them valuable because of one hard fact, he said: “You&#39;re either making money for the firm or you&#39;re a cost for the firm.”</p><p> The Journal spoke with more than 30 current, former and prospective consultants.

Still, there&#39;s free time, and many are working from home when they&#39;re not on client teams.</p><p> One benched consultant said he&#39;s had two client-facing projects since starting last fall. When he can&#39;t find anything work-related to fill the time, he goes for walks, buys groceries, takes naps or streams shows like Amazon Prime Video&#39;s “Fakes.”</p><p> Another hired around the same time said she has done billable client work for one three-month stretch. With an eye on the project pipeline, she uses her spare time for prepping meals and spending time with family. She&#39;s also job hunting.</p><p> A third, London-based Claudia Zhu, had a two-week break between projects in January. In May, she had another. Zhu, who is 25 years old and works at a large firm, used some of the time to work on internal business development or clean up slides from past projects.</p><p> Otherwise, she sometimes hit the treadmill in the morning and cooked instead of buying meals. After a busy period last year, she says, “there was a very clear decrease in demand in the market.” She&#39;s not complaining about a little extra free time, however: “It was very much needed.”</p><p> Too much time on the bench makes it harder for consultants to develop the strategic-thinking and communication skills that catapult them into their next jobs, said Matt Sigelman, a former McKinsey consultant who is president of the Burning Glass Institute, a think tank focused on the future of work.</p><p> “Part of the social capital that somebody builds at a firm like one of these is developed in the intense pressure-cooker of a client-team room,” he said.</p><h3> Pressure and polish</h3><p> One reason young consultants don&#39;t have enough work right now is that there are so many of them, as firms staffed up to tackle a pandemic surge in business. Head count at McKinsey grew to about 46,000 in 2023 from 17,000 in 2012.

"><div class="media-object-rich-text"><h4>分享你的意见</h4><p><em>Should the US take precautionary measures against Saudi Arabia&#39;s tightening grip on OPEC?加入下面的对话。</em></p></div></div><p> Saudi Arabia announced the voluntary production cut after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-some-opec-members-clash-over-oil-production-quotas-87f43f0c?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">a fiery meeting</a> at the OPEC headquarters in Vienna in June. Several producers, especially some from Africa, pushed back against Saudi Arabia&#39;s insistence that they slash their quotas to help support prices amid concerns over slowing global energy demand, OPEC delegates said.</p><p> Saudi Arabia, OPEC&#39;s biggest exporter, wants to keep oil prices at the levels it needs to fund Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman&#39;s plans to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabias-oil-production-cuts-reflect-cost-of-reshaping-economy-7fb6e09c?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">reshape the kingdom&#39;s oil-dependent economy</a> . Oil sales are the biggest revenue earner for the Saudi government.</p><p> The broader 23-member group, called OPEC+, accounts for close to half of the world&#39;s oil output. Each member of the cartel is allotted a production quota. A cut in quotas could squeeze revenues in the long run for the smaller producers who often also face challenges in raising production again, some OPEC members and analysts say.</p><p> The Saudi decision to voluntarily cut output helped keep the June meeting from completely blowing up, delegates said. Others in the group agreed to stick to current production targets. An oil-price rally in July has ensured that members of the cartel are playing along for now, some cartel members and analysts say.</p><p> “The June meeting was a turning point,” said Homayoun Falakshahi, a senior oil analyst at commodities-data firm Kpler. “For now it&#39;s working because prices are high.”</p><p> Brent crude, the international oil benchmark, has risen firmly back above $80 a barrel after jumping 13% in July, its biggest monthly gain in a year and a half. It was up 0.5% at $85.61 a barrel early Friday, building on recent gains after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would extend efforts to keep crude supplies tight.</p><p> Saudi Arabia has long been OPEC&#39;s de facto leader thanks to investments in spare capacity—the ability to keep significant amounts of production idle and reopen it at short notice—initiated in the 1970s. Over the decades, the Saudis kept the group together largely by ensuring that every member felt it had a voice.</p><p> Under Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, that now appears to be changing. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Both Wall Street Journal reporters who cover OPEC also were excluded, but other Journal reporters did get invitations. When invitations were denied again for an OPEC seminar for business leaders in Vienna in July, the cartel&#39;s members warned the move could hurt the organization&#39;s image, which has already taken a hit as it defies calls from global leaders to boost production and help ease inflation.</p><p> The Saudi Energy Ministry is also pressing OPEC to hire its current spokesman as head of the cartel&#39;s media relations, say people familiar with the matter. That would give Riyadh greater control on the cartel&#39;s messaging, they added.</p><p> The kingdom already holds sway over OPEC&#39;s research department, led by a Saudi national, which determines its assessment of the market and how much the group should pump. Riyadh has also pressured trade outlets that track OPEC production and exports to comply with its own assessments, said people familiar with the matter. </p><div class="media-object scope-

As oil prices hit $100 a barrel last year following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the kingdom accelerated those efforts.</p><p> Saudi economic advisers in recent months have privately warned senior policy makers that the kingdom needs elevated oil prices for the next five years to keep spending billions of dollars on projects that have so far attracted meager foreign investment.</p><p> It remains unclear how the unilateral production cuts will eventually impact Saudi revenues. While oil prices have risen to a three-month high, the cut has taken Saudi Arabia&#39;s output to nine million barrels a day, a level that is the lowest since June 2021 and rarely seen in the past 10 years.</p><p> Saudi oil exports were already down by almost 40% in May from the same period a year ago, recent data from the General Authority for Statistics shows. The value of oil exports declined to 72 billion Saudi riyals, or about $19.2 billion, in May from 115.5 billion riyals last year, the authority said.</p><p> Any opposition against Saudi Arabia&#39;s moves has so far largely remained private as most of the nations that once competed with Riyadh in the cartel have lost clout. </p><div class="media-object scope-

The conviction cast a shadow over Gandhi&#39;s political future ahead of the 2024 elections, in which Modi is expected to return for a third term. It also presented a fresh setback to the Congress Party, which has long revolved around Gandhi&#39;s family.</p><p> Gandhi was disqualified from Parliament in March after a lower court in the western state of Gujarat convicted and sentenced him to two years in prison for making remarks during a campaign speech in 2019 in which he referred to “thieves” as sharing the surname Modi.</p><p> “Why do all these thieves have Modi as their surnames?

A shorter sentence wouldn&#39;t have required Gandhi&#39;s disqualification as a lawmaker.</p><p> “We are of the considered view that since no reason has been given for maximum sentencing, the order of conviction needs to be stayed,” said the court.</p><p> Gandhi appealed to the Supreme Court after the Gujarat High Court declined to stay the conviction in July. His prison sentence was earlier suspended by a lower court in Gujarat.</p><p> In his submission to the top court, Gandhi pleaded not guilty of defamation, stating that as a leader of the opposition it is necessary for him to critically evaluate the conduct and performance of the government.</p><p> Congress supporters project Gandhi as a challenger to Prime Minister Modi. Last year, he led a unity walk across India, evoking his party&#39;s history as a counter to the Hindu nationalism of the ruling party. In recent months, the party has been leading an effort to unite like-minded political parties to jointly contest against the BJP.
