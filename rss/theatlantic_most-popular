referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>杰森·阿尔丁音乐视频剧照</figcaption></figure>乡村音乐明星杰森·阿尔丁对小镇私刑主义的颂歌所取得的商业成功有助于解释唐纳德·特朗普对红色美国的持续控制。<br><br>阿尔丁的好斗新歌《在小镇尝试》以音乐方式重复了特朗普自从政以来所表达的核心信息：保守派认为美国正遭受来自多元文化、城市化现代社会的非同寻常的攻击。留下任何必要的手段来消除威胁都是合理的。<br><br>在阿尔丁的歌词和他为歌曲制作的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1_RKu-ESCY">视频</a>中，这些非凡的手段围绕着治安维持力量的威胁，以坚守阵线，打击他所描述的大城市的犯罪和混乱。在特朗普的政治信息中，这些手段是他为了“让美国再次伟大”而系统性地破坏国家规范和潜在的法律。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/trumps-rhetoric-of-white-nostalgia/485192/">阅读：特朗普关于白人怀旧的言论</a><br><br>与特朗普一样，阿尔丁也利用了共和党基础选民普遍存在的焦虑情绪，即他们的价值观在文化和种族多样性不断增加的不断变化的美国中被边缘化。每个人都传达出这样的信息：需要采取极端措施，甚至延伸到暴力，才能防止这种流离失所。<br><br> “即使对于家乡的主流保守派选民来说……我们必须进行文化反革命的想法已经根深蒂固，”保守派道德与公共政策中心的研究员帕特里克·布朗告诉我。 “乡村音乐是实现这一目标的一个渠道这一事实一点也不令人惊讶。”<br><br>阿尔丁的好战歌谣<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.american1.com/aldeans-anthem-stirs-controversy-singer-stands-firm/?fbclid=IwAR1dJFKfDIccobxruZSvRQ-__dL3B0EB9FX3wa2g_k4gAww6LhTU8KlROdY_aem_AaykaK9c4E033DtERVYBeawFQjIYpdx_m03qA0kVTummaZB4hShbSnkaKyA3RB09stk&amp;mibextid=2JQ9oc">在受到批评者谴责后，下载量增加了十倍以上</a>，它遵循了乡村歌曲反对对美国现状的挑战的传统。这种抵制在李·格林伍德 (Lee Greenwood) 的早期里程碑作品《上帝保佑美国》(God Bless the USA) 中得到了体现，该书自 1984 年发行以来一直是共和党集会的主要内容。阿尔丁甚至更直接地引用了梅尔·哈格德 (Merle Haggard) 1970 年的乡村大片，该片警告那些反对越南战争和“破坏我的国家”的人，正如标题所宣称的那样，将会看到“我战斗的一面”。 （此前，哈格德在他 1969 年的热门歌曲《 <i>Okie From Muskogee》</i>中表达了类似的想法，该歌曲颂扬了美国小镇，“我们不会在大街上烧掉我们的选秀卡。”）<br><br>在理查德·尼克松担任总统期间，哈加德的歌曲（他后来的矛盾心理）成为保守派的颂歌，就像罗纳德·里根执政期间格林伍德的歌曲一样。这个时机并非巧合：在这两个时期，这些领导人都将共和党定义为反对扰乱国家的社会变革。这又是一个这样的时刻：特朗普将自己的吸引力集中在将自己描绘成他的支持者与一系列影子势力之间的最后一道防线——包括“全球主义精英”、“深层政府”、暴力的城市少数群体和无证移民——据称威胁他们。<br><br>阿尔丁虽然是特朗普的坚定支持者，但他是一名表演者，而不是政治家；他的歌表达的是一种态度，而不是一个节目。然而，阿尔丁和特朗普都利用了保守派白人基督徒中普遍存在的信念，尤其是阿尔丁神话般的小镇上的基督徒，他们认为，在一个不可阻挡地变得更加多元化、世俗化和城市化的社会中，他们是偏见的真正受害者。<br><br>自2016年特朗普首次当选以来的多项全国民意调查中，十分之九的共和党人表示美国的基督教受到攻击；多达四分之三的人同意，对白人的偏见现在与对少数族裔的歧视一样严重；大约十分之七的人同意，社会只是因为表现得像男人而惩罚男人，而且白人现在是美国社会最受歧视的群体。<br><br>相信特朗普也有这些担忧，并致力于解决这些问题，这一信念始终是他与共和党选民联系的关键。每当他做了或说了一些看似站不住脚的事情时，共和党选民就会聚集在他周围——即使在 1 月 6 日的叛乱中，这一过程现在似乎仍在重复。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://brightlinewatch.org/uncharted-territory-the-aftermath-of-presidential-indictments/">在由研究美国民主威胁的政治学家合作组织 Bright Line Watch 昨天发布的一项全国调查中</a>，60% 的共和党人（相比之下只有三分之一的独立人士和六分之一的民主党人）将 1 月 6 日的骚乱描述为合法的政治事件反对。只有略高于十分之一的共和党人表示，特朗普在 1 月 6 日或在其推翻 2020 年总统选举结果的更广泛竞选活动中的行为犯了罪行。<br><br> 1 月 6 日保守派中的修正主义粉饰有助于解释为什么阿尔丁在没有任何明显的矛盾或讽刺感的情况下，可以将他的歌曲集中在“好男孩，正确举起”的暴力幻想上，对那些“咒骂警察”的人进行惩罚”或“践踏国旗”。特朗普的支持者，其中许多人可能符合阿尔丁对“好男孩”的描述，他们在 2021 年袭击国会大厦时正是做了这些事情。（例​​如，1 月 6 日来自阿肯色州的骚乱者，本周被判处 52 个月监禁）因用旗帜袭击警察<i>而</i>被监禁。）然而，阿尔丁将这些歌词与不是叛乱的图像，而是在城市街道上横冲直撞的阴暗抗议者的图像结合在一起。<br><br>阿尔丁无视 1 月 6 日的袭击事件，同时强调 2020 年乔治·弗洛伊德被谋杀后有时与大规模种族正义抗议活动一起爆发的左翼暴力，阿尔丁和特朗普一样，明确声明了他认为这项法律的目的是针对谁。保护和压制的对象。该视频在视觉上强调了这一信息，因为它是在田纳西州法院外拍摄的，一名年轻的黑人于 1927 年在那里被私刑处死。阿尔丁表示，他不知道其中的联系，并且否认这首歌中有任何种族主义意图。但正如范德比尔特大学历史学家妮可·海默 (Nicole Hemmer) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/20/opinions/opinion-jason-aldean-video-cmt-vigilantism-hemmer/index.html">上周为 CNN.com 所写的那样</a>，“无论他承认与否，阿尔丁的歌曲和一名少年被谋杀的法院都提醒人们，从历史上看，诉诸所谓的法律和秩序往往既依赖于正式的法律程序，也依赖于白人的自卫行为。”<br><br>最重要的是，阿尔丁的歌曲捕捉到了右翼被围困的感觉。它在流行文化中反映出共和党基础中同样的好斗情绪，自特朗普 2020 年失败以来，这种好斗情绪鼓励全国各地的共和党领导人在几乎所有方面对民主党和自由派利益采取更激进的策略。<br><br>例如，田纳西州的共和党立法多数派<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/04/tennessee-expulsions-republican-gop/673709/">驱逐了两名年轻的黑人民主党州代表</a>，蒙大拿州的共和党多数派谴责了一名跨性别民主党州代表，并禁止她参加会议。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/12/republican-states-rights-restrictions/621101/">共和党控制的州正在推进</a>煽动性政策，这些政策在几年前可能被认为是不可想象的， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/texass-immigration-policy-biden/674784/">比如德克萨斯州政府通过在边境安装刀片刺网和在格兰德河漂浮浮标来阻止移民的计划</a>。众议院议长凯文·麦卡锡提出弹劾乔·拜登的可能性。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/bud-light-boycott-consumer-effect/674446/">百威淡啤仅仅因为与跨性别影响者合作</a>开展促销项目而遭到抵制，这代表了右翼广泛反革命的另一个战线。特朗普在竞选中承诺进一步升级：他表示，如果连任，他将以前所未有的方式动员联邦权力，对保守派针对蓝色目标进行所谓的“报复”，例如，派遣国民警卫队进入民主党——管理城市打击犯罪，推行大规模的无证移民驱逐计划，并公开部署司法部来对付他的政治对手。<br><br>道德与公共政策中心的布朗指出，尽管州和国家层面的共和党人都在推动这一令人毛骨悚然的议程，但他们认为自己并不是在发动一场文化战争，而是在回应媒体自由派针对他们发起的一场文化战争。 、学术界、大公司和倡导团体。他说，共和党人的主流观点是“我们正试图在这里采取防御行动。我们没有侵略；我们正在受到侵略。”<br><br>在不断发展的美国，对被流离失所的恐惧已经成为激励共和党选民的最强大力量<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/11/the-coalition-of-transformation-vs-the-coalition-of-restoration/265512/">——我称之为</a>“复辟联盟”。从政治生涯一开始，特朗普就瞄准了这种感觉<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/06/trumps-rhetoric-of-white-nostalgia/485192/">，承诺“让美国<i>再次伟大”。</i>阿尔丁</a>同样回顾了他对美国未来的愿景， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://people.com/jason-aldean-stands-by-controversial-song-during-ohio-tour-stop-7564414">在一场音乐会上为他的歌曲辩护，表达了</a>他希望看到美国“在所有这些废话开始发生在我们身上之前，恢复到原来的样子”。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/working-class-white-voters-gop-house-agenda/673500/">阅读：工人阶级白人选民如何成为共和党的基础</a><br><br>正如布朗指出的那样，2024 年共和党总统竞选已经成为一场谁最致力于与左翼斗争、挖掘失去的美国的竞争。阿尔丁的歌曲和视频有助于解释原因。他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/06/red-and-blue-state-divide-is-growing-michael-podhorzer-newsletter/661377/">为该国红蓝阵营之间日益加深的冷战</a>写了一首战斗进行曲。在他的讲述中，就像特朗普一样，传统上保守的美国白人正受到社会力量的威胁，这些力量将抹去他们的生活方式。对于蓝色美国来说，阿尔丁描述的进程代表着一场早该进行的重新谈判，因为少数族裔和 LGBTQ 群体等先前被边缘化的群体需要更多的影响力和包容性。在《红色美国》中，他描述了一种需要无条件抵抗的生存威胁。<br><br>民意调查显示，尽管针对特朗普的可信刑事指控不断增加，但大多数共和党人正在通过在 2024 年提名竞选中再次团结起来支持特朗普来应对这一威胁。但《在小镇尝试一下》的真正信息是，无论特朗普个人发生什么，共和党联盟中的大多数选民几乎肯定会继续要求领导人，就像阿尔丁所说的“从小培养的好男孩”一样，他们渴望着与他们认为危及世界的一切事物作斗争。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 16:02:00

20 世纪 70 年代开始，一系列经济和社会政策决策导致了政治学家雅各布·哈克 (Jacob Hacker) 所说的从政府和企业到家庭的“ <a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/01/summer-day-camps-activities-childcare/672837/">夏令营</a>等基本服务，而且他们在很大程度上依靠自己来应对任何故障。<br><br> <a

告诉我的那样，“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.demos.org/sites/default/files/publications/Scheduling_Hourly_Workers_Demos.pdf">即时调度</a>”模式已显着增加，这种模式下，企业以最少的员工进行运营，这些员工可以在很短的时间内被召回或送回家。

<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/02/17/health/formula-shortage-one-year-later/index.html">表示，在货架再次被填满后，他们对配方奶粉供应仍心存恐惧和焦虑</a>。<br><br>无论一个人的银行账户有多少，这种持续的不稳定都会造成情感上的损失。研究表明，自大流行之前以来， <a

20 世纪最后 25 年的父母更缺乏可预测性。正如斯坦福大学社会学家玛丽安·库珀 (Marianne Cooper) 在<a data-event-element="inline link"

年代带来了收入的大幅增加和工作的不稳定。<br><br>此外，直到过去几十年，社会机构和债券已经做好了更好的准备来弥补这一差距。工会、兄弟会，尤其是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/28/opinion/religion-affiliation-community.html">信仰团体</a>不仅提供联系感，还提供物质支持，例如产后膳食或可以在紧要关头照顾孩子的值得信赖的人。这些网络的成员数量一直在稳步下降。<br><br>然而，永久的颤抖并不是不可避免的。政策制定者既可以稳定地面，又可以帮助家庭应对地震。第一步是将健康、可预测的家庭生活作为政策优先事项。加强儿童保育体系、提供强有力的带薪休假、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fortune.com/2023/04/17/irs-phone-wait-times-taxes/">对公共服务进行再投资</a>并降低<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/how-government-learned-waste-your-time-tax/619568/">其行政负担</a>以及限制及时调度的法律，都是将风险从家庭转移回政府和企业的方法。作为一项指导原则，政策制定者应减少混乱，解放父母和儿童，加深他们彼此之间以及社区的联系。<br><br>也许现状最可悲的是，这本应该是一个家庭充满奇迹的时代。我们生活在一个现代医学已经消除了许多儿童疾病并定期开发新<a

href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06137-x"><em>《自然》杂志</em></a>上发表了对这一现象的系统研究。<br><br>马斯楚安尼记录道，这种模糊的记忆是许多不同人群所共有的，并且感受相当强烈。他解释了这种幻觉是如何运作的，以及为什么它对我们有如此大的影响力。最重要的是，他解释了它如何不仅扭曲我们的个人关系，而且扭曲我们的文化和政治。在<em>大西洋广播电台</em>的这一集中，我与马斯楚安尼和特约撰稿人朱莉·贝克谈论了道德衰退的幻觉，以及为什么它如此强烈地持续存在。<br><br><em>每当</em><em>政治家或有抱负的政治家声称，“事情曾经更好，让我负责，我会让它们再次变得更好”时，这是我们听过很多次的非常古老的事情。它引起了我们的共鸣，也许是因为我们准备相信它，即使它不是真的。</em><br><br>请听这里的对话：

[<em>笑声</em>] 邮差过来了，你知道，他向我脱帽致意，还有老人在遛狗。<br><br>而且，你知道，我不知道这个记忆是否准确，但我确实有这样的感觉：人们更加友善。<br><br><strong>朱莉·贝克：</strong>你是在<em>罗杰斯先生的街区</em>长大的吗？或者那是什么？<br><br><strong>松香：</strong>没有；我实际上是在纽约皇后区长大的。所以这可能是、当然不是真的。 [<em>笑声。</em> ]<br><br>这是<em>大西洋广播电台</em>。我是汉娜·罗辛。我邀请我的同事朱莉·贝克来谈论一些一直困扰我的事情。当人们谈论今天的情况比过去糟糕得多时。<br><br>他们会说“邻居以前比较友善，每个人都对你微笑并帮助你。”有时只是爷爷的闲聊，你几乎可以忽略它。有时又会变成“男人是男人，女人是女人”之类的事情，这更烦人。<br><br><strong><em>贝克：</em></strong><em>有一个善意的愿望，比如向邮递员致敬。然后是“哦，我们需要恢复 20 世纪 50 年代的社会秩序。”然后你会想，“哇，我们怎么到了这里？”</em><br><br>朱莉分析心理学研究和社会趋势，她还是另一个大西洋播客<em>“如何与人交谈”</em>的主持人。<br><br>她来这里是为了帮助我理解这项刚刚出现的非常有趣的研究，该研究表明人们坚信一切都变得更糟了。<br><br><strong><em>亚当·马斯楚安尼</em></strong><strong>：</strong><em>我一生都听到人们这样说，“你过去可以在晚上不锁门”，或者“你不能再相信别人的话了。”</em><br><br><em>我总是对这类言论感到恼火。所以部分原因是想证明每个人都错了。但其中也有一部分是这样的，</em>好吧，如果他们是对的，这就是一个大问题。<em>这就是我们开始的地方。</em><br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>那是亚当·马斯楚安尼。他最近在<em>《自然》杂志</em>上发表了一篇名为《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-illusion-of-moral-decline">道德衰退的幻觉</a>》的论文。亚当是一位心理学家，也是科学博客<em>“实验历史”的作者。</em>他花了十年时间系统地研究为什么我们感觉过去的情况更好……以及这意味着什么。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>我认为我读研究生的第一年是特朗普当选的时候。很明显，这是“让美国再次伟大”成为当今时代氛围的时刻。<br><br>看到“过去是好的，现在是坏的，让我负责，我可以带回美好的过去”的说法也让我明白了这比叔叔、姐夫和人们在互联网上说这些话——这些说法引起了人们的共鸣，它们有助于让人们进入椭圆形办公室。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。我的意思是，我不得不说，这就是我对你的研究感兴趣的动机，因为我一直对为什么这句话引起如此强烈的共鸣有一种超然的好奇心。<br><br>比如，为什么——不仅是美国领导人，全世界的领导人——他们只要说：“哦，那时的情况好多了”，人们就会立刻明白这一点？就像，他们甚至不需要解释。你可以说：“你知道，让美国再次伟大。”这就像四个字，所有的假设都立刻就出现在人们面前。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。当我在学术背景下就这篇论文发表演讲时，我首先是特朗普就职演说的结尾，他在演讲中说：“你知道，我们将使美国再次富裕、再次自豪、再次安全、再次伟大。”我指出，这些句子中最重要的词不是<em>“美国”</em> 、 <em>“安全</em>”、 <em>“自豪”</em> 、 <em>“强大”</em>或<em>“伟大”</em> 。<em>又来了</em>。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是啊！<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>光是这个词就可以起到很大的作用。那就是：嗯，如果过去一切都很好但现在却不同了，那就意味着事情发生了变化。这意味着我们可以将其改回来。它唤起了一种失落感，但也唤起了一种恢复损失的可能性的感觉。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。<em>又</em>是这个词，就好像一个小小的词可以在情感上解决人们的一些问题。很难确切地理解它是如何工作的，但你<em>再说一遍</em>这个词，每个人都会说，“啊，你刚刚为我填补了一个洞。”你知道？当你说“道德沦丧”时，你到底是什么意思？如果这是一种幻觉，为什么感觉如此真实？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>关于人们在谈论道德衰退时可能会想到什么，有一些完全合理的假设。也许每个人的意思都是，“我听说 20 世纪 50 年代是一段非常美好的时光。所以我真正要告诉你的是，从那时起，情况已经有所下降。”并不是说过去10年情况变得更糟；而是说他们的情况在过去10年里变得更糟。你知道，20 年前或 50 年前，情况变得更糟。我们现在正生活在困难时期。<br><br>在后来的一项研究中，我们要求人们回溯得更早。 “那20年前呢？那40年前呢？”他们告诉我们的是——“在我到达之前，什么也没有发生。一切都很好。然后我出生了，然后一切就开始走下坡路了。”<br><br>特别有趣的是：你出生的时间并不重要。所以30岁的人告诉我们这发生在30年前。 60岁的人告诉我们这发生在60年前。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>等等，真的吗？那么从字面上看，人们认为衰落是在他们来到这个地球时就开始的吗？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。所以，我的意思是，我们不会问前一天或后一天。但我们提出的问题是：“评价一下当今人们的善良、诚实、友善和优秀程度。那你20岁的那一年呢？”人们告诉我们那时更好。<br><br> “那你的出生年份呢？”人们告诉我们，那时的情况甚至更好。然后我们问：“那 20 年前呢？那40年前呢？”<br><br>人们的答案没有什么不同。那条线是平的。直到我们问到“你出生20年后”时，电话才停下来。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>这太有趣了。我认为我没有完全理解这一点。因此，人们将生活中的任何个人困难或挣扎（现在也许是我的推断）投射到整个人类身上，就像他们将自己的寿命保护到历史的、更广泛的文化、政治寿命上。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。我的意思是，这是人们记忆的偏差，因为你没有出生之前的记忆。你确实拥有出生后大部分时间的记忆。<br><br>因此，如果这是一种记忆偏差，那么它在你出生的那一刻附近的某个时间就会开启，这是有道理的。显然不完全是这样，但这可以解释为什么我们看不到人们在出生之前和之后的想法。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>你年轻真的不重要吗？你知道，刻板印象显然是辛普森爷爷。就好像，老年人总是在谈论过去的事情如何更好，但年轻人却不一定。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的；我们完全期望也能找到这一点，但我们并没有真正找到。因此，当你问人们一生中所感受到的衰退时，年轻人和老年人所感受到的衰退并没有什么不同。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>朱莉，我很惊讶地发现老年人和年轻人对这种道德下降的看法没有区别。我的意思是，你不是一个老人；你是一个老人。你年轻。那么你还记得曾经有过这种感觉吗？<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>我清楚地记得我直到 2013 年搬到华盛顿才拥有智能手机。所以在那之前的几年里，当我住在芝加哥时，我记得在街上与陌生人进行了很多互动。<br><br>我绝对不会再像以前那样频繁地拥有这些了。我认为这只是因为我们都在看手机，对吧？所以我的一部分有点浪漫化了，你知道的，前智能手机时代的偶遇以及所有这些。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。当我听到你这么说时，我想，<em>哦，朱莉有这种感觉很好，我有这种感觉也很好。</em>但如果我把它乘以几百万倍，那么我就会得到“让我们回到事情更好的时代”的政治运动，而我真的不太喜欢。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>是的。这也让我想到的一件事是，一系列研究发现，美国的社会信任实际上几十年来一直在下降。因此，人们基本上越来越不可能说大多数其他人通常是可以信任的。<br><br>所以你完全正确，认为过去更好、人们过去更值得信赖确实有很大的政治影响。<br><br>对我来说，这感觉就像是一个先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题。比如，我们是否因为相信人们的道德品质变得更差而减少对他们的信任？或者我们是否认为人们变得更糟是因为我们与社区更加脱节？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>我们在这里关注一个非常狭窄的问题，即“人们在日常生活中对待彼此的方式是否随着时间的推移而改变？”人们认为它有吗？<br><br>这是一个当事情糟糕时，他们很容易看起来事情变得更糟的模型。所以我不认为这是我们可能发现这种幻觉的唯一领域，因为人们对生活的很多不同部分都这么说。<br><br>你知道：艺术比以前更糟糕了。这种文化比以前更糟糕了。教育制度比以前更糟糕了。但对我来说，很明显我们倾向于相信这是真的，即使事实并非如此。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>您在这项研究中的假设是——人们认为某种道德已经下降。但在你心里，它并没有下降。所以对你来说，这就像一个幻觉。我的意思是，你称之为幻觉。正确的？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>好的。那么根据这个假设，你的解释是什么？比如，为什么我们大多数人都会在妄想/幻觉下运作？就像<em>你</em>所说的事情显然不是真的。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>我们认为两种认知偏差可以结合起来产生这种错觉。所以这个解释有两个部分。第一个是我们所说的偏见曝光，即人们倾向于关注主要是负面的信息，尤其是关于他们不认识的人的信息。<br><br> So this is both a combination of the information that they receive about people that they don&#39;t know, which is primarily negative, and the information that they pay attention to. So this is why when you look out at the world beyond your personal world, it looks like it&#39;s full of people who are doing bad things. They&#39;re lying and cheating and stealing and killing.<br><br> The second part of the explanation is what we call biased memory. Memory researchers have noticed that the badness of bad memories tends to fade faster than the goodness of good memories.<br><br> So if you got turned down for your high-school prom, it feels pretty bad at the time. Twenty years later, it&#39;s maybe a funny story. If you have a great high-school prom, it feels pretty good at the time. And 20 years later, it&#39;s still a pretty nice memory. It doesn&#39;t feel as nice as it did to experience it, but it still feels pretty nice.<br><br> And that turns out to be, on average, what happens to people&#39;s memories: that the bad ones inch toward neutral faster than the good ones do, And the bad ones are more likely to both be forgotten and to become good in retrospect.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> So when I read the paper, Hanna, I wondered whether what might be going on is that people are, to some degree, picking up on a real change in the world.<br><br> There&#39;s the decline of social trust—but also widespread loneliness and disconnection and the erosion of community life, in the sense of fewer people knowing their neighbors and declining membership in community organizations.<br><br> And all of those things definitely have an impact on people&#39;s personal lives. But I think it manifests as a vague feeling like, <em>Oh, it&#39;s just harder to make friends or harder to feel like I&#39;m a part of my community.</em><br><br> So I wonder if we&#39;re feeling this sort of vague and troubling sense of disconnection and assigning it a false explanation: that things used to be better before, and people just suck more than they used to.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh, that&#39;s really interesting. So what you&#39;re saying is the feeling is real. Like, the feeling that something has changed is real because something <em>has</em> changed. There is more disconnection and loneliness.<br><br> So instead we make up this very tidy story. Like, “When I was a kid, things were better and people were nicer and the mailman tipped his hat”—and we just kind of stopped there.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Yeah; there definitely are real things that are really happening that would make people feel disconnected from strangers around them. And I wonder if, yeah, we just have a hard time psychologically, knowing why that&#39;s the case.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So Adam, I want to run a couple of theories by you. One is the possibility that something has actually changed. And we&#39;re just calling it by the wrong name. That, like, something has declined. And this is from a different body of psychological research about social trust.<br><br> That there is a change in our isolation, our sense of connectedness, our face-to-ace contact. Like there are some societal changes which are real and structural and have kind of left a hole in us that we are misnaming <em>morality</em> .<br><br> When we read it here, we thought there are some things that are changing and that do leave us a little despairing—and maybe we&#39;re just calling them by the wrong name.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Like we have this incredibly powerful feeling that something is wrong, and that “something” is connectedness or community or something like that.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah. So it&#39;s very easy to slip from “People are less kind than they used to be” to <em>“Things</em> are worse than they used to be.” And so it is true that trust in institutions has declined over time. A lot of people also say that interpersonal trust has declined over time. And I actually think that case is much more overstated than the decline in institutional trust.<br><br> There&#39;s some work by a guy named Richard Eibach on how people think the world has gotten more dangerous. And he finds that people believe this. And the people who believe this, especially, are parents. And when you ask those parents “When did the world become more dangerous?,” you get a date that is curiously close to the date of the birth of their first child.<br><br> The obvious implication being that nothing about the world changed. It was your worldview that changed. And now you have to, you know, protect this fragile life—and so you are much more attuned to the dangers of the world. That&#39;s why you think there&#39;s more of them.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> You know, Julie, I have this conversation with my brother all the time, and he&#39;s always telling me his kids aren&#39;t safe. He lives in New York. He&#39;s like, “My kids aren&#39;t safe. They can&#39;t go outside. They can&#39;t go down the block.” Like, he really freaks out, you know? And: “It&#39;s way less safe than it was when we were kids.” And I&#39;m like, “Dude, we grew up in New York in the &#39;70s, right?” It was really not safe.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Like, statistically.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Statistically. And I&#39;ve shown him news articles, and I once pulled out an FBI report. I specially downloaded an FBI report that showed, you know, crime statistics in New York from when we were kids.<br><br> And his conviction is so strong about this. I can&#39;t budge him. I can&#39;t show him enough numbers or statistics to make him think, <em>Oh, things aren&#39;t worse now</em> .<br><br> I mean, Adam Mastroianni actually has a term for this. This is a little mean to my brother, but his term is <em>unearned conviction</em> . And I think what he means by that is exactly this. It&#39;s like: Your conviction is incredibly strong, even though you have really no basis to back up the story that you&#39;re attaching to that very strong conviction.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Yeah. I mean it seems like, regardless of the FBI report, the story your brother is telling himself is super-emotionally resonant.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yes.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> And the stories that we tell ourselves about our own lives really do sort of shape who we are. It&#39;s really interesting, because when we tell these stories to ourselves about our personal lives, a lot of times those stories fall into one of two categories. One being redemptive and the other being contamination.<br><br> And so a redemptive story is like: “I have suffered through these trials and come out stronger for it, and things are looking up.” Whereas a contamination story is like: “These trials have conquered me, and I am now broken and fundamentally a worse person.”<br><br> And it probably won&#39;t surprise you to hear that contamination sequences are not great for people&#39;s mental health. That research was done with stories that we&#39;re telling about our personal lives. But it feels like we&#39;re kind of telling a contamination story about all of humanity.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I guess what&#39;s depressing to me is: Why are those the ones that stick? I mean, there are redemption stories that are popular in American society.<br><br> But I feel like in a lot of moments in history, and now is one of them, these contamination stories—like “America was great once” or “Russia was great once”—have a particular kind of emotional juice and can really rally people.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Yeah. I mean, maybe it&#39;s kind of like your brother&#39;s fear in New York, right? Where it&#39;s just like—that is so viscerally emotional. It&#39;s the safety of your kid. And so, of course, that&#39;s going to have like a way stronger impact.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Now Adam, did you find any appreciable differences between demographics? So if not between old and young people, what about gender differences, or people with different political ideologies?<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> We didn&#39;t find any gender differences. We didn&#39;t find any differences by racial groups. We didn&#39;t find any education differences. The only other demographic difference that we found was an ideological one, a political one. The people who self-identified as more conservative perceived more decline over time than the people who self-identified as liberal.<br><br> But even for the people who were the most liberal, they still said that people are less kind today than they were 10 years ago, 20 years ago, or whatever point in the past. So this is something that conservatives said louder, but liberals said as well.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So someone who identifies as a liberal could believe that there&#39;s less racism and sexism—but still believe that those other general universal markers of morality have declined.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yes. And in fact, it seems like they do. In our studies, the much smaller group of people who say that people are better now than they used to be—when we asked them “Why? What were you thinking of?,” one thing that does come up for them is there&#39;s more tolerance. There&#39;s less racism, sexism, ableism; all the <em>isms</em> .<br><br> So it seems like that&#39;s not what people are spontaneously thinking of when they say that people are less kind than they used to be. Because if you ask them directly, “Do you think that, for instance, people treat African Americans with more respect and courtesy or less than in the past?,” a majority of people will say more today than in the past.<br><br> But if you ask them, “Are people more or less kind today?,” they&#39;ll go less kind. So this is not what they&#39;re thinking of when they answer the question.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. So it&#39;s a really, really specific feeling. I definitely think that people treat each other with more respect, largely because we have broadened the window of who is allowed to be respected, and sort of patriarchal notions of control over people&#39;s bodies and who gets to make decisions. I mean, there&#39;s so many ways in which we have opened the door to fairness and equity. I&#39;d much rather be alive today than 50 years ago, for sure.<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah, I agree. And so I think it was especially surprising that I&#39;m sure there are many other people who agree. But even some of the people who do agree—they seem to think like, <em>Yeah, but that actually doesn&#39;t come from people&#39;s heart of hearts</em> . That they&#39;re actually still worse to one another now than they used to be.<br><br> Yeah; they&#39;ll say all the right things or they&#39;ll have the right opinions. But you know, they won&#39;t hold the door open for you, or they&#39;ll cheat you when they can. Now people know the right things to say, but they still <em>do</em> more of the bad things.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Do we feel the same way with people we know? Does it play out differently in our personal lives?<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> You can actually also produce an illusion of improvement. You actually primarily hear good things and experience good things about people that you know. And so we thought that in your personal world, this illusion of decline might be turned down or turned off or even reversed.<br><br> And people told us: “People in general? Worse today than they were 15 years ago. People that I have known for the last 15 years? Better today than they were 15 years ago.”<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So Julie, one thing that Adam found that I thought was so interesting was that people we know—like our own people, people we&#39;re close to or whatever—they&#39;re somehow getting better over time, and yet the general public are getting worse. I don&#39;t quite understand how those fit together.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> So I guess we just think the moral decline is happening with strangers, with all those <em>other</em> people.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> And it seems like potentially the disconnection from community that many people are experiencing could just mean that we&#39;re slotting more people into the “morally compromised, untrustworthy” category.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right. Like, if we met more people and we had more casual acquaintances and we went to our bowling leagues or whatever, then we might include more people in that circle of people we know. And those people are good people. So that could sort of spiral upward rather than what&#39;s happening, which is a momentum downward.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Adam&#39;s study kind of seems to say that if you get to know people, then you won&#39;t think they&#39;re on a downward slope of moral depravity anymore.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> For one thing, Adam, it sounds to me like the problem is that people are absolutely certain. Like they&#39;re not questioning. Was the past a worse place? It&#39;s a sort of lack of humility. Because if you try to understand, “Well, maybe what did get worse?,” then you would come up with more specific and useful policy solutions.<br><br> I mean, I assume one reason you did this research is to point out a mistake. Like, we&#39;re all living under this delusion. And in your head—since you sound like a fairly optimistic person—is it “knowledge is power,” and people will know, and then they will stop? What&#39;s the aim, or what&#39;s your wish here?<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni:</strong> Yeah. I mean, as a psychologist I a little bit despair of changing people&#39;s minds, because I know how difficult it is. It doesn&#39;t work the way that we think that it works, like, “Oh, you have the wrong model of the world. How about I give you the correct facts, and now you have the correct model of the world?” When does that ever happen? When has that ever happened to me? Like, never.<br><br> And one effect that I certainly hope that this has is: Whenever politicians or aspiring politicians make the claim that, you know, “Things used to be better, and put me in charge and I&#39;ll make them better again”—that&#39;s a very old thing that we&#39;ve heard many times. And it resonates with us, perhaps because we are primed to believe it, even when it&#39;s not true.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> So, Hanna, now that we know this is an illusion, right, that&#39;s very interesting. But will it actually change how you feel?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I don&#39;t really know. I mean, I feel like as a journalist, it depresses me a little bit because I spent a lot of time researching and marshaling facts, like I did with my brother. And to think that emotions ultimately squash all of that—I don&#39;t really know what to do with that.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Yeah.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> But in my own personal life, awareness is helpful. I don&#39;t think any bad can come from understanding your own emotional levers better. It&#39;s not that it immediately leads to a change, but I don&#39;t think it can ever be bad to understand, <em>Oh, I&#39;m having this emotional attachment or strong belief, and that&#39;s leading me to behave in this way.</em> That in and of itself is a small daily miracle. So that&#39;s good enough.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> <em>Listeners, if you enjoyed this conversation with Adam Mastroianni and Julie Beck, and if you generally like learning about these psychological levers that are guiding our choices, Julie hosts a full season of conversations much like this one, on the Atlantic podcast</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/how-to-build-a-happy-life/">How to Talk to People</a> . <em>You can find it wherever you listen to podcasts.</em><br><br> This episode was produced by Becca Rashid.

The preferential admissions treatment that racial minorities received is just one bonus among many, however. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">new study</a> from the economic research group Opportunity Insights quantifies the advantages of wealth in higher education: The ultra rich are much likelier to gain admission to elite colleges than anyone else, even when controlling for academic success. Put another way, if you take a room full of 18-year-olds with the same SAT or ACT score, those from the top 1 percent are 55 percent more likely to be admitted than middle-class applicants. Those from the top 0.1 percent are 150 percent more likely to get in.<br><br> For decades, underrepresented minorities have faced accusations of unearned access. The implication of these resentments has always been that some people who deserve to go to Harvard have had their spots “taken” by Black, Latino, and Native American students who, absent efforts to tip the scales in their favor, would never have been granted admission. But no one “deserves” to gain admission anywhere. No university can construct a perfectly meritocratic system. How should an admissions program distinguish among tens of thousands of standout students fairly? Is publishing a best-selling novel more important than a perfect GPA? If a student with a mediocre GPA but a perfect SAT score explains their academic deficiency by pointing out that they were taking care of their sick parent, is it reasonable for an admissions officer to consider them more “meritorious” than a student with perfect grades <em>and</em> scores?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Annie Lowrey: Why you have to care about these 12 colleges</a><br><br> Any method of distinguishing among such applicants is inherently subjective, and any of the traits, acquired skills, or backgrounds that help push students over the edge could be considered “unearned advantage.” But none of those carries the stigma that race-based affirmative action does. The whispers of affirmative action never leave the people of color who enter into elite spaces; they become the targets of resentment for the unfulfilled ambitions of their fellow students and, later on, their colleagues.<br><br> A 1995 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/affirm/stories/aa032495.htm">dispatch</a> from <em>The Washington Post</em> highlights these resentments: “They talk about a glass ceiling for women and minorities. There&#39;s a glass ceiling for middle-aged white male managers too,” a 52-year-old worker living in Georgia tells the reporters. Another man aptly addresses the zero-sum nature of the conflict: “Why should I suffer so they can have a better chance in jobs or anything for that matter.”<br><br> Or take this monologue from <em>The West Wing</em> ’s CJ Cregg about why she&#39;s “the wrong Democrat” to defend affirmative action: “After my father fought in Korea, he became what this government begs every college graduate to become. He became a teacher. And he raised a family on a teacher&#39;s salary, and he paid his taxes and always crossed at the green. And any time there was an opportunity for career advancement, it took him an extra five years because invariably there was a less qualified Black woman in the picture. So instead of retiring as superintendent of the Ohio Valley Union Free School District, he retired head of the math department at William Henry Harrison Junior High.”<br><br> CJ thinks her father hit a glass ceiling put in place by a “less qualified Black woman,” a common villain in these stories of stunted careers.<br><br> Affirmative action is an albatross, whereas other forms of unearned privilege are, if anything, a sign of belonging. Most legacy kids don&#39;t try to hide their ancestral claims; they are proud of them, and so are their parents, who come to campus decked in university apparel. A Class of &#39;87 cap screams status far more loudly than an earnest “Proud Parent of …” T-shirt. Nor do the kids who row crew or play lacrosse conceal their participation in these résumé-padding pastimes. Later on in life, they eagerly share that they once rowed for Stanford.<br><br> This isn&#39;t just about the top 1 percent or even 10 percent. In a system that requires subjective discrimination, <em>no one</em> is objectively best qualified. Men have a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2015/07/30/achieving-perfect-gender-balance-on-campus-isnt-that-important-ending-private-colleges-affirmative-action-for-men-is/">much easier time getting into elite schools than women.</a> According to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/3/26/regional-diversity-scrutiny/"><em>The Harvard Crimson</em></a> , 51.5 percent of the noninternational students in the class of 2018 came from New York, New Jersey, California, or Massachusetts. Living in the United States is a form of unearned privilege as well; a genius in Ethiopia is less likely than the rich failson of an American lawyer to gain admission to one of our universities. It is perfectly legitimate for Americans to want our institutions to discriminate in our favor, but let&#39;s not pretend, then, that this is some fine-tuned exercise in picking the best and the brightest. The point is that we accept some forms of unearned advantage but not others. Born the son of a Harvard-educated lawyer who lives in Massachusetts?美好的。 Born Black? Unacceptable.<br><br> In 2022, the linguist John McWhorter, who opposes both racial and legacy preferences in admissions processes, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/01/opinion/affirmative-action.html">wrote</a> in <em>The New York Times</em> that “however unfair it may be, legacy admissions do not reflect on white students or white people, broadly speaking, in the same way [as affirmative action does on Black people].” McWhorter skips right over <em>why</em> even as he refers to legacy preferences as an “embarrassment” for universities.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/ban-legacy-college-admissions-nepotism/629566/">Richard V. Reeves: The shame deficit</a><br><br> But preferential treatment for legacies and the elite isn&#39;t embarrassing. The reason race-based affirmative action is not treated the same way as all of the other unearned advantages is because of the presumption that racial minorities don&#39;t belong in elite spaces. Elite people belong at Ivies. So do men. So do Americans. So do people who play water polo. So do flute players and the children of alumni. The unearned advantages we accept are the ones we have already decided are acceptable characteristics of the elite.<br><br> Could the Supreme Court&#39;s decision finally convince the general public that the Black students who <em>are</em> admitted belong? I doubt it. Jon Wang is one of the students who joined the plaintiffs in their successful effort to end race-conscious admissions. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.kron4.com/news/bay-area/asian-american-student-claims-affirmative-action-prevented-his-admissions-but-california-law-doesnt-allow-that/">blames</a> affirmative action for his rejection from a number of schools. Among them: UC Berkeley. That university has been legally prohibited from considering race and ethnicity in admissions since the late 1990s, a change that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cshe.berkeley.edu/publications/affirmative-action-mismatch-and-economic-mobility-after-california%E2%80%99s-proposition-209">significantly drove down admissions</a> of underrepresented minorities across the University of California system.<br><br> The sooner we accept that no one <em>deserves</em> to be an elite, the better. Should a handful of private institutions benefiting from billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies and tax breaks and other public monies get to select our political, economic, and cultural leaders behind closed doors? Sure, it&#39;s better if they do so without employing harmful racial stereotypes. Better still if they stop putting their thumbs on the scale for the top 0.1 percent. But fighting over the appropriate racial composition of the future white-collar lawyers and corporate consultants of America only legitimizes the enterprise to begin with.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 13:45:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/harvard-admissions-affirmative-action-elite-colleges/674837/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/harvard-admissions-affirmative-action-elite-colleges/674837/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[‘It’s Really First-Class Work’]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Watching <em>Oppenheimer</em> with Richard Rhodes, who wrote a definitive account of the Manhattan Project <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ila2DFKZYfKS9SJaSGJ3aKgB8OE=/0x83:1594x980/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/oppenheimer_inline_1/original.jpg" alt="希里安·墨菲 (Cillian Murphy) 在电影《奥本海默》中饰演 J·罗伯特·奥本海默" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Melinda Sue Gordon / Universal Pictures</figcaption></figure> <strong><em>This article containers spoilers for the film</em> Oppenheimer.</strong><br><br> Few authors have written as insightfully about the life of J. Robert Oppenheimer as Richard Rhodes, whose 1986 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-richard-rhodes/9781451677614?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em></a> , is widely regarded as the definitive account of the Manhattan Project. Rhodes&#39;s comprehensive history, which won a Pulitzer Prize, is both a massive work of scholarship—the main text alone runs nearly 800 pages—and a literary feat that he conceived as “the tragic epic of the twentieth century.” Over the years, according to Rhodes, it has been optioned many times, but no film or television version has ever been made. “It&#39;s quite obvious why,” Rhodes told me. “It&#39;s just too big a story.”<br><br> Over the weekend, along with millions of other moviegoers, Rhodes saw <em>Oppenheimer</em> , Christopher Nolan&#39;s three-hour biopic of the physicist known as the father of the atomic bomb. The next day, curious about his reaction, I spoke with Rhodes by phone. He was deeply impressed by the film, especially in light of earlier attempts to adapt the same material. “It&#39;s really first-class work,” Rhodes said, comparing it favorably with Roland Joffé&#39;s <em>Fat Man and Little Boy</em> (“badly done,” from a technological perspective) and specifically praising Cillian Murphy&#39;s performance in the title role. “If anything, he was a little too confident. But Oppenheimer was pretty confident.”<br><br> We also discussed aspects of the story that weren&#39;t covered by the film, which Nolan adapted from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/books-briefing-kai-bird/674785/">the biography <em>American Prometheus</em></a> , by Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin. Given its relentless concentration on Oppenheimer, the movie necessarily leaves a lot out, including plenty of what Rhodes called “drama on the industrial side” and the perspectives of scientists and victims who fall outside its protagonist&#39;s circle of consciousness. For the rest, viewers may need to return to Rhodes&#39;s own wide-ranging work, which expands beyond even the largest IMAX screen.<br><br><em>为了篇幅和清晰度，本次对话已被编辑。</em><br><br> <strong>Alec Nevala-Lee:</strong> Do you think that the film&#39;s picture of Oppenheimer is accurate?<br><br> <strong>Richard Rhodes:</strong> One time I asked [the physicist] Bob Serber if my portrait of Oppenheimer was anywhere close to the real human being. And Serber, who had a very dry wit, said, “It&#39;s the least wrong of all those I&#39;ve seen.”<br><br> And I think that applies here, because the difficult edges to Oppenheimer were, to some degree, sanded off. But there have been several Oppenheimers in past versions. The BBC did a series with Sam Waterston. He was wonderful, but he was much too nice. Then when the next version [the 2009 PBS docudrama <em>The Trials of J. Robert Oppenheimer</em> ] came around, [David Strathairn] played Oppenheimer as a hand-wringing neurotic, which really pissed me off when I watched it. You could not possibly have someone who did what Oppenheimer did in his life who was just sitting around shaking all the time with anxiety.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/">Read: <em>Oppenheimer</em> is more than a creation myth about the atomic bomb</a><br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Most viewers are probably encountering figures such as Lewis Strauss (the government official who orchestrated the notorious hearing that revoked Oppenheimer&#39;s security clearance, played by Robert Downey Jr. in a towering performance) and Leslie Groves (the military head of the atomic-weapons program, played by Matt Damon) for the first time.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> Yeah, I think Strauss, if anything, was depicted somewhat more pleasantly than he really was. I think he was even more nasty. And I was really surprised by Matt Damon, who did a damn good job. In fact, it gave me a different sort of perspective on Groves. I had pictured him as stuffier than he was depicted here, and I think this is probably closer to the truth. Groves was really a superb leader, and also anxious and insecure around the scientists. Which was a funny combination, because he drove them to get the job done anyway.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Was there anything else about the movie that surprised you?<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> Mostly minor things. I&#39;d read about the arrival of the shock wave after the light [from the Trinity test], but my God—when you see it in IMAX, it really hits you; it resonates in your chest. We were just knocked back in our chairs. I wish [Edward] Teller [Oppenheimer&#39;s nemesis in the debate over the hydrogen bomb] had been a little different. I spent an interesting 30 minutes with Teller and had some sense of what he was like. That guy [Benny Safdie] was a little too oily, not quite as sinister as Teller really was.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Nolan has always struck me as a pretty cerebral guy who also makes movies on the largest possible scale. It tracks to me that Oppenheimer, a theorist who found himself in charge of this incredible industrial operation, would appeal to him.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> That makes sense. My experience with writing books is, your best books are the ones that you have a deep emotional investment in. And there&#39;s an automatic tendency when you&#39;re writing a biography to turn the character in the biography into oneself.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Nolan, who is willing to play with structure, seems like a good choice for this story, because it allows him to deliver so much information. He can cut between the Manhattan Project period, the Oppenheimer hearing, and the hearing for Strauss&#39;s nomination as secretary of commerce, and use the dynamic to explain things to the audience.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> I had never thought about the parallel between Strauss and Oppenheimer before, but the story is structured so that both of them are destroyed by the forces of Washington, DC And that&#39;s really a wonderful sort of parallel. Oppenheimer&#39;s kind of a tragic hero, and I wouldn&#39;t give that credit to someone like Strauss. But in a kind of corrupt way, he followed the same arc across his life. That was a real insight that I haven&#39;t seen—maybe it&#39;s in the biography [ <em>American Prometheus</em> ].<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> I read it recently, and Strauss&#39;s hearing takes up just a single paragraph. But Nolan decides to make it a fifth of the movie, for the reasons you&#39;re saying. There&#39;s this fascinating parallel that is possible only in a movie—the thematic echoes and the rhythm of the editing provide a sense of closure that would be much more difficult in book form.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> You can do that, but you&#39;d have to have that insight. And Nolan had that insight. When you do research for a book, often you&#39;ll come across something that can be expanded upon. When I was working on <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> , I read a history of the development of physics in the United States. And in a footnote at the end of a chapter deep in the book, there&#39;s this note about [Enrico] Fermi, one day going up to the window and looking down at the gray winter length of Manhattan Island—alive with crowds—and cupping his hands together and saying, “A little bomb like that and it would all disappear.” The historian who wrote this book threw that away into a footnote. I made it the end of the whole first third of my book.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> The movie for the most part is very realistic, but dreamlike moments visualize Oppenheimer&#39;s psychological state, which reminded me of your book. The opening paragraph starts with the physicist Leo Szilard—whom you use in your book as a “clothesline” character, someone the audience can follow across a complex narrative—crossing the street, with a description of what the weather was like in London, and then it ends with a passage out of John Milton. And that elevates the tone in a way that tells you something about the material.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> That&#39;s what I was trying to do, of course. But I thought it was really off tone when [Nolan, in one of those dream sequences] had Oppenheimer and Jean Tatlock screwing on the table in the security hearing. That was, I think, maybe a bit of an overreach. It&#39;s curious and interesting that they decided not to visit Hiroshima.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> I was wondering whether Nolan would show that, but every scene that&#39;s not about Strauss is from Oppenheimer&#39;s point of view. So instead of the bombing, you see him waiting for a phone call, because he has no control over how the weapon is used. There&#39;s an earlier scene where the characters talk about saving lives by heading off an American invasion of Japan. Is this something that would have been discussed before the bombing, or is this a rationalization that defenders of the decision arrived at after the fact?<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> Well, George Marshall [the US Army chief of staff during World War II] said we knew that the Japanese were getting their people trained to fight us. And we thought that if we could bomb the beaches with atomic bombs, we might shock the Japanese into surrender. In fact, there were plans to keep going. I found a memorandum from Oppenheimer to Groves saying if we make a design that uses both plutonium and uranium, we can have six bombs a month by October.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> If the movie had included that suggestion, it would have really changed the viewer&#39;s sense of Oppenheimer.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> There was also discussion in &#39;43 or &#39;44 of making radiation bombs stuffed with cobalt 60 or something that would just spread radioactive particles all over the place. We did some tests down in New Mexico, and I remember someone&#39;s comment afterward—it was the most god-awful stuff you could imagine. Which, yes, it would be, wouldn&#39;t it?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/richard-rhodes-making-of-the-atomic-bomb-ai/674777/">Read: The real lesson from <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em></a><br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> I recently watched the opera <em>Doctor Atomic</em> , where one character is Oppenheimer&#39;s Native American maid. That&#39;s the kind of voice you don&#39;t hear in the movie.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> It was certainly a valid perspective. These guys came in and swept the mesa clean, and they used the Native American people to clean their houses.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> Nolan is so focused on Oppenheimer—but with a movie like this, you have to find, as you&#39;ve said, the clothesline.<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> And there was so much drama on the industrial side that&#39;s basically just left out. It&#39;s compressed into something that is really very brilliant—those big open jars in which they keep dropping marbles [to track the supply of uranium and plutonium]. That&#39;s as close as we come to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/05/the-60-year-downfall-of-nuclear-power-in-the-us-has-left-a-huge-mess/560945/">seeing the Hanford complex</a> , with its huge production reactors, or the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-was-once-the-worlds-largest-building-has-now-been-completely-demolished/282549/">Oak Ridge complex</a> , with one factory that was [about] a mile long, so the supervisors inside rode around on bicycles.<br><br> <strong>Nevala-Lee:</strong> How do you feel about the impact this movie will have on how a mass audience understands this immensely complicated story?<br><br> <strong>Rhodes:</strong> I&#39;ve been living with this story now for 40, 50 years. So what I&#39;m most excited by—you will consider this crass, but this is where I am in my life—is we&#39;ve got an option from a German company for <em>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</em> to be made into a multipart television series. And I&#39;m just hoping that this will cause enough stir that these people will finally, for the first time in all these years, actually pick up the option. That would be just wonderful, and I&#39;d pay off my mortgage, and my version of the story would be out there.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 13:11:08 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-richard-rhodes-interview/674828/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-richard-rhodes-interview/674828/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Israel Has Already Lost]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Israel hasn&#39;t destroyed its democracy yet.

But the reprieve was only temporary. At the time, the far-right ministers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/27/netanyahu-israeli-judicial-overhaul-suspend-protests">Itamar Ben-Gvir</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-says-hes-delaying-overhaul-to-allow-dialogue-but-vows-reform-will-happen/">Bezalel Smotrich</a> assured supporters that the reforms would pass by late July.<br><br> This did not happen. Instead, on Monday, in the final week of the Israeli Parliament&#39;s summer session, the ruling coalition passed the least significant component of its proposed legislation: curtailing the Supreme Court&#39;s ability to use the “reasonableness standard” when reviewing government decisions. Contrary to the far right&#39;s pledge, the government did not enact its plan to subordinate the appointment of Supreme Court judges to politicians. Nor did it grant the coalition the ability to override judicial decisions.<br><br> In other words, Israel&#39;s democracy—flawed as it is—remains intact, for now. Far from incapacitated, the country&#39;s highest court is already <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/high-court-justices-rush-back-from-abroad-to-hear-petitions-against-reasonableness/">rushing</a> to convene an unprecedented session to rule on the legality of this week&#39;s effort to curb its powers. But whether or not Israel erodes its democratic guardrails in the months ahead, its people have already lost something similarly essential: basic social trust.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/israel-protests-netanyahu-judicial-systems-overhaul/673623/">Yair Rosenberg: The three biggest misconceptions about Israel&#39;s upheaval</a><br><br> Israel&#39;s warring camps are ostensibly fighting over the reasonableness doctrine, a technical tool inherited from British common law that allows the country&#39;s high court to overrule certain government decisions, though not legislation. But fundamentally, this debate is not about the law itself, which few Israelis could easily explain. It is about whose judgment is trusted to safeguard the country&#39;s democracy.<br><br> Put crudely, the reasonableness doctrine is a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/the-reason-for-reasonableness-a-doctrine-at-the-heart-of-the-overhaul-explained/">subjective standard</a> that has allowed Israel&#39;s justices to substitute their own considerations for the legislature&#39;s when assessing the merits of certain government actions and civil-service appointments. Given that the members of Israel&#39;s Supreme Court are appointed by a panel composed mostly of other judges and lawyers, a credible case exists for restraining this capacity, which lacks democratic accountability.<br><br> But this week&#39;s reform did not take place in a vacuum. It took place in the context of a power grab by the most hard-right government in Israeli history—one that received only <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://votes25.bechirot.gov.il/">48.4 percent</a> of the vote in the last election. If Israel&#39;s judges no longer get to decide which administrative decisions are “reasonable,” that means that the politicians in power do, even if they, too, lack a mandate. And today, those politicians include <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/maoz-set-to-rejoin-government-resume-role-as-jewish-identity-czar/">homophobes</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel/ben-gvir-convicted-of-inciting-to-racism">convicted</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-728898">criminals</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-elections/analysis-why-is-religious-zionist-politician-dreaming-of-galactic-state-597867">aspiring theocrats</a> , and proud <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/i-made-mistakes-ben-gvir-tells-high-court-hes-refined-since-entering-politics/">nationalist</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-should-wipe-out-palestinian-town-of-huwara-says-senior-minister-smotrich/">chauvinists</a> .<br><br> Polls <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-only-1-in-4-israelis-wants-government-to-press-ahead-with-judicial-overhaul/">consistently</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/AnshelPfeffer/status/1683912208307085321">show</a> that two-thirds of Israel&#39;s citizens oppose the ruling coalition&#39;s unilateral overhaul of the judiciary. Put another way, most Israelis simply do not trust the intentions of their own government. They do not believe that Netanyahu, let alone <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/12/israel-election-bibi-netanyahu-ben-gvir/672572/">the extremist allies he depends upon</a> to maintain his power, will be more reasonable than the unelected Supreme Court. And they do not believe that the coalition will stop with this small salvo against the judiciary when it has already announced its intentions to deconstruct the entire edifice. The Israeli opposition has lost faith in its countrymen to act in the best interest of the entire nation, which is why its leaders now <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/GLZRadio/status/1683697314509082625">openly accuse</a> the government of seeking to destroy democracy.<br><br> This rancor extends well beyond the usual partisan politics, and it runs both ways. Rather than attempting to calm the waters and reestablish civic trust, Netanyahu&#39;s far-right ministers have rubbed their recent victory in the opposition&#39;s face and promised more of the same. “The salad bar is open,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-752065">crowed</a> Ben-Gvir on Saturday night, framing the impending reasonableness reform as merely the appetizer for a much more forbidding buffet. A cannier, more responsible politician would mouth platitudes about how <i>This is a difficult time for Israel, but we are all patriots who want the best for one another and the country.</i> Ben-Gvir does not believe that—and rarely feels compelled to pretend that he does. Instead, he and his allies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/us-envoy-nides-says-claims-that-us-is-funding-protests-in-israel-are-absurd/">have</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/itamarbengvir/status/1683706154986135552">cast</a> the hundreds of thousands of anti-overhaul street protesters as “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-03-10/ty-article-magazine/.premium/why-netanyahu-slurs-israels-pro-democracy-protesters-as-anarchists/00000186-c637-d069-a3df-c63ffad90000">privileged anarchists</a> ” and foreign-funded enemies, rather than fellow citizens expressing genuine concern.

In the days ahead, Israel&#39;s Supreme Court may overturn this first strike against its authority, something it has never done before to a quasi-constitutional “basic law” of this kind. The justices may let the legislation stand but interpret it into irrelevance, coming up with new legal ways to get to the same results that the reasonableness doctrine previously provided. Or the Court may punt entirely, deciding that it lacks the power to overrule such a parliamentary prerogative.<br><br> If the Court does undo this decision, it may stall the overhaul, throwing the coalition into chaos and recrimination. Or the reversal may galvanize the far-right&#39;s efforts to pass its entire anti-judicial package, by affirming its belief that small-scale changes will never be enough to change the Court&#39;s jurisprudence. There is a reason, after all, that the right&#39;s original plan included many more components than what has been passed: Removing reasonableness from the judicial toolbox still leaves the rest of the tools, not to mention those who wield them.<br><br> In the long run, the current coalition may use further legislation to cement its power, quash the courts, and marginalize its opposition.

First, she needs to build up her energy by lying in a dark room for the better part of two days, doing little more than listening to audiobooks. Then she needs a driver, a quiet destination where she can lie down, and days of rest to recover afterward. The brief outdoor joy “never quite feels like enough,” she told me, but it&#39;s so much more than what she managed in her first year of long COVID, when she couldn&#39;t sit upright for more than an hour or stand for more than 10 minutes. Now, at least, she can watch TV on the same day she takes a shower.<br><br> In her previous life, she pulled all-nighters in graduate school and rough shifts at her hospital as an occupational therapist; she went for long runs and sagged after long flights. None of that compares with what she has endured since getting COVID-19 almost three years ago. The fatigue she now feels is “like a complete depletion of the essence of who you are, of your life force,” she told me in an email.<br><br> Fatigue is among <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00299-6/fulltext#seccesectitle0027">the most</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2805540">common</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/13/6/e069217">most</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9383197/">disabling</a> of long COVID&#39;s symptoms, and a signature of similar chronic illnesses such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://batemanhornecenter.org/education/me-cfs/">myalgic encephalomyelitis</a> (also known as chronic fatigue syndrome or ME/CFS). But in these diseases, fatigue is so distinct from everyday weariness that most of the people I have talked with were unprepared for how severe, multifaceted, and persistent it can be.<br><br> For a start, this fatigue isn&#39;t really a single symptom; it <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4852700/">has many faces</a> . It can weigh the body down: Lisa Geiszler likens it to “wearing a lead exoskeleton on a planet with extremely high gravity, while being riddled with severe arthritis.” It can rev the body up: Many fatigued people feel “wired and tired,” paradoxically in fight-or-flight mode despite being utterly depleted. It can be cognitive: Thoughts become sluggish, incoherent, and sometimes painful—like “there&#39;s steel wool stuck in my frontal lobe,” Gwynn Dujardin, a literary historian with ME, told me.<br><br> Fatigue turns the most mundane of tasks into an “agonizing cost-benefit analysis,” Misko said. If you do laundry, how long will you need to rest to later make a meal? If you drink water, will you be able to reach the toilet? Only a quarter of long-haulers have symptoms that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/covid19/pulse/long-covid.htm">severely limit their daily activities</a> , but even those with “moderate” cases are profoundly limited. Julia Moore Vogel, a program director at Scripps Research, still works, but washing her hair, she told me, leaves her as exhausted as the long-distance runs she used to do.<br><br> And though normal fatigue is temporary and amenable to agency—even after a marathon, you can will yourself into a shower, and you&#39;ll feel better after sleeping—rest often fails to cure the fatigue of long COVID or ME/CFS. “I wake up fatigued,” Letícia Soares, who has long COVID, told me.<br><br> Between long COVID, ME/CFS, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://chronicillnessinclusion.org.uk/2021/04/28/what-are-energy-impairment-and-elci/">other energy-limiting chronic illnesses</a> , millions of people in the US alone experience debilitating fatigue. But American society tends to equate inactivity with immorality, and productivity with worth. Faced with a condition that simply doesn&#39;t allow people to move—even one whose deficits can be measured and explained—many doctors and loved ones default to disbelief. When Soares tells others about her illness, they usually say, “Oh yeah, I&#39;m tired too.” When she was bedbound for days, people told her, “I need a weekend like that.” Soares&#39;s problems are very real, and although researchers have started to figure out why so many people like her are suffering, they don&#39;t yet know how to stop it.<br><br> Fatigue creates a background hum of disability, but it can be punctuated by worse percussive episodes that strip long-haulers of even the small amounts of energy they normally have.<br><br> Daria Oller is a physiotherapist and athletic trainer, so when she got COVID in March 2020, she naturally tried exercising her way to better health. And she couldn&#39;t understand why, after just short runs, her fatigue, brain fog, chest pain, and other symptoms would flare up dramatically—to the point where she could barely move or speak. These crashes contradicted everything she had learned during her training. Only after talking with physiotherapists with ME/CFS did she realize that this phenomenon has a name: <em>post-exertional malaise</em> .<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Post-exertional_malaise">Post-exertional malaise</a> , or PEM, is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(21)00513-9/fulltext#secsectitle0030">the defining trait of ME/CFS</a> and a common feature of long COVID. It is often portrayed as an extreme form of fatigue, but it is more correctly understood as a physiological state in which <em>all</em> existing symptoms burn more fiercely and new ones ignite. Beyond fatigue, people who get PEM might also feel intense radiant pain, an inflammatory burning feeling, or gastrointestinal and cognitive problems: “You feel poisoned, flu-ish, concussed,” Misko said. And where fatigue usually sets in right after exertion, PEM might strike hours or days later, and with disproportionate ferocity. Even gentle physical or mental effort might lay people out for days, weeks, months. Visiting a doctor can precipitate a crash, and so can filling out applications for disability benefits—or sensing bright lights and loud sounds, regulating body temperature on hot days, or coping with stress. And if in fatigue your batteries feel drained, in PEM they&#39;re missing entirely. It&#39;s the annihilation of possibility: Most people experience the desperation of being unable to move only in nightmares, Dujardin told me. “PEM is like that, but much more painful.”<br><br> Medical professionals generally don&#39;t learn about PEM during their training. Many people doubt its existence because it is so unlike anything that healthy people endure. Mary Dimmock told me that she understood what it meant only when she saw her son, Matthew, who has ME/CFS, crash in front of her eyes. “He just <em>melted</em> ,” Dimmock said. But most people never see such damage because PEM hides those in the midst of it from public view. And because it usually occurs after a delay, people who experience PEM might appear well to friends and colleagues who then don&#39;t witness the exorbitant price they later pay.<br><br> That price is both real and measurable. In cardiopulmonary exercise tests, or CPETs, patients use treadmills or exercise bikes while doctors record their oxygen consumption, blood pressure, and heart rate. Betsy Keller, an exercise physiologist at Ithaca College, told me that most people can repeat their performance if retested one day later, even if they have heart disease or are deconditioned by inactivity. People who get PEM cannot. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4004422/">Their results are so different the second time around</a> that when Keller first tested someone with ME/CFS in 2003, “I told my colleagues that our equipment was out of calibration,” she said. But she and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://content.iospress.com/articles/work/wor203170">others</a> have seen the same pattern in hundreds of ME/CFS and long-COVID patients—“objective findings that can&#39;t be explained by anything psychological,” David Systrom, a pulmonologist at Brigham and Women&#39;s Hospital, told me. “Many patients are told it&#39;s all in their head, but this belies that in spades.” Still, many insurers refuse to pay for a second test, and many patients cannot do two CPETs (or even one) without seriously risking their health. And “20 years later, I still have physicians who refute and ignore the objective data,” Keller said. (Some long-COVID studies have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/full/10.7326/M22-1492">ignored PEM entirely</a> , or bundled it together with fatigue.)<br><br> Oller thinks this dismissal arises because PEM inverts the dogma that exercise is good for you—an adage that, for most other illnesses, is correct. “It&#39;s not easy to change what you&#39;ve been doing your whole career, even when I tell someone that they might be harming their patients,” she said. Indeed, many long-haulers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/19/9/5093">get worse</a> because they <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0264331">don&#39;t get enough rest</a> in their first weeks of illness, or try to exercise through their symptoms on doctors&#39; orders.<br><br> People with PEM are also frequently misdiagnosed. They&#39;re told that they&#39;re deconditioned from being too sedentary, when their inactivity is the result of frequent crashes, not the cause. They&#39;re told that they&#39;re depressed and unmotivated, when they are usually desperate to move and either physically incapable of doing so or using restraint to avoid crashing. Oller is part of a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/longcovidsupportforenduranceathletes/">support group</a> of 1,500 endurance athletes with long COVID who are well used to running, swimming, and biking through pain and tiredness. “Why would we all just <em>stop</em> ?”她问。<br><br> Some patients with energy-limiting illnesses argue that the names of their diseases and symptoms make them easier to discredit. <em>Fatigue</em> invites people to minimize severe depletion as everyday tiredness. <em>Chronic fatigue syndrome</em> collapses a wide-ranging disabling condition into a single symptom that is easy to trivialize. These complaints are valid, but the problem runs deeper than any name.<br><br> Dujardin, the English professor who is (very slowly) writing a cultural history of fatigue, thinks that our concept of it has been impoverished by centuries of reductionism. As the study of medicine slowly fractured into anatomical specialties, it lost an overarching sense of the systems that contribute to human energy, or its absence. The concept of energy was (and still is) central to animistic philosophies, and though once core to the Western world, too, it is now culturally associated with quackery and pseudoscience. “There are vials of &#39;energy boosters&#39; by every cash register in the US,” Dujardin said, but when the NIH convened a conference on <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/about/events/beyond-symptom-biology-fatigue">the biology of fatigue</a> in 2021, “specialists kept observing that no standard definition exists for fatigue, and everyone was working from different ideas of human energy.” These terms have become so unhelpfully unspecific that our concept of “fatigue” can encompass a wide array of states including PEM and idleness, and can be heavily influenced by social forces—in particular the desire to exploit the energy of others.<br><br> As the historian Emily K. Abel notes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/sick-and-tired-an-intimate-history-of-fatigue-emily-k-abel/9781469663340?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Sick and Tired: An Intimate History of Fatigue</em></a> , many studies of everyday fatigue at the turn of the 20th century focused on the weariness of manual laborers, and were done to find ways to make those workers more productive. During this period, fatigue was recast from a physiological limit that employers must work around into a psychological failure that individuals must work against. “Present-day society stigmatizes those who don&#39;t <em>Push through</em> ; <em>keep at it</em> ; <em>show grit</em> ,” Dujardin said, and for the sin of subverting those norms, long-haulers “are not just disbelieved but treated openly with contempt.” Fatigue is “profoundly anti-capitalistic,” Jaime Seltzer, the director of scientific and medical outreach at the advocacy group MEAction, told me.<br><br> Energy-limiting illnesses also disproportionately affect women, who have long been portrayed as prone to idleness. Dujardin notes that in Western epics, women such as Circe and Dido were perceived harshly for averting questing heroes such as Odysseus and Aeneas with the temptation of rest. Later, the onset of industrialization turned women instead into emblems of homebound idleness while men labored in public. As shirking work became a moral failure, it also remained a feminine one.<br><br> These attitudes were evident in the ways two successive US presidents dealt with COVID. Donald Trump, who always evinced a caricature of masculine strength and chastised rivals for being “low energy,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2020/10/trump-strength-coronavirus/616682/">framed his recovery from the coronavirus as an act of domination</a> . Joe Biden was less bombastic, but he still conspicuously <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1553451657748512768">assured the public</a> that he was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-tests-positive-covid-will-continue-work-white-house-2022-07-21/">working through his COVID infection</a> while his administration prioritized policies that got people <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-coronavirus-pandemic-health-emergency-management-federal-emergency-management-agency-20f1e637f03f400376e7381df5ccdb51">back to work</a> . Neither man spoke of the possibility of disabling fatigue or the need for rest.<br><br> Medicine, too, absorbs society&#39;s stigmas around fatigue, even in selecting those who get to join its ranks. Its famously grueling training programs exclude (among others) most people with energy-limiting illnesses, while valorizing the ability to function when severely depleted. This, together with the tendency to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/interactive/2022/women-pain-gender-bias-doctors/">psychologize women&#39;s pain</a> , helps to explain why so many long-haulers— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/health-care-workers-long-covid-are-being-dismissed/620801/">even those with medical qualifications</a> , like Misko and Oller—are treated so badly by the professionals they see for care. When Dujardin first sought medical help for her ME/CFS symptoms, the same doctor who had treated her well for a decade suddenly became stiff and suspicious, she told me, reduced all of her detailed descriptions to “tiredness,” and left the room without offering diagnosis or treatment. There is so much cultural pressure to <em>never stop</em> that many people can&#39;t accept that their patients or peers might be biologically forced to do so.<br><br> No grand unified theory explains everything about long COVID and ME/CFS, but <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41579-022-00846-2">neither are</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(21)00513-9/fulltext#secsectitle0030">these diseases total mysteries</a> . In fact, plenty of evidence exists for at least two pathways that explain why people with these conditions could be so limited in energy.<br><br> First, most people with energy-limiting chronic illnesses have problems with their autonomic nervous system, which governs heartbeat, breathing, sleep, hormone release, and other bodily functions that we don&#39;t consciously control. When <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9639503/">this system</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/qjmed/article/100/8/519/1521818">is disrupted</a> —a condition called “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=34">dysautonomia</a> ”—hormones such as adrenaline might be released at inappropriate moments, leading to the wired-but-tired feeling. People might suddenly feel sleepy, as if they&#39;re shutting down. Blood vessels might not expand in moments of need, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2021/11/19/heart-failure-muscles-long-covid-chronic-fatigue/">depriving active muscles and organs of oxygen and fuel</a> ; those organs might include the brain, leading to cognitive dysfunction such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/long-covid-brain-fog-symptom-executive-function/671393/">brain fog</a> .<br><br> Second, many people with long COVID and ME/CFS have problems with generating energy. When viruses invade the body, the immune system counterattacks, triggering a state of inflammation. Both infection and inflammation can <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36355108/">damage</a> the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32327453/">mitochondria</a> —the bean-shaped batteries that power our cells. Malfunctioning mitochondria produce <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8403932/">violent chemicals called “reactive oxygen species” (ROS)</a> that inflict even more cellular damage. Inflammation <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ij.hapres.com/htmls/IJ_1341_Detail.html">also triggers a metabolic switch</a> toward fast but inefficient ways of making energy, depleting cells of fuel and riddling them with lactic acid. These changes collectively explain the pervasive, dead-battery flavor of fatigue, as “the body struggles to generate energy,” Bindu Paul, a pharmacologist and neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins, told me. They might also explain the burning, poisoned feelings that patients experience, as their cells fill with lactic acid and ROS.<br><br> These two pathways—autonomic and metabolic—might also account for PEM. Normally, the autonomic nervous system smoothly dials up to an intense fight-and-flight mode and down to a calmer rest-and-digest one. But “in dysautonomia, the dial becomes a switch,” David Putrino, a neuroscientist and rehabilitation specialist at Mount Sinai, told me. “You go from sitting to standing and your body thinks: <em>Oh, are we going hunting</em> ? You stop, and your body shuts down.” The exhaustion of these dramatic, unstable flip-flops is made worse by the ongoing metabolic maelstrom. Damaged mitochondria, destructive ROS, inefficient metabolism, and chronic inflammation all compound one another in a vicious cycle that, if it becomes sufficiently intense, could manifest as a PEM crash. “No one is absolutely certain about what causes PEM,” Seltzer told me, but it makes sense that “you have this big metabolic shift and your nervous system can&#39;t get back on an even keel.” And if people push through, deepening the metabolic demands on a body that already can&#39;t meet them, the cycle can spin even faster, “leading to progressive disability,” Putrino said.<br><br> Other factors might also be at play. Compared with healthy people, those with long COVID and ME/CFS have differences in the size, structure, or function of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(23)00051-2/fulltext">brain</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4032274/">regions</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.healthrising.org/blog/2018/12/12/death-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-me-cfs-autopsy-files/">including</a> the thalamus, which relays motor signals and regulates consciousness, and the basal ganglia, which controls movement and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/srep21386#:~:text=Hence%2C%20dysfunctions%20of%20the%20basal,thalamic%E2%80%93frontal%20cortical%20system8.">has been implicated in fatigue</a> . Long-haulers also have problems with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8938726/">blood vessels</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34087216/">red blood cells</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-02286-7">clotting</a> , all of which might further staunch their flows of blood, oxygen, and nutrients. “I&#39;ve tested so many of these people over the years, and we see over and over again that when the systems start to fail, they all fail in the same way,” Keller said. Together, these woes explain why long COVID and ME/CFS have such bewilderingly varied symptoms. That diversity fuels disbelief— <em>how</em> <em>could one disease cause all of this</em> ?—but it&#39;s exactly what you&#39;d expect if things as fundamental as metabolism go awry.<br><br> Long-haulers might not know the biochemical specifics of their symptoms, but they are uncannily good at capturing those underpinnings through metaphor. People experiencing autonomic blood-flow problems might complain about feeling “drained,” and that&#39;s literally happening: In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.dysautonomiainternational.org/page.php?ID=30">POTS</a> , a form of dysautonomia, blood pools in the lower body when people stand. People experiencing metabolic problems often use dead-battery analogies, and indeed their cellular batteries—the mitochondria—are being damaged: “It really feels like something is going wrong at the cellular level,” Oller told me. Attentive doctors can find important clues about the basis of their patients&#39; illness hiding amid descriptions that are often billed as “exaggerated or melodramatic,” Dujardin said.<br><br> Some COVID long-haulers do recover. But several studies have found that, so far, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4505315">most don&#39;t</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-29513-z">fully return</a> to their previous baseline, and many who become severely ill stay that way. This pool of persistently sick people is now mired in the same neglect that has long plagued those who suffer from illnesses such as ME/CFS. Research into such conditions are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32568148/">grossly underfunded</a> , so no cures exist. Very few doctors in the US <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/09/mecfs-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-doctors-long-covid/671518/">know how to treat these conditions</a> , and many are nearing retirement, so patients struggle to find care. Long-COVID clinics exist but vary in quality: Some know nothing about other energy-limiting illnesses, and still prescribe potentially harmful and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.statnews.com/2017/09/25/chronic-fatigue-syndrome-cdc/">officially discouraged treatments</a> such as exercise. Clinicians who better understand these illnesses know that caution is crucial. When Putrino works with long-haulers to recondition their autonomic nervous system, he always starts as gently as possible to avoid triggering PEM. Such work “isn&#39;t easy and isn&#39;t fast,” he said, and it usually means stabilizing people instead of curing them.<br><br> Stability can be life-changing, especially when it involves changes that patients can keep up at home. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37432282/">Over-the-counter supplements</a> such as coenzyme Q10, which is used by mitochondria to generate energy and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20010505/">is depleted in ME/CFS patients</a> , can <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25386668/">reduce fatigue</a> . Anti-inflammatory medications such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Low_dose_naltrexone">low-dose naltrexone</a> may have some promise. Sleep hygiene may not cure fatigue, but certainly makes it less debilitating. Dietary changes can help, but the right ones might be counterintuitive: High-fiber foods take more energy to digest, and some long-haulers get PEM episodes after eating meals that <em>seem</em> healthy. And the most important part of this portfolio is “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Pacing#The_principles_of_pacing">pacing</a> ”—a strategy for carefully keeping your activity levels beneath the threshold that causes debilitating crashes.<br><br> Pacing is more challenging than it sounds. Practitioners can&#39;t rely on fixed routines; instead, they must learn to gauge their fluctuating energy levels in real time, while becoming acutely aware of their PEM triggers. Some turn to wearable technology such as heart-rate monitors, and more than 30,000 are testing a patient-designed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.makevisible.com/blog/why-we-are-building-visible">app called Visible</a> to help spot patterns in their illness. Such data are useful, but the difference between rest and PEM might be just 10 or 20 extra heartbeats a minute—a narrow crevice into which long-haulers must squeeze their life. Doing so can be frustrating, because pacing isn&#39;t a recovery tactic; it&#39;s mostly a way of not getting worse, which makes its value harder to appreciate. Its physical benefits come at mental costs: Walks, workouts, socializing, and “all the things I&#39;d do for mental health before were huge energy sinks,” Vogel told me. And without financial stability or social support, many long-haulers must work, parent, and care for themselves even knowing that they&#39;ll suffer later. “It&#39;s impossible not to overdo it, because life is life,” Vogel said.<br><br> “Our society is not set up for pacing,” Oller added. Long-haulers must resist the enormous cultural pressure to prove their worth by pushing as hard as they can. They must tolerate being chastised for trying to avert a crash, and being disbelieved if they fail. “One of the most insulting things people can say is &#39;Fight your illness,&#39;” Misko said. That would be much easier for her. “It takes so much self-control and strength to do less, to be less, to shrink your life down to one or two small things from which you try to extract joy in order to survive.” For her and many others, rest has become both a medical necessity and a radical act of defiance—one that, in itself, is exhausting.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/chronic-fatigue-long-covid-symptoms/674834/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/chronic-fatigue-long-covid-symptoms/674834/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[I Saw the Movie ‘They’ Don't Want You to See]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> <em>Sound of Freedom</em> and the limits of culture-war marketing <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/JrFd-R5t31H61bbzpeaMBGHfZ2Q=/0x0:1920x1080/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/song_of_freedom/original.jpg" alt="仍来自《自由之声》" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Angel Studios</figcaption></figure> The movie that I, like a million other women, really wanted to see this weekend was <i>Barbie</i> . A celebration of friendship! Of girlhood! Of the color pink! But my editor had a different idea: Would I go see that movie about child sex trafficking? The one that a lot of people online are angry about?<br><br> “Uh, sure,” I replied. I am a team player.<br><br> When I arrived at the Tysons Corner AMC in McLean, Virginia, on Sunday, the lobby was filled with people wearing fuchsia body-con dresses, blond wigs, and thigh-high boots. None of these happy moviegoers, however, was heading in the same direction as I was. Instead, my theater contained a few dozen somber-looking people who had elected to see a $15 Sunday-afternoon screening of one of the most disturbing films of the year.<br><br> <i>Sound of Freedom</i> , which came out on the Fourth of July, follows a man named Tim Ballard, who quits his job at the Department of Homeland Security to personally rescue two Honduran children from a sex-trafficking ring in Colombia. Ballard is a real person with “extreme biceps, extreme blue eyes, and extreme bleach-blond hair,” as my colleague Kaitlyn Tiffany <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/children-sex-trafficking-conspiracy-epidemic/620845/">wrote</a> in 2021. He really did start an organization that conducts sting operations to free people from traffickers. But according to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7a3qw/a-famed-anti-sex-trafficking-group-has-a-problem-with-the-truth">one journalistic investigation</a> by <i>Vice</i> , his nonprofit, Operation Underground Railroad, has exaggerated the details of some of its international rescues as well as its role in domestic law enforcement.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/01/children-sex-trafficking-conspiracy-epidemic/620845/">Read: The great (fake) child-sex-trafficking epidemic</a><br><br> <i>Sound of Freedom</i> was attracting controversy long before its release. Finished in early 2018, the film was bought by Fox, and then when Disney acquired Fox it immediately shelved the film. Right away, that gave the movie a kind of forbidden, subversive<i> </i>appeal. Eventually, the distribution rights were sold to Angel Studios, a company in Utah that produced the Christian historical drama <i>The Chosen</i> . Since <i>Sound of Freedom</i> started showing in theaters, some viewers have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2023/07/20/false-claim-amc-shut-off-ac-for-sound-of-freedom-fact-check/70431071007/">alleged instances</a> of sabotage intended to prevent them from seeing the film. This week, <i>Sound of Freedom</i> broke <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jul/23/sound-of-freedom-qanon-movie-conspiracy-theories">$100 million</a> in revenue. Last week, former President Donald Trump held a screening at his golf club in New Jersey, where, channeling Paris Hilton, he called it “the hottest movie anywhere in the world.” On Tuesday night, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy held a screening of the movie for members of Congress.<br><br> The film&#39;s critics argue that the movie exaggerates the prevalence of child exploitation in a way that helps advance <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">QAnon conspiracy theories</a> about a satanic ruling elite that molests children and feasts on their blood. But the movie&#39;s fans say, <i>This is the film the Democratic elite doesn&#39;t want you to see!</i><br><br> <i>Sound of Freedom</i> is neither of these things. It&#39;s fine—not great but not terrible, either. It doesn&#39;t make any reference to “deep state” bloodsucking or congressional sex cabals. It&#39;s a straightforward, if plodding, action movie about a man on a righteous quest—with zero character development and way too many close-ups of people either crying or smoking cigars.<br><br> Although the movie doesn&#39;t depict anything particularly graphic, the subject of child abuse is still difficult to watch dramatized on the big screen. It was upsetting. But so was talking about it afterward with other audience members, many of whom seemed convinced that some significant number of their countrymen condone child trafficking. <i>Sound of Freedom</i> , in other words, is just the latest flash point in an apparently endless culture war that encourages Americans to believe the absolute worst about one another.<br><br> In the movie, Ballard is played by Jim Caviezel, who also starred as Jesus in 2004&#39;s <i>The</i> <i>Passion of the Christ</i> , and has himself dabbled in the dark whimsy of Q. In 2021, he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/07/sound-of-freedom-qanon-theories-jim-caviezel/">spoke</a> at a right-wing conference in Oklahoma, where he warned attendees about “the adrenochrome-ing of children,” an absurd <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-qanon-became-obsessed-with-adrenochrome-an-imaginary-drug-hollywood-is-harvesting-from-kids">theory</a> that says global elites are using a chemical harvested from kidnapped children to keep them looking spry. At one point in the movie, asked why he was so determined to rescue the kids, Caviezel&#39;s character pauses, and his eyes well up with tears. “God&#39;s children aren&#39;t for sale,” he says. My theater broke into applause and shouts of “Amen!”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/06/qanon-nothing-can-stop-what-is-coming/610567/">From the June 2020 issue: The prophecies of Q</a><br><br> The movie has united religious conservatives and Trump supporters, as well as a small sampling of the chronically paranoid—or at least it appeared to have done so at my showing. (I chose this particular theater because, when I looked online, a lot of people had bought tickets—probably because McLean has more right-leaning voters than many other places in the Washington, DC, area.)<br><br> Kate Cox, a retiree from McLean wearing little flower earrings, told me before the movie that she was “a pro-life Catholic” concerned about the border. “That&#39;s exactly what this is about,” she said. “They&#39;re taking these people and selling them into sex slavery.” Cox and her girlfriends were also worried about the fentanyl coming in from Mexico: <i>How hard would it be to put up a wall?</i><br><br> “And the homelessness!” added Peggy, a friend of Cox&#39;s who declined to share her last name. “Cities are falling apart.” Cox nodded. “Say what you will about Trump, and 99 percent of it&#39;s true,” she said, “but this didn&#39;t happen under Trump.”<br><br> Unlike <i>Barbie</i> , with its huge marketing budget and corporate partnerships, word of mouth seems to be the main attendance-driver for <i>Sound of Freedom</i> : Most of the people I spoke with on Sunday had bought a ticket on a loved one&#39;s recommendation.<br><br> “One of my friends told me to see this movie,” Nicole Gutierrez, a Swiss native who lives in DC, told me. “This is a much bigger business than we think it is. Hollywood, politicians—they&#39;re all involved.” She pulled out her phone to show me a text that her friend had sent a few minutes earlier. “Maybe you know what it means.” Her friend had sent the letter <i>C</i> , followed by an eye emoji, followed by the letter <i>A</i> . “I think he means the CIA,” I said. Gutierrez raised her eyebrows. “Everybody&#39;s involved,” she said. “The White House, of course.”<br><br> In a bonus clip after the credits, Caviezel encourages viewers in a whispery voice to scan a QR code and buy a ticket for someone who can&#39;t afford it. “We can make <i>Sound of Freedom</i> the <i>Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin</i> of 21st-century slavery,” he says, likening the film to the novel that helped inspire the 19th-century abolitionist movement. After that, as the lights came up, a woman in my row who introduced herself as Cheska stood up to announce that she was there to talk about her 23-year-old daughter, who had been missing for a year and a half. “I&#39;m expecting a miracle,” she said. “She&#39;s going to be returned soon.” Warning that the End Times were upon us, Cheska asked us to pray for her and for one another. A few people again said, “Amen,” and at least one woman gave her a hug.<br><br> As I left the theater, I approached another group of friends to hear what they thought. They all declined to share their last names, but were happy to tell me how powerful they&#39;d found the movie. “Men want to protect people,” a dark-haired middle-aged man named George said, “so it&#39;s embarrassing that there&#39;s anyone out there that would ever do that to a child.” He brought up the new Jason Aldean song, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/music-news/jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-streams-up-controversy-1235543896/">Try That in a Small Town</a> ,” in which the country artist promises vigilante justice. “I like that song that no one wants to talk about,” George said. Real men would beat up a child abuser.<br><br> “You realize you&#39;re talking to some of the few conservatives in the area?” George&#39;s bearded friend Steven asked me, with a wink. “You know what surprises me,” he went on, “is why the left hates this movie. I don&#39;t get it.” He looked at me as though he expected an answer.<br><br> If people on the left are repelled by this movie, it&#39;s for the same reasons people on the right feel so obligated to see it. Our political leaders, our social circles, and our chosen media have signaled in our echo chambers exactly how we should feel about it—and so much else, besides. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/rise-and-fall-bud-light-boycott/674752/">Bud Light</a> . <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/01/21/1150397853/gas-stoves-became-part-of-the-culture-war-in-less-than-a-week-heres-why">Gas stoves</a> . <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/book-bans-censorship-librarian-challenges/673398/">School libraries</a> . <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/target-pride-lgbtq-4bc9de6339f86748bcb8a453d7b9acf0">The Target Pride section</a> . <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/elon-musk-ron-desantis-2024-twitter/674149/">Elon Musk&#39;s Twitter</a> . <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/why-is-tracy-chapman-at-the-center-of-a-country-music-controversy/674794/">Luke Combs&#39;s “Fast Car.”</a> The entire <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/disney-florida-desantis.html">Walt Disney Company</a> .

You might choose from a number of models. For example, Instagram Adventure, in which you pick an exotic destination, pack as much as you can into every day, take a million pictures, and document everything on social media to advertise that you are as energetic in leisure as you are at work. On the opposite end of the spectrum, Couch Potato, which means that you fritter away the entire two weeks doing very little. Other popular options include Two Endless Weeks in My Childhood Bedroom (for 20-somethings) and A Whole Month&#39;s Pay Shot at Disney Because the Kids Whined All Year (for 30-somethings).<br><br> One great vacation model, which harks back to the ancients, is frequently overlooked. The word for “leisure” in Greek is σχολή, or <i>skhole</i> . In Latin, the word is <i>schola</i> —from which we get “school.” In other words, the name for the place where we teach and learn derives from the word for “leisure.” One way to interpret this is that education is a recreational activity (a concept that may strike my hardworking students as counterintuitive). But a better explanation comes from the 20th-century philosopher Josef Pieper, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://books.google.com/books/about/Leisure.html?id=VKbcnmvM7N8C&amp;source=kp_book_description">believed</a> that leisure is the circumstance in which we can learn the most, if we understand and use it properly.<br><br> If the conventional vacation models are leaving you cold, Pieper&#39;s insight could provide the holiday you&#39;ve been looking for. This year, consider using your time off as an opportunity to learn something wonderful.<br><br> P <span class="smallcaps">eople pursue</span> different objectives in their vacations, but no one I have ever met was seeking <i>lower</i> levels of positive emotion. The point is to be happier than usual, which is why a bad vacation is so frustrating—it feels like a missed opportunity to reset and make some emotional progress.<br><br> To get the most contentment from your vacation, it is worthwhile to start with an understanding of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00781/full#:~:text=Robert%20Plutchik%20proposed%20eight%20primary,them%20in%20a%20color%20wheel.">basic</a> human emotions. The negative side includes anger, sadness, fear, and disgust, which alert us to threats and stimulate behaviors such as fight or flight to keep us safe. These are obviously not the emotions you are hoping to experience on vacation—though all bets are off if a long car ride with the kids is involved.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/07/pre-vacation-time-off-work-pressure/670939/">Read: Why must we work so hard before vacation?</a><br><br> An abundance of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3122271/">basic positive emotions</a> such as joy, surprise, and anticipation are what you seek. But you shouldn&#39;t neglect another positive emotion of special importance: interest—the feeling of curiosity or fascination that captures your attention.<br><br> The experience of interest is favored by evolution: It comes from learning new things, which rewarded our ancestors with more food and a greater chance at survival and reproduction. The same tendency for your Pleistocene hominin forebear to feel satisfaction after devising a novel way to catch a small animal persists in us today when we first master riding a bike or succeed in making a presentable soufflé.<br><br> The well-being effect from learning is not as straightforward as it is for other activities, such as eating a doughnut. In fact, it involves a bit of sacrifice. As scholars <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-009-9166-1">found</a> in 2011, investing in an activity to raise competency can lower your moment-to-moment happiness but can boost well-being measured over a longer time frame of hours and days. This makes perfect sense, of course: You rack your brain <i>learning</i> calculus but then bask in <i>knowing</i> it. In that respect, learning is like exercise: sometimes painful in the moment but rewarding overall.<br><br> A key to maximizing satisfaction through learning is intrinsic motivation, or what the psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (who famously wrote about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cgu.edu/people/mihaly-csikszentmihalyi/">“flow states”</a> ) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-9094-9_7">called</a> “autotelic learning”: learning for its own sake. Neuroscientists in 2014 used fMRI technology to show that this type of learning has to do with the brain&#39;s response to curiosity. They <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(14)00804-6?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627314008046%3Fshowall%3Dtrue">demonstrated</a> high levels of activity in the midbrain and a structure known as the nucleus accumbens, which indicated an enhanced release of dopamine, when study participants were highly curious about a subject. In other words, satisfying your curiosity through learning about whatever you&#39;re most interested in will give you a neurochemical payoff.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C. Brooks?

You might be tempted to extrapolate from this evidence to predict, for example, that if everybody went to college, we would have a happier society. Not so fast: One 2017 study <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-017-9504-0">suggests</a> that whether higher education drives happiness up or down depends on, among other things, where you live. In nations without high levels of education, many of which are considered developing countries, university education is associated with higher happiness. In countries with labor markets saturated with educated individuals, which is characteristic of greater economic development, the effect is reversed—university attendance is associated with lower happiness. One possible explanation is that for the former group, university training offers a path out of poverty, but for the latter group much of this effect has long since been depleted. Alternatively, something about the rich-world college experience may contribute to lower well-being. Suffice to say that the sort of leisure learning the Greeks had in mind is not identical with the modern American college experience.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">aken together</span> , the research points to a clear strategy to build a great vacation: Identify something you are very interested in for its own sake and focus on it intensively. And because the task or skill should be challenging enough to increase competence, the satisfaction goal should be understood in hours and days, not in the moment to moment of learning.<br><br> You can choose a range of ways to achieve this outcome, whether cheap and casual or expensive and formal. At one end of the scale, you can simply program your own reading curriculum. Over two weeks, you might set about carefully reading four books on a particular topic. Or you might decide to read the entire Bible or Quran. You might also mix your media: reading a biography of JS Bach, for instance, while listening to 50 of his cantatas.<br><br> At a more formal level, you might dedicate your vacation to taking a class. Perhaps you want to learn how to cook Punjabi cuisine, or follow one of the many “massive open online classes” (MOOCs, for short) that are available for free, such as—random example—one about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.edx.org/course/managing-happiness">exploring the science of happiness</a> . For a more intensive (and expensive) option, you might hire a teacher to give you a head start on playing the guitar or speaking Mandarin, and do that for several hours every day. Or hire a nutrition-and-fitness coach. You will be amazed at how much progress you can make in two weeks.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/04/covid-workcation-remote-work-life-balance/629605/">Read: &#39;Workcations&#39; aren&#39;t an escape. They&#39;re practice.</a><br><br> At the most rigorous level, you might go all in and spend your vacation on a guided silent retreat in one spiritual tradition or another. Or perhaps you could make a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/09/happiness-walking-pilgrimage/620075/">pilgrimage</a> , walking in contemplation without devices or interruptions, and immersing yourself during rest periods in a wisdom literature that complements the experience.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">na famous passage</span> of <i>The Republic</i> , Plato <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0168%3Abook%3D7&amp;force=y">advises</a> on how to educate children in a way that will bring out their best: “Do not … keep children to their studies by compulsion but by play. That will … better enable you to discern the natural capacities of each.” In other words, kids will learn better if you allow them to enjoy recreation in a constructive way, rather than forcing them to study, which is more likely to stimulate rebellion.<br><br> A similar principle lies behind the best model of vacation. Feeling compelled to relax and have fun is a common and counterproductive mistake. Telling yourself “I <i>will</i> be refreshed and not think about work!” is bound to lead in the wrong direction. Instead, employ a Platonic strategy and turn your leisure into learning. You might just have your best holiday ever.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

形状的物体上，然后看着它突然加速并消失。<br><br>然而，最令人期待的言论来自一位名叫大卫·格鲁什的前军事情报官员，他上个月刚刚<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/alien-intact-vehicles-ufo-us-government/674323/">公开了自己的账户</a>。格鲁施告诉众议院国家安全监督小组委员会，美国政府花了几十年的时间秘密回收在地面坠毁的神秘车辆，并确定这些材料是“非人类”来源的。格鲁什表示，政府还试图对部分技术进行逆向工程。而且这一切都是秘密进行的，没有受到国会的适当监督。<br><br>在听证会上，格鲁施进一步阐述了他之前的主张，回答了议员的问题。如果民选官员以前从未听说过这项工作，那么它是如何获得资金的呢？<em>军方窃取了分配给其他项目的资金</em>。一名国防官员最近在国会作证说，美国军方尚未发现地球上存在任何外星活动的证据；这种说法正确吗？<em>这不准确。</em>是否有任何活动具有攻击性或敌意？<em>我的同事受伤了</em>。是不明飞行物，还是政府内部人员？<em>两者都有</em>。<br><br>国会半个多世纪没有举行过有关不明飞行物的听证会，最近又举行了两次听证会。从这个意义上说，我们可以将今天的事件视为历史性事件。但与其他听证会一样，这次听证会没有重大揭示，也没有对人类最关乎生存的问题——我们在宇宙中的地位——给出宏大的答案。围绕听证会的炒作——而且已经有<a

（今天在国会，格鲁施拒绝透露有关这一点和许多其他主张的细节，称他只能向公众透露这么多，并且他可以在封闭的环境中详细阐述。）<br><br>过去几年恰逢不明飞行物文化前所未有的主流化。 2017年，当一个星际物体出现在我们的太阳系中时，大多数科学家都认为它是一颗小行星或彗星，但也有人说它可能是一艘外星飞船。 （领导后一个阵营的哈佛大学教授阿维·勒布最近<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/science/avi-loeb-extraterrestrial-life.html">领导了一次海​​底探险</a>，以回收他认为可能来自外星飞船的材料。）那年晚些时候， <em>《纽约时报》</em>和其他新闻媒体透露，五角大楼有一个致力于对不明飞行物进行编目的秘密计划。经过多年的明确指导后，美国宇航局决定<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/06/nasa-ufo-uap-research-team/661229/">权衡这个话题</a>，并<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/nasa-ufos-conspiracy-theories/674259/">召集一个团队</a>从“科学角度”考虑不明飞行物。谁能忘记今年军方从天上发射的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/02/unidentified-flying-objects-chinese-spy-balloon-american-alien-ufo-obsession/673068/">间谍气球</a>？<br><br>这些事件的发生与公众对地球以外宇宙的认识发生了转变，这可能有助于解释为什么人们对此感兴趣。在 20 世纪 40 年代，我们所知道的唯一行星是太阳周围的行星，而科学家最近才确定除了我们自己的星系之外还存在其他星系。如今，天文学家已经发现了 5000 多颗系外行星，望远镜几乎可以追溯到大爆炸时期。面对如此多的奇迹，我们是否与其他人分享它们的问题变得更加紧迫，甚至似乎更容易回答。 “我认为人们已经准备好，或者至少对与外星人接触的可能性感到兴奋，也许比以往任何时候都更加兴奋，”蓝色大理石太空科学研究所的天体生物学家雅各布·哈克·米斯拉告诉我。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/nasa-ufos-conspiracy-theories/674259/">阅读：美国宇航局了解不明飞行物的丑陋真相</a><br><br>国会也为这种主流化做出了贡献。在立法者的指示下，五角大楼去年设立了一个特别办公室，专门调查天空、海上和陆地上无法解释的现象的报告。这项努力是两党共同努力的，极右翼共和党人和进步民主党人都呼吁军方更加透明。本月，参议员查克·舒默<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/politics/ufo-records-schumer.html">提出</a>立法，将设立一个委员会，有权解密有关不明飞行物的政府文件。舒默在一份声明中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/schumer-rounds-introduce-new-legislation-to-declassify-government-records-related-to-unidentified-anomalous-phenomena-and-ufos_modeled-after-jfk-assassination-records-collection-act--as-an-amendment-to-ndaa">表示</a>：“美国公众有权了解来源不明的技术、非人类智能和无法解释的现象。”<br><br>是的，我们愿意。但<em>一些有关不明飞行物的未公开文件</em>并不等同于<em>外星人访问过地球的无可争议的证据</em>。不明飞行物就是那些我们尚无法识别的正在飞行的物体。如果军方滥用纳税人的钱来调查它不认识的神秘残骸，那就很糟糕，无论是来自其他国家的无人机还是非人类飞行器的残骸。哈克·米斯拉说：“如果情况确实如此，而且审计员没有被允许参与这些项目，并且存在非法的保密层，那么披露这一点就非常重要，与其他任何事物无关”——任何超凡脱俗的事物。但即使立法者声称不明飞行物主要是一个国家安全问题，但通过在讨论中援引外星人的说法，他们还是相信了两者之间存在联系的想法。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/05/congress-pentagon-ufo-hearing-aliens/629910/">阅读：UFO 讨论真正需要什么</a><br><br>格鲁施小心翼翼地告诉立法者，他只是“按照我被告知的事实说话”——也就是说，他本人没有看到任何外星人残骸或其居民的证据。总的来说，尽管他的主张充满了权威的语言，但他根本无法提供任何具体的证据。最先发表格鲁施言论的新闻网站报道称，五角大楼已批准他公开发表言论，但这仅意味着他的言论不包含机密信息，并不意味着这些言论是真实的。在国会宣誓作证也不能衡量真相。在听证会之外，一些立法者<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/igorbobic/status/1684291248461426706">似乎</a>不知道如何看待这些说法。<br><br>外星入侵者的前景可能是一个国家安全问题，但它也是一个科学问题。科学需要数据，而二手资料并不是数据。 “当美国宇航局将岩石带回月球时，这些岩石会与合格的人分享，”普林斯顿大学天体物理学家、美国宇航局不明飞行物委员会主席戴维·斯佩格尔告诉我。 “想象一下，我们有一些工艺品的样本，[并且]我们真的很想了解它是什么。你可以从这些小样本中获取材料，供世界任何地方的实验室使用。”换句话说，有意义的证词将<em>展示</em>外星飞船和飞行员的证据，而不仅仅是告诉公众它们。 “那真是太棒了，”他说，但这不是我们所拥有的。今天，我们听到了一些非凡的主张，引用卡尔·萨根的话，它们需要非凡的证据。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 22:40:49 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

恤遮住了他修长、运动的胸部；他的黑发剪短了——以捍卫他结束空军预备役服役的决定。 “我们不是撕毁社会契约的人，”他说。 “我们发誓要为一个犹太民主国家服务。如果内塔尼亚胡要结束以色列作为自由民主国家的地位，那么违反契约的就是这个国家，而不是我们。”<br><br>节目中的另一位飞行员、以色列议会议员马坦·卡哈纳（Matan Kahana）同意施瓦茨的观点，即总理本杰明·内塔尼亚胡正在将国家拖向“第三圣殿的毁灭”。不过，他坚称飞行员终止服役的决定是错误的，“因为那是审判日的武器。”他警告了后果：“拒绝服役将毁掉军队；它会撕裂这个国家。”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-limit-supreme-court-power-protests/674819/">纳坦·萨克斯：以色列处于边缘</a><br><br>“这个国家不是已经四分五裂了吗？”主持人之一奥菲拉·阿萨亚格 (Ofira Asayag) 进行了反击。 “这个国家已经被摧毁了。”<br><br><span class="smallcaps">在这句话中，</span>阿萨亚格准确地捕捉到了数百万以色列人的感受。以色列的政治危机不再是支持或反对内塔尼亚胡政府承诺实施的司法改革。这不再是关于法律的问题；而是关于法律的问题。这意味着数百万公民对政府的信任几乎完全被削弱。这是一种对许多人来说深刻而神圣的东西已经破碎的感觉，正如阿萨亚格所说，“这个国家已经被摧毁了”。<br><br>在节目后期，她向施瓦茨提出了他的立场所引发的棘手问题：“如果出现紧急情况，如果我们受到攻击，你是要上飞机还是不上飞机？”施瓦茨躲开了。阿萨亚格看到他蠕动，听到他的声音沙哑，盯着他的眼睛，问他一个以色列人很少问战斗机飞行员的问题：“你为什么哭？”<br><br> “我没有哭，”施瓦茨回答道。<br><br>但这并不完全正确，过了一会儿他承认。 “我在想我的祖父，”他补充道。 “他是这个国家的建设者之一……我们所有人之间有一份不成文的契约，我们都是一个人，我们在这里打仗的原因只有一个——为了在我们自己的土地上获得安全。这就是本杰明·内塔尼亚胡正在摧毁的东西。他正在带领我们摧毁第三圣殿，现在我不能再和我的祖父说话了——我必须向他解释我没有为这个国家服务？这让我心碎……我的心都碎了。”<br><br><span class="smallcaps">以色列已经成为</span>一个心碎的国家，一个人民因不相信事情已经发展到这一步而瘫痪的国家。预备役军人是以色列国防军战备的重要组成部分，数千人已经退出志愿服务，这引起了一些人的嘲笑和另一些人的奉承。他们在空军中队、网络战部队、医疗队、类似于海豹突击队的特种作战部队中服役——几乎没有一支精锐部队没有受到过打击。以色列国防军参谋长赫尔齐·哈勒维和国防部长约阿夫·加兰特（内塔尼亚胡执政联盟成员）都直言不讳地指出，以色列国防军的战斗能力很可能已经受到严重削弱。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/benjamin-netanyahu-coalition-israel-democracy/672693/">尤西·克莱因·哈勒维：内塔尼亚胡对民主的背叛就是对以色列的背叛</a><br><br>军队能否痊愈也不清楚。如果以色列选择从约旦河西岸部分地区撤军或被迫撤军，宗教士兵——他们现在占军官的绝大多数，而且基本上反对领土妥协——会服从命令吗？尽管他们不同意政府的政策，但在 2005 年从加沙撤离期间他们确实服从了。但如果司法改革的反对者现在拒绝任职，其他团体有一天可能也会这样做。一个自建国以来一直处于战争状态的国家还有一支正常运作的军队吗？答案远非显而易见。<br><br>一周又一周席卷以色列街头的<span class="smallcaps">抗议运动的批评者</span>提出了两个简单的主张。首先，他们说，长期以来很明显以色列需要某种形式的司法改革。其次，他们提醒那些愿意倾听的人，这个政府是民主选举产生的。一些竞选者（但值得注意的是，不是内塔尼亚胡）直接表达了他们当选后的意图。因此，这些批评者声称，抗议活动意味着建国的特权阶层——科技企业家、飞行员、医生、教授、法官、金融工作者——在选举失败后成为痛苦的失败者。自建国以来，以色列的人口构成发生了根本性的变化。创始人的后代现在是少数，他们也不妨习惯一下。<br><br>许多抗议者承认司法改革的必要性，但坚称内塔尼亚胡的提议太过分了。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_r-5u_lT6TIc27SjireMrlNux1roM72C/view">中间派学者</a>同意他们的观点。更不祥的是，抗议运动向所有人表明，数百万以色列人对拟议的变革感到恐惧。他们恳求说，慢点。正如备受尊敬的希伯来大学法学教授内塔·巴拉克-科伦 (Netta Barak-Corren) 所<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.asefam.org/_files/ugd/e56056_068dba527b5c4005a11440cdea743084.pdf">建议的</a>那样，让我们​​进行一次全国性对话，或者召开一次制宪会议。<br><br>但那些迫切要求立即进行深远改革的人——包括司法部长亚里夫·莱文(Yariv Levin)和议会宪法、法律和司法委员会主席西姆查·罗斯曼(Simcha Rothman)——却对此一无所获。他们告诉内塔尼亚胡，如果他犹豫，他们就会推翻他的政府。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/02/israel-palestine-west-bank-illegal-settlement-netanyahu/672944/">阅读：从这座山上，你可以看到下一次起义</a><br><br>周一，当决定性的投票在以色列议会展开时，以色列人被内塔尼亚胡夹在恳求妥协的加兰特和警告他将推翻政府的莱文之间的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/tv-report-last-minute-compromise-idea-has-collapsed/">形象</a>所吸引。老本杰明·内塔尼亚胡，这位操作大师和操纵者，已经枯萎了。他任命莱文为代理总理，而他在本周早些时候接受了一次小型心脏手术。以色列人打趣道，内塔尼亚胡已经失去了镇静剂，但莱文仍在管理政府——直接陷入深渊，利用他在议会的多数席位对所有使以色列成为经济、技术、学术、文化和军事强国的精英嗤之以鼻。他无视所有恳求他表现出克制的人，撕碎了社会契约的最后伪装。<br><br>以色列人关于如何共同生活的<span class="smallcaps">几乎每一个假设</span>现在都被撕碎了。内塔尼亚胡将极端正统派政党带入他的政府，正如他过去一直做的那样。希伯来语中的<em>正统派（Haredim）</em>是方便的联盟伙伴。他们对外交政策或大多数国内问题不感兴趣；即使坚持定居点对他们来说也不是一个主要问题。无论加入什么政府，无论是左翼、中间还是右翼，他们始终只提出两项要求：他们希望政府为他们的学校系统提供资金，他们希望继续执行以色列首任总理大卫·本·古里安发起的政策，豁免服兵役的年轻正统派男子。正统学校很少教授数学或英语，这使得毕业生完全没有准备好进入劳动力市场，并且免除年轻的正统男子服兵役以便他们可以继续在犹太教学校学习，这进一步限制了他们与世俗社会的接触。<br><br>本·古里安在以色列早年达成了这项协议，因为他认为正统派在现代犹太国家中是一种异类，是大屠杀前欧洲犹太人的残余，很快就会消亡和消失。但本-古里安完全错了。正统派现在在以色列构成了一支庞大的经济和政治力量。在本-古里安时代，每年有 400 人免服兵役，而到 2010 年，通过同样的安排免服兵役的正统派人数每年达到 62,500 人，增加了 15,000%，而以色列总人口仅增加了 1,200 人百分。<br><br>以色列前政府由纳夫塔利·贝内特领导，任期一年，亚伊尔·拉皮德任期较短，要求接受政府资助的正统学校开始教授基础的世俗研究。以色列公众仍然对哈雷迪姆不参军感到不满，但似乎因看似取得的进展而稍稍安息。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/09/yair-lapid-bibi-netanyahu-israel-extremism-centrism/671483/">杰弗里·戈德堡：能够结束内塔尼亚胡时代的人</a><br><br>因此，当内塔尼亚胡与极端正统政党达成联盟协议，再次免除他们的学校提供​​世俗学习，并承诺通过一项法律，永久免除他们的年轻人服兵役时，令人不满但长期存在的宽容突然破裂了。谴责拟议司法改革的抗议者高呼“平等”。每个人都明白，这不仅意味着权利平等，而且意味着义务平等。抗议者表示，他们不再为正统派付出代价并保护他们。 “他们正在吸干我们的血，”一位电视评论员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-05-21/ty-article/israeli-tv-host-under-fire-after-accusing-haredim-of-being-bloodsuckers/00000188-3dee-d7fa-a1dc-bdef92100000">说道</a>。她遭到严厉批评并被迫道歉，尽管许多人私下里对这种情绪表示赞赏。<br><br>当内塔尼亚胡试图任命以色列议会议员、正统党领袖阿耶·德里担任财政部长时，对极端正统派的愤怒更加强烈。德里在 2000 年因受贿被定罪后入狱，十年后被判逃税罪，然后作为认罪协议的一部分退出政坛。内塔尼亚胡本人是几起严重案件的被告，但他辩称，只要他还是总理，他就不会被送进监狱。他恢复德里职业生涯的计划不仅激起了首相的愤怒，首相似乎为了自己的自由而放弃了一切规范，也激起了正统派的愤怒。<br><br>巴伊兰大学法学院前院长、以色列民主研究所所长耶迪迪亚·斯特恩现任犹太民族政策研究所所长。他被广泛认为是以色列法学界的领军人物之一，并以对正统派情有独钟而闻名，他对他们的生活方式非常钦佩。但是，正如斯特恩后来告诉我的那样，三月份，当骚乱正在展开时，斯特恩去德里的家里看望了他。 “你会让成千上万的正统儿童挨饿，”斯特恩告诉他。德里看上去很困惑。 “你现在掌权了，”斯特恩解释道。 “但是左翼或中间派将会重新掌权，现在，半年，一年，甚至更长的时间。但迟早，它必然会发生。当这种情况发生时，新政府将不会关心你的孩子们有多饿，他们一天唯一的热食来自学校。选民将完全关闭政府资金的龙头，你的社区将陷入更深的贫困。”<br><br>斯特恩告诉我，德里静静地盯着他看了很长一段时间。斯特恩回忆道，很明显，德里突然明白了。<br><br>两周前，同为正统派的住房部长伊扎克·戈德克诺普夫 (Yitzhak Goldknopf) 回应了内塔尼亚胡将在其立法议程中放弃取消司法审查的传闻，这是迄今为止司法改革方案中最具争议的内容。正统派认为终止司法审查至关重要，这一步骤将阻止以色列最高法院推翻永久授予正统派男子军事豁免的法律。戈德克诺普夫告诉记者，结束司法审查是政府生存的“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/haredi-minister-pm-promised-me-override-bill-imperative-for-coalition-survival/">必要条件</a>”。<br><br>戈德克诺普夫无意中所做的事情向街头数十万抗议者发出了信号，即结束司法审查是为了修复破碎的司法系统的想法只是借口。实际的议程是终止法院阻止政府向正统派投降的能力。怒火再次爆发。<br><br>然而几天后，主要的正统派报纸<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-20/ty-article/.premium/israeli-ultra-orthodox-newspaper-calls-for-rethink-of-judicial-overhaul/00000189-72fb-de4e-adeb-ffffb4240000"><em>Yated Ne&#39;eman</em></a>似乎做出了让步。它重申了其长期以来的立场，即“民主对我们来说根本上是陌生的”，正统派在以色列的流亡程度与国家存在之前一样。不过，它表示，正统派在冲突中表明立场是不明智的。这篇社论是一个信号，表明许多正统派现在担心自己做得太过分了，并试图避免成为目前席卷以色列的愤怒的附带损害。<br><br>一些<span class="smallcaps">观察家，</span>其中包括美国犹太慈善家，顽强地坚持希望正统世界能够慢慢开放。即使在正统派内部，也有人希望正统派机构因其几十年来在以色列政治中扮演的角色而受到惩罚。<br><br> Esty Shushan 是 12 个兄弟姐妹中的长子，她自己也是四个孩子的母亲。仅此一点就使她成为正统世界中的叛逆者。她是一位诗人、电影制片人，也是<a

WhatsApp。然而，即使有了她这一代年轻时所没有的信息流，当权者的权力也没有显示出崩溃的迹象。<br><br>蜀山在最近的一次<a data-event-element="inline link"

20 名年轻女性与她一起工作，与十年前她创办该组织时相比，这是惊人的增长。但她是个女人。她是一位女权主义者。她是一名电影制片人。她在各方面都超出了正常水平，被边缘化，没有明显的途径可以做出改变。她担心，正统派世界将与以色列社会的其他部分发生冲突——尽管每个人都会从改变路线中受益。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">甚至以色列的知识产权也</span>因重塑犹太国家的愤怒海啸而动摇。阿萨夫·萨吉夫（我曾与他一起在沙勒姆中心工作）被广泛认为是以色列杰出的保守派公共知识分子。但萨吉夫已经与政府（他一再表示希望政府垮台）以及他的大多数前同事决裂。在社交媒体上，他一直在尖酸刻薄地嘲笑政府、议会成员及其支持者。<br><br>为什么？ “保守主义是一种冷静的风气，”萨吉夫在接受以色列左翼旗舰报纸<em>《国土报》</em>的长篇<a data-event-element="inline link"

“这是一场更喜欢妥协而不是争端的运动。宗教犹太复国主义曾经是一种和解、桥梁力量”，但那些日子已经过去了。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1930/10/zionism-in-palestine/306754/">摘自 1930 年 10 月号：巴勒斯坦的犹太复国主义</a><br><br>以色列右翼为何犯下如此错误？萨吉夫表示，以色列联盟核心的保守主义品牌是美国民粹主义保守主义的直接输入。但萨吉夫说，这是以色列最不需要的东西：“美国的保守主义为我们提供了窥视未来的机会，但这不是一个好兆头。共和党是一个政治、道德和文化的重灾区。”<br><br>萨吉夫对该报表示：“以色列右翼现在正在支持一项不亚于宪法政变的计划。”如果该计划付诸实施，以色列人应该期待什么？ “国家机构的瓦解……在相互争夺权力和资源的党魁之间瓜分战利品、公共安全的丧失、公共金库的掠夺以及普遍无法无天的恶化。”<br><br> S <span class="smallcaps">agiv 的预测</span>现在正在接受检验。议会周一晚间通过了司法改革方案的第一部分。几乎立刻，以色列各地爆发了新的抗议活动。警察担心人们会翻过戒备森严的议会的安全围栏，于是呼叫了增援。在特拉维夫，数千名抗议者封锁了该市的主要高速公路阿亚隆，双向关闭了几个小时。<br><br>那天晚上晚些时候，警察已经受够了。他们拿来高压水枪来浇灌抗议者，骑警则骑着马径直冲向人群。以色列人入睡时电视屏幕上播放着暴力和混乱的画面。<br><br>当他们第二天早上醒来时，许多人惊讶地发现该国的几家报纸都印刷了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://danielgordis.substack.com/p/the-ideological-roots-of-democracy">相同的头版</a>：从上到下只有黑色，以及“以色列民主的黑暗一天”的字样。<br><br>当天上午晚些时候，主要新闻媒体<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ynet.co.il/news/article/ry8dvep9n">宣布</a>，正统派主要政党之一的联合托拉犹太教正在提交一项《基本法》——一项具有宪法地位的立法——该法将一劳永逸地宣布，学习托拉的正统派男子将被认为为国家服务过。内塔尼亚胡领导的利库德集团至少这一次阻止了这一举动，但仅仅提及该提议就让以色列人尝到了未来可能发生的事情。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/03/israel-election-benjamin-netanyahu/618358/">阅读：“内塔尼亚胡正在与民主党人开火”</a><br><br>似乎每个新闻媒体都在试图理解刚刚发生的事情。反对派会要求最高法院推翻前一天晚上通过的法律吗？看来它会介入，而且大多数知识渊博的观察家都认为法院很有可能进行干预。但如果政府随后表示不承认法院的权威怎么办？<br><br>据以色列第 12 频道报道，摩萨德局长戴维·巴尼亚 (David Barnea) 告诉他的一群相关特工，如果突然变得不清楚谁在掌管这个国家，将会发生什么。 “如果事情发生宪法危机，”他向他们保证，“我将站在正确的一边”——暗示他将站在法院一边反对政府。<br><br>很难想象那会是什么样子。反对政府的安全机构？政府否认最高法院的权威？ 75 年来让以色列团结在一起的默契正在以难以想象的速度瓦解。<br><br>那我们会怎样呢？事实是没有人知道。这使得当议会投票后的第二天早上，前总理埃胡德·奥尔默特表达了我们最担心的事情时，我们很难不同意。他说，以色列“正在陷入内战”。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 26 Jul 2023 16:13:42
