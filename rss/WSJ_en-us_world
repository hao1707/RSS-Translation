The main opposition party in parliament in a statement called the payout an effort by the government to sidestep accountability for failing to provide safe housing for school children.</p><p> After the fire, several teachers left the community to seek psychological help.

As of May, 6.3% of workers whose employers used the software earned tips, compared with 5.6% in 2020. The number remained relatively flat between 2016 and 2020.</p><p> As of June, service-sector workers in non-restaurant leisure and hospitality jobs made $1.35 an hour in tips, on average, up 30% from the $1.04 an hour they made in 2019, according to an analysis of 300,000 small and midsize businesses by payroll provider Gusto.</p><p> Tips now increase wages for service workers by an average of 25%, compared with 20% between 2019 and 2020, according to Gusto. In May, the average hourly service-industry worker earned $16.64 an hour in base wages and $4.23 an hour in tips.</p><p> During pandemic lockdowns, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tipping-point-of-sale-software-bfd7ac3e?st=0yiom1m7uodfffn&amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink&amp;mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">customers of many service businesses began tipping</a> to acknowledge workers who put themselves at risk. Rehman said that made businesses reliant on the practice. Employers with already tight margins say there&#39;s no going back.</p><p> “With businesses still preparing for the possibility of a recession, they don&#39;t want to lock into higher wages,” said Jonathan Morduch, a professor of public policy and economics at New York University. “Tipping gives them more flexibility.” He said the practice pushes the financial risk that employers would ordinarily shoulder onto workers. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Lodging and food service have had the highest quit rate for workers since July 2021, consistently above 4.9% per three months, the US Chamber of Commerce said in a May 2023 report. The quit rate for the retail trade industry isn&#39;t far behind, around 3.3% so far in 2023. In May 2023, the overall quit rate for workers was 2.6%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p><p> Dan Moreno, founder of Miami-based Flamingo Appliance Service, decided in 2020 to add an option for customers to tip his employees, reasoning that his home-repair technicians were taking health risks by entering customers&#39; homes during the pandemic.</p><p> About one-third of customers now leave a tip of between 10% and 20%, Moreno said. The requests add an average of $650 a year to his 182 technicians&#39; salaries, about 1% of their total yearly income. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Competition for workers is fierce. Were he to eliminate the gratuity prompt, he said, he would have to raise prices beyond the 18% he already has, on average, since 2019—likely costing him clients.</p><p> He knows the requests might turn off some customers, but as the son of a repair technician and a former technician himself, he said, he tries to do as much as he can for his workers.</p><p> Within the food-service industry, tips as a share of compensation are rising faster at limited-service establishments such as bakeries and coffee shops than at full-service ones, according to Gusto.</p><p> At the Main Squeeze Juice Co. in Mandeville, La., tips add $3 to $5 to workers&#39; hourly pay, which starts at $10. Owner Zachary Cheaney said he added the option when he opened the location in 2020.</p><p> “We can&#39;t just say, &#39;Oh, we&#39;re going to charge $2 extra&#39; instead of having tips, because we have a duty to our customers to have a very fair price point,” said Cheaney, who also consults for Main Squeeze&#39;s corporate office. If customers think the price is too high, he said, they won&#39;t return. Asking them to tip, he said, is different because it&#39;s optional.</p><p> “If customers completely stopped tipping, we would be forced to pay employees more, and it would be hard on us as business operators in this crazy environment of rising costs,” he said.</p><p> The juice bar&#39;s general manager, Tiffany Naquin, said tips make up about one-tenth of her $46,000 annual pay. Workers like tips, she said, “in all industries. It&#39;s that little extra.” Knowing a customer will see a gratuity screen at the end motivates employees, she said. “If you give employees incentives, they are going to give you better work,” she said. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

She understands if someone declines to tip, she said, and she wouldn&#39;t let that affect the quality of service.</p><p> Morduch, the New York University economics professor, said that while most people tend to think of tips as steady income, many businesses fluctuate seasonally—which means employee pay goes up and down. Service workers who receive tips, he added, are often lower income and struggle to deal with such volatility.</p><p> Saru Jayaraman, a labor advocate and director of the Food Labor Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley, said that boosting tips without increasing base pay is bad for workers. If customers stop tipping, she said, worker pay effectively declines, which it wouldn&#39;t if employees got a raise.</p><p> “Employers think they&#39;re being smart by using tipping instead of raising wages,” she said. “But really they&#39;re risking losing staff, because it&#39;s pissing consumers off and the employees are the ones who have to deal with it.”</p><p> A May survey of about 2,400 Americans by financial services company Bankrate found that consumers are tipping less often than they did at the height of the pandemic. Forty-one percent of respondents said businesses should pay their employees better rather than rely so much on tips. Roughly a third said <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/you-want-20-for-handing-me-a-muffin-the-awkward-etiquette-of-ipad-tipping-1539790018?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">tipping culture is out of hand</a> .</p><p> Denver retiree Mary Medley, though, said she sees being a generous tipper as part of her economic responsibility. For her, it isn&#39;t about how difficult a task was, but whether she can lighten someone else&#39;s financial burden, even a little.</p><p> “It&#39;s not my job to figure out where it goes or how it gets distributed,” she said. “But if they&#39;re giving me the opportunity to participate in supporting a business in a tangible way, I&#39;ll do so.”</p><p> Write to Rachel Wolfe at <a href="mailto:rachel.wolfe@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">rachel.wolfe@wsj.com</a></p></section></div></main></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 23 Jul 2023 09:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.wsj.com/articles/tipping-businesses-cant-stop-asking-cc1aca6c</guid><link/> https://www.wsj.com/articles/tipping-businesses-cant-stop-asking-cc1aca6c<author><![CDATA[Rachel Wolfe]]></author><category> gfx-contrib</category><category> leder</category><category> wsjlifework</category><category> Computers/Consumer Electronics</category><category> Household Appliances</category><category> Lodgings/Restaurants/Bars</category><category> Restaurants/Caterers</category><category> Full-service Restaurants</category><category> Limited-Service Restaurants</category><category> Lodgings</category><category> Hotels/Motels</category><category> Consumer Goods</category><category>耐用家居产品</category><category>Consumer Electronics</category><category>家用电子/电器</category><category>Leisure/Arts/Hospitality</category><category>技术</category><category>Tourism</category><category>营销</category><category>劳工/人事</category><category>企业/行业新闻</category><category>Customer Experience</category><category>客户关系管理</category><category>Markets/Marketing</category><category> Workers Pay</category><category>经济表现/指标</category><category>经济新闻</category><category>Services Sector Figures</category><category>政治/一般新闻</category><category>一般劳工问题</category><category>内容类型</category><category>法激活过滤器</category><category>会展行业新闻过滤器</category><category>SYND</category><category>华尔街日报-PRO-WSJ.com</category><category> marketing</category><category>劳动</category><category>人员</category><category>公司的</category><category>行业新闻</category><category>customer experience</category><category>客户关系管理</category><category>markets</category><category> workers pay</category><category>经济表现</category><category>指标</category><category>经济新闻</category><category>services sector figures</category><category>政治的</category><category>一般新闻</category><category>一般劳工问题</category><category>内容类型</category><category>法蒂瓦过滤器</category><category>会展行业新闻过滤器</category><category>computers</category><category> consumer electronics</category><category> household appliances</category><category> lodgings</category><category> restaurants</category><category> bars</category><category> caterers</category><category> full-service restaurants</category><category> limited-service restaurants</category><category> hotels</category><category> motels</category><category> consumer goods</category><category>耐用家用产品</category><category>家用电子产品</category><category>电器</category><category>leisure</category><category>艺术</category><category>hospitality</category><category>技术</category><category>tourism </category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Spain Votes in Election That Could Signal Shift to the Right]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> While the poll might not produce a clear winner, the Spanish far-right has never been closer to entering government <!-- data-module-name="article.app/lib/module/wsj/breadcrumbs" --><main id="main" role="main"><div class="wsj-article-headline-wrap crawler"></div><div class="articleLead" itemprop="articleLead" data-sbid="WP-WSJ-0001073435"><div class="is-lead-inset"><div class="media-object scope-

For me, he has no credibility. Vox is the opposite,” said Martín.</p><p> Vox&#39;s elevation from antiestablishment party to possible kingmaker is in line with a broader rightward shift happening across Europe.

Instead, the campaign risks descending into a stalemate with the potential to burn through lives and equipment without a major shift in momentum.</p><p> As the likelihood of any large-scale breakthrough by the Ukrainians this year dims, it raises the unsettling prospect for Washington and its allies of a longer war—one that would require a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/france-to-become-second-nation-to-send-ukraine-cruise-missiles-da072c03?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">huge new infusion</a> of sophisticated armaments and more training to give Kyiv a chance at victory.</p><p> The political calculus for the Biden administration is complicated.

Kyiv&#39;s inability to make headway against Russian defenses has persuaded many Western military observers that Ukrainian forces need more training in complex military maneuvers, more-potent air defenses and much more armor.</p><p> Moscow&#39;s military, meanwhile, is grappling with low morale because of exhaustion, poor supplies and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-infighting-escalates-as-wagner-claims-army-fired-on-its-troops-2f2ebf9d?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noopener">infighting among Russian leaders</a> , Ukrainian and Western intelligence indicates. Russia appears unable to seize the initiative and attack Ukrainian positions, but its forces remain robust enough to man hundreds of miles of fortifications and large numbers of aircraft, which are keeping Kyiv&#39;s troops at bay.</p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"></div><p> The situation is a sharp change from last year, when Ukraine&#39;s scrappy and at-times uncoordinated fighters stunned Moscow and the world by halting and then repelling a far greater number of Russian forces from around Kyiv, and then Kharkiv and Kherson.</p><p> In those battles, Ukraine used a highly mobile, decentralized defense against Russia&#39;s larger but lumbering ground forces. Moscow made limited use of its formidable air forces, failing to gain air superiority, which in turn allowed Ukrainian ground forces to batter Russian troops and their supplies.</p><p> Now, Ukraine is on the offensive against Russian positions where troops have had months to build extensive defenses including minefields, barriers and bunkers. Western military doctrine holds that to attack a dug-in adversary, an attacking force should be at least three times the enemy&#39;s size and use a well-coordinated combination of air and land forces.</p><p> Kyiv&#39;s troops lack the mass, training and resources to follow those prescriptions.</p><p> “Ukraine really needs to be able to scale up and synchronize military operations if it wants to be able to break through Russian defenses,” said Franz-Stefan Gady, an independent military analyst who recently toured Ukrainian front lines. </p><div class="media-object scope-

The tactic “often telegraphs to the Russians that they&#39;re attacking,” he said.</p><p> The small-scale approach, which is easier for commanders to orchestrate than pushing ground forces under covering artillery, creates its own problems, such as reduced mobility. Safely removing wounded soldiers from the front and bringing in fresh ammunition is more treacherous in company-level operations because the medical and logistics corps are less protected.</p><p> Conducting synchronized large-scale attacks is difficult for any armed force—even Western ones with more and better equipment than Ukraine has—because integrating vast numbers of land and air troops in the fast, violent ballet of a frontal assault is enormously difficult.</p><p> No Western military would also try to breach established defenses without controlling the skies.</p><p> “America would never attempt to defeat a prepared defense without air superiority, but they [Ukrainians] don&#39;t have air superiority,” said John Nagl, a retired US Army lieutenant colonel who is now an associate professor of warfighting studies at the US Army War College. “It&#39;s impossible to overstate how important air superiority is for fighting a ground fight at a reasonable cost in casualties.”</p><p> Zelensky acknowledged in an interview with The Wall Street Journal in May that Russia has air superiority at the front and that a lack of protection for Ukrainian troops means “a large number of soldiers will die” in the fight.</p><p> Ukraine had hoped to find gaps in Russia&#39;s fortifications, flood troops through, and cause the kind of havoc that its forces achieved last year among enemy ranks. Instead, unexpectedly dense minefields slowed Kyiv&#39;s initial attacking forces, leaving them exposed to strikes from Russian aircraft and rockets.</p><p> Russian drones and attack helicopters, particularly Kamov Ka-52 “Alligator” gunships, have proven particularly dangerous. Ka-52s, which are among Russia&#39;s most modern aircraft, can remain far behind Russian lines and rely on targeting data from spotter drones scanning the front. Their laser-guided Vikhr missiles have a range of roughly 5 miles, which is more than twice the range of any portable antiaircraft missiles in Ukraine&#39;s armory.</p><p> US Defense Department analysts knew early this year that Ukraine&#39;s front-line troops would struggle against <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-war-counteroffensive-frontlines-russia-add3e4e4?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noopener">Russian air attacks</a> . A classified Pentagon assessment from February, allegedly leaked by Air National Guard Airman Jack Teixeira, tallied a tiny number of weapons in Ukrainian hands able to hit distant aircraft and cited the risk of “inability to prevent Russian air superiority.”</p><p> Kyiv lacks sufficient air-defense equipment—such as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/lockheed-martin-lmt-q2-earnings-report-2023-370bf62e?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noopener">US-made Patriot batteries</a> or more mobile German Gepard systems—to deploy many near front lines. Patriots and other large, less-mobile systems are also vulnerable to Russian drone attacks.</p><p> Ukraine&#39;s paucity of battlefield air-defenses and antiaircraft weaponry has allowed Russia to dominate skies along much of the front. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Ukraine has only a small air force of Soviet-made planes and helicopters.</p><p> F-16s, which are modern but not the latest US jet fighters, could pose enough of a threat to Russian aircraft that they might be less dangerous to Ukrainian ground forces and civilian infrastructure, according to advocates for providing the planes.</p><p> Ukrainian pilots and mechanics are preparing to train to fly and maintain the complex jets, through a coalition of at least 10 European countries. But Biden hasn&#39;t yet given the necessary permission for F-16s to be delivered to Ukraine, and establishing supply chains to support and repair the planes would take months. The soonest F-16s could appear on the battlefield is probably early next year, say analysts.</p><p> If Ukraine receives the planes, their impact on fighting would depend on many factors, including the number supplied, the sophistication of their onboard equipment and the weapons systems provided to arm them. Incorporating advanced jet fighters into battle plans is also extremely complicated, requiring another level of synchronization in Ukrainian operations.</p><p> “There&#39;s no silver bullet in war,” said US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley in April, when asked about F-16s for Ukraine. “The outcomes of battles and wars are the function of many, many variables.”</p><p class="articleTagLine"> — Isabel Coles contributed to this article.</p><p> Write to Daniel Michaels at <a href="mailto:Dan.Michaels@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">Dan.Michaels@wsj.com</a> </p><div class="media-object scope-

"></div><p> Russia notched a victory in the fight for influence over global oil markets in recent days when the price of the country&#39;s most coveted crude traded above a Western price cap imposed to starve Moscow of funds for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-adopts-slow-approach-to-counteroffensive-our-problem-everywhere-is-the-sky-a2e51d7a?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">the war in Ukraine</a> .</p><p> It is the first time that the price for its flagship Urals grade of oil has breached <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-g-7-wait-on-poland-to-advance-with-russian-oil-price-cap-11669983529?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">the $60-a-barrel limit</a> since the US and its allies introduced the novel sanctions policy last December, according to commodities-data firm Argus Media. It is a sign that the Kremlin has succeeded, at least in part, in adjusting to the restrictions.</p><p> The cap is part of a Western <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-plans-to-expand-sanctions-export-controls-on-russia-as-g-7-summit-begins-2d551567?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">economic-pressure campaign</a> and targets Russia&#39;s most important revenue source. It is meant to bleed the Kremlin&#39;s war coffers while encouraging Russian producers to keep sending petroleum to market so as not to foment inflation around the world.</p><p> Higher prices could bolster Russia&#39;s oil-export revenues, which last month dropped to just over half their level from a year ago, according to the International Energy Agency. The cap, an embargo on Russian oil in Europe and a recent drop in exports have reduced Russia&#39;s tax take from energy this year, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-races-to-plug-budget-gap-as-oil-revenues-fall-and-war-costs-rise-6f3c8c5?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">hurting the budget</a> . </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"><img width="600" height="800" src="https://images.wsj.net/im-821527?width=600" alt="不明确的" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><p> One sign that the financial squeeze on Moscow might be relenting: The discount for Urals, compared with benchmark Brent, has narrowed to $20 a barrel. The gap is still far wider than before the war, but it has halved since January.</p><p> Output <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-some-opec-members-clash-over-oil-production-quotas-87f43f0c?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">cuts by OPEC+</a> , which Moscow signed up to, have also helped push Russia&#39;s crude prices above the cap. Urals—named after the mountainous, oil-rich region—got an extra boost from high demand in Asia, where Russian producers are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-set-to-overtake-saudi-arabia-in-battle-for-chinas-oil-market-6435742e?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">elbowing aside Saudi oil</a> .</p><p> Western sanctions strive to use Russia&#39;s longstanding dependence on European shipping and insurance as leverage to contain the income Moscow fetches from crude. Climbing prices suggest Russia&#39;s push to assemble an alternative <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russia-will-rely-on-shadow-tanker-fleet-to-keep-oil-flowing-11670036535?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">network of tankers</a> to which sanctions don&#39;t apply is eroding Western influence over its prize export, said Sergey Vakulenko, an analyst at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center and former oil executive in Russia.</p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps
          wrap
"></div><p> “This was an evolutionary process, and now we just see its results,” said Vakulenko. “Russian oil companies…put quite a lot of effort into staying in business and earning money. They have proven themselves to be capable operators.”</p><p> Traders said Russian producers recently showed little desire to negotiate prices at which Western players could stay in the market. That is a shift since Urals <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-oil-prices-surge-put-sanctions-to-test-bfd6ad30?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">last neared $60</a> , in April.</p><p> To be sure, Russian companies are likely to need Western ships and insurance for some time to export some of the more than seven million barrels of petroleum they sell overseas daily. Some analysts say that gives the US and Europe significant—though waning—leverage, and that they could step up the financial pressure on Moscow by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/g-7-opposes-lowering-russian-crude-price-cap-from-60-a-barrel-586ecc30?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">lowering the cap</a> .</p><p> “If you look at all the routes Russia needs to move on, and count up how many tankers it needs for a stand-alone, autonomous fleet, they are very far away from where they need to be,” said Craig Kennedy, an associate at Harvard University who is working on a study of Russian shipping. </p><div class="media-object scope-

There are separate caps for refined products. The idea is that Moscow will sell petroleum at lower prices because it needs Western services to export its oil.</p><p> Complicating the analysis of whether the cap is working: It became more difficult to measure the price at which Russian crude trades after Moscow&#39;s invasion of Ukraine in February last year.</p><p> Traders and officials rely on estimates by price-reporting agencies. S&amp;P Global used to glean hard data from an <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/ICE" class="company-name">Intercontinental Exchange</a></p> trading platform that hosted sales of Urals.

Ukraine, backed by close allies including Poland, has lobbied to reduce it. Disagreements inside the European Union and concern about gas prices in Washington have stymied them.</p><p> Instead, the US and EU have focused on tightening enforcement. A focus: The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-eu-sanctions-target-russia-loopholes-312c111e?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">laundering of oil</a> through swaps between ships at sea. Fraudulent documentation and side payments have also been used to evade the cap, according to traders.</p><p> A bigger challenge for the sanctions is the new logistics system that Russia and companies in its orbit began to build, consisting of tankers owned, insured and chartered outside the West.</p><p> Sales of secondhand tankers have swollen the shadow fleet—industry parlance for tankers that shuttle petroleum from sanctioned nations. In the second quarter, five times as many tankers worked with sanctioned producers than at the end of 2021, according to ship-tracking firm Vortexa. Almost 80% of those ships have plied the Russian market.</p><p> The West derived leverage in part from the outsize role played by the shipping industry of Greece, which as an EU member observes the sanctions and price cap. The country&#39;s tanker fleet <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-bad-boy-of-shipping-cashes-in-on-russian-oil-4668c238?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">moves more than half of crude</a> exported from Russia, said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance. “The West has true pricing power,” he said, adding that the cap could be lowered to between $20 and $30 a barrel.</p><p> That leverage may be diminishing. The huge sums European tanker companies could earn from renting ships out to move Russian oil have fallen in recent months, suggesting Russia has growing access to tankers owned outside the G-7, said Henry Curra, head of research at shipbroker Braemar.</p><p> At Russia&#39;s Asian port of Kozmino, where a flavor of crude called Espo has traded above the cap all along, few tankers insured or owned by companies in the West are now involved in the oil trade.</p><p> The Biden administration acknowledges that Russia is developing an independent fleet, but a senior Treasury official said it isn&#39;t a significant driver of oil flows. The cost of creating that alternative export system diverts funds from the war, US officials say. They estimate that Russia&#39;s central bank has deployed $9 billion to replace Western reinsurance schemes.</p><p> US, European and Japanese insurers covered almost all of Russia&#39;s seaborne exports before the war, including those on Moscow&#39;s state-owned tankers. Known collectively as the International Group of P&amp;I Clubs, these companies insure against claims from third parties, such as coastal industries affected by an oil spill.</p><div class="media-object scope-web

That poses dangers, he said, because insurers outside the group mostly lack experience in responding to accidents.</p><p> “The concern is that these insurers may not have backing by reinsurers—or, to the extent they do, those reinsurers may not have the resources to meet a major claim,” said Alexander Brandt, a partner at law firm Reed Smith.

A little known tax-advantaged annuity can help avoid that, providing a guaranteed income in the final years of life.</p><p> Starting this year, Americans can use up to $200,000 of their retirement accounts to purchase qualified longevity annuity contracts, or QLACs. The new contribution limit, set by Congress, is up from $145,000 or 25% of your balance, whichever was lower.</p><p> An annuity is an insurance contract that you can buy to provide a steady income like a pension, making it easier to plan for the uncertainty of life expectancy. QLACs have existed for a decade and offer significantly more income for life than a typical immediate annuity, since the payments don&#39;t start until later in life, at, say, age 80 or 85. They also have a special tax benefit.</p><p> The shift from the security of pensions to relying on 401(k)s turned workers into both investors and actuaries, tasked with building a nest egg big enough to last their lifespan. QLACs are a way to remove some of that guesswork.</p><p> “More people should be able to take advantage,” said Mark Iwry, a former Treasury Department adviser who helped create QLACs, in 2014.</p><p> Reducing the balance of your retirement savings cuts down the size of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/reducing-the-pain-from-required-retirement-withdrawals-this-year-11665098435?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">required taxable withdrawals</a> retirees have to take starting at age 73.</p><p> The drawbacks to a QLAC are the upfront cost and that if an emergency occurs and you need money before the beginning of payouts, you can&#39;t touch it. It is locked in. The size of the payout also depends on how long you live. </p><div class="media-object scope-

The payouts of nearly $16,000 a year start when he turns 85. He&#39;ll avoid more than $20,000 in taxable distributions from the IRA over the next few years.</p><p> They chose a lower payout for a death benefit. If they both die before the payouts reach $108,000, their four daughters get the difference.</p><h3> How longevity annuities work</h3><p> With a QLAC, savers hand over money from their retirement account to an insurer near the start of retirement, at, say, age 65. The insurer in turn will agree to pay you a set annual amount for life, starting a decade or two in the future.</p><p> A 65-year-old could buy a $200,000 QLAC without a death benefit that would start monthly payouts of $11,175 at age 85, according to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MET" class="">MetLife</a> <span class="company-name-type">.</span> That is $134,100 of payouts in the first year. A 75-year-old would get just over $7,000 a month, about $84,000 in the first year.</p><div class="media-object scope-web

"><div class="media-object-rich-text"><h4> SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS</h4><p> <em>How are you fitting QLACs into your retirement planning? Join the conversation below.</em></p></div></div><p> In the simplest version of a QLAC, payouts stop when you die or a spouse dies, and the insurance company keeps any money left over. Most contracts have a death benefit provision that lets heirs recoup the purchase price minus any payouts made.</p><p> Adding a death benefit to the annuity reduces the monthly payouts to about $8,700 for the 65-year-old and $5,200 for the 75-year-old, MetLife said. The longer the deferral, the bigger the payouts.</p><p> You&#39;re paying to insure yourself from outliving your retirement savings, Iwry said.</p><p> Annual payouts from a QLAC count as taxable income, but there are some tax advantages. Since the money directed to the annuity is no longer in the retirement account, retirees don&#39;t need to withdraw as much from their savings each year when required minimum distributions begin at age 73. If you have a $1 million retirement account and buy a $200,000 QLAC, your RMDs will be based on the $800,000 balance.</p><h3> Where to purchase a QLAC</h3><p> The two ways to get a QLAC are through your company retirement plan, when the option is available, or on the individual market through a financial planner, insurance agent or brokerage. Fidelity, for example, offers them directly to investors with IRAs through a marketplace of five insurers.</p><p> QLACs are still a niche insurance product. Sales were $234 million in 2022, but the market for this option is considerably larger. Americans have $22.3 trillion in retirement accounts, according to the Investment Company Institute.</p><p> People tend to underestimate their lifespan when planning for the future, advisers said. A 65-year-old woman today who is a nonsmoker and in excellent health has a 54% chance of living to 90, a 31% chance of living to 95 and a 13% of living to 100, according to the Actuaries Longevity Illustrator.</p><p> Some retirees assume they can do better investing the money on their own, said Walter Pardo, a wealth adviser in Liberty Corner, NJ The point is, you are transferring the market risk to the insurer, he said. The security of that fixed-income backstop lets you invest your other assets more aggressively in Roth IRAs or taxable accounts, potentially leaving a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/retirement-inherit-ira-taxes-d6ee70d?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">tax-free legacy to your heirs</a> .</p><p> If you&#39;re healthy and won&#39;t need all your required distributions at the start of retirement, QLACs can be a good bet, especially for women, Pardo said.</p><p> “Guys who say, &#39;I could take the $200,000 and put it in Google,&#39; don&#39;t see the value of the cash flow that this is going to provide for life,” he said.</p><p> Write to Ashlea Ebeling at <a href="mailto:ashlea.ebeling@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">ashlea.ebeling@wsj.com</a> </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"></div><p> Russia and Ukraine now risk a widening of the war that could have major consequences for global food security.战前，俄罗斯和乌克兰合计占世界小麦出口量的 28%，其中大部分通过黑海运输。 The shutdown of Ukraine&#39;s Black Sea exports this week has raised fears of a repeat of a global surge in food prices that resulted from the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year.</p><p> Russia&#39;s blockade of Ukraine and threats to civilian ships have also thrust the Black Sea into the heart of a broader contest for power in the region, intensifying Moscow&#39;s efforts to impose its dominance over the waterway, military analysts say. The Kremlin&#39;s freezing of the grain deal poses a challenge for neighboring Turkey and its president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who helped broker the agreement in the first place, and put pressure on Washington and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to respond. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Russia&#39;s occupation and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/vladimir-putin-signs-treaty-to-annex-crimea-1395144516?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014</a> raised alarms about unchecked Russian power in the region. Erdogan, who has a warm relationship with Russian President <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/vladimir-putin">Vladimir Putin</a> , warned in 2016 that the Black Sea was becoming a “Russian lake.”</p><p> Following Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, capturing the Ukrainian Black Sea coastline and its ports were high among Russia&#39;s strategic aims.港口是乌克兰经济的命脉，战前占乌克兰农产品出口的95%。当入侵开始时，这一数字降至零。 Still, Ukraine drove back Russian forces around the port city of Mykolaiv last year, thwarting a Russian attempt to capture Odesa.</p><p> During the war, Ukrainian forces have managed to chip away at Russia&#39;s considerable firepower in the Black Sea. Ukraine <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-navy-ship-moskva-sunk-by-ukrainian-missiles-u-s-confirms-11650043527?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">sank the flagship of the Russian fleet, the Moskova</a> , in April last year and drove Russian forces from the tiny but strategic Snake Island in June. Ukraine&#39;s domestically made Neptune and Western-supplied Harpoon antiship missiles have also denied Russia access to the waters around Odesa, military analysts say.</p><p> Russia&#39;s forces in the Black Sea remain far more capable than Ukraine&#39;s.莫斯科拥有至少四艘柴油动力潜艇，其中两艘新型格里戈罗维奇级护卫舰配备火箭、鱼雷和巡航导弹，射程约 1,550 英里。 The fleet also includes 10 large amphibious ships and smaller patrol ships. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

If it ruptures or explodes, it could disgorge four times the amount of oil spilled in the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster in Alaska, disrupting one of the world&#39;s busiest shipping lanes and closing off ports bringing humanitarian aid into the war-torn country. A cleanup would cost more than $20 billion, and would never be fully complete, the United Nations estimated.</p><p> Early next week, a UN-led team of international experts is scheduled to begin an audacious operation to siphon out the entirety of the Safer&#39;s volatile cargo.</p><p> The plan is fraught with danger. It involves lining up a very large crude carrier, purchased by the UN as the Nautica and now renamed Yemen, alongside the FSO Safer. The tanks on the two vessels will be connected by pipes and the oil will be shifted using hydraulic pumps. The Safer will then be cleaned of sludge, constituting an estimated 5% of the original cargo, towed to a nearby location and secured to a specially strengthened buoy anchored to the seabed with thick cables. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Pipes and valves on the 47-year-old Safer are badly corroded, increasing the risk that something could go wrong. Moving such a large quantity of oil after sitting still for so long could also dramatically change the pressure on the aging hull, which could rupture. The systems used to maintain safe pressure in the oil storage holds have been inoperable since 2018, raising the risk of a mishap, including, in a worst-case scenario, an explosion. Salvage teams have pumped an inert gas into the tanks in an attempt to stabilize the oil before it is siphoned out.</p><p> Other obstacles include the weather. The crew faces scorching temperatures.

It would temporarily shut down the nearby ports of Hodeidah and Saleef, conduits for crucial food and lifesaving supplies for millions of people displaced by the war. Desalination plants providing drinking water to nearly two million people also risk contamination if there is a spill, according to a study by <strong>&nbsp;</strong> a group of researchers led by Benjamin Q.

The firm warned it would eradicate the local fishing industry and close the ports through which the Houthis hoped to export oil as the peace process progressed.</p><p> “We presented a scenario of what an oil spill would look like on the coast of Yemen,” said Fathi Fahem, the company&#39;s chief executive officer. “When we explained that in detail, they went along with our solution.”</p><p> The company facilitated a meeting in the capital, San&#39;a, between the Houthis and SMIT Salvage, a subsidiary of the Dutch maritime construction and maintenance company Boskalis. Meanwhile, the UN appointed Gressly, a veteran diplomat, to solve the looming tanker crisis, including securing funding for the operation.</p><p> “The presence of the Fahem Group alongside the resident coordinator was indeed a new experience that resulted in mutual trust,” said Hussein al-Ezzi,</p> deputy foreign minister of Ansar Allah, the official name for the Houthi movement. <p></p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

The systems required to maintain inert gas—whose low levels of oxygen prevent the combustion of flammable hydrocarbon gases—were defunct so workers pumped inert gas into the tanks to lower the risk of explosion. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

At a cost of $55 million, it was the single largest expense in the $143 million budgeted for the operation—a necessity imposed by the unwillingness of any leasing company to provide a vessel that size for the purpose. So far the UN has raised $121 million from more than 20 countries, chiefly Saudi Arabia, the Netherlands, Germany and the US, in addition to the International Association of Oil and Gas Producers and some private donors.</p><p> Even if the salvage operation passes off safely, future conflicts are brewing, this time over who actually owns the oil.</p><p> Some 90% of it belongs to Yemen&#39;s national oil-and-gas company, Sepoc, which both the Houthis and the national government in Aden claim to control.</p><p> “The oil itself is a separate discussion to be had with authorities in San&#39;a and the government,” Gressly said. “We&#39;ll be taking one step at a time.” </p><div class="media-object scope-
