（它们味道很好，而且还有一个额外的好处，让我感觉自己很善良。）<br><br>周二晚上，我躺在躺椅上，读一本杂志，喝着一种新品种的啤酒花水，我把它放在一个印有螃蟹和“<span class="smallcaps">别打扰我，我脾气暴躁”字样的小酒花里。</span>我很放松。所以想象一下，当我看到罐子并发现这种饮料含有适应原和促智药时，我有多惊讶。我真的不知道那些是什么；我几乎无法发音后者。我以为我只是喝加了一点调味料的苏打水！我突然想，我感觉有点奇怪是因为我累了，还是因为我的啤酒花水中有补充剂？这种饮料<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/7/8/18772467/nootropics-silicon-valley-brain-fitness-goop-smart-drugs">会让我成为天才</a>吗？<br><br>近年来，各种罐装和瓶装饮料激增。罐装鸡尾酒、硬苏打水、苹果酒、无酒精啤酒、CBD 饮料和啤酒花水与传统啤酒共享货架空间。很难跟上。不断变化的消费者偏好、高昂的经营成本以及竞争压力意味着啤酒行业不再像以前那样成为零售巨头。啤酒曾经在市场上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/spirits-surpass-beer-for-u-s-market-share-supremacy-data-shows">遥遥领先</a>于其他酒精饮料。不再。美国啤酒批发商协会首席经济学家莱斯特·琼斯告诉我， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brewersassociation.org/press-releases/brewers-association-releases-annual-craft-brewing-industry-production-report-and-top-50-producing-craft-brewing-companies-for-2022/">去年市场销量萎缩了 3%</a> ，延续了 2000 年左右开始的下降趋势，而我们现在正处于最糟糕的年份之一自从啤酒开始衰落以来。<br><br>啤酒销量萎缩的部分原因是人们的酒精消费多样化，增加了烈酒等饮料。精酿啤酒贸易组织酿酒师协会的首席经济学家巴特·沃森告诉我，过去 20 年，啤酒价格大致与通货膨胀同步，但酒类却变得相对便宜。十多年来， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/commodity-markets-business-464e8a74c984d1acd65d81ac6df17c52">烈酒</a>一直在扩大市场份额。人口结构的变化也说明了这一点： <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/22/us/census-median-age.html">美国人口的老龄化程度比以往任何时候都要高</a>。随着婴儿潮一代步入退休年龄和千禧一代进入 40 多岁，他们会在不同类型的场合选择不同的饮料。退休人员可能会在晚餐时享用一瓶昂贵的葡萄酒，而千禧一代可能会在生日庆祝活动中混合鸡尾酒。 （或者，如果你是我，你可能会在冷却时喝出啤酒花水。）<br><br>下一代不会伺机取代他们。沃森说，年轻人“只是喝的啤酒少了”，而且总的来说，许多人似乎买的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/claraludmir/2023/06/27/why-genz-is-drinking-less-and-what-this-means-for-the-alcohol-industry/">酒也少了</a>。<i>饮酒</i>者有多种选择。大学生不再只是狂饮 Natty Light 和拍打 Franzia 的袋子。现在，年轻人已经 21 岁了，他们进入了一个充满相对实惠的苏打水、罐装鸡尾酒和苹果酒的市场，更不用说 EANAB，我的大学宿舍用这个名字来形容“同样有吸引力的非酒精饮料”。<br><br>对于那些仍然喝啤酒的人来说，他们想要购买的啤酒<i>数量</i>和种类的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/business/2023/07/beer-sales-decline-explained-hard-seltzer-craft-beer.html">偏好正在发生变化</a>。琼斯解释说：“人们喝的啤酒越来越少，但他们喝的啤酒价格更高。”因为一些批量生产的啤酒变得更加昂贵，而价格更高的精酿啤酒现在占据了更多的市场。沃森告诉我，优质淡啤酒多年来一直在失去市场份额。<br><br>然后，今年春天，随着右翼取消百威淡啤的运动的兴起，淡<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/rise-and-fall-bud-light-boycott/674752/">啤酒</a>受到了人们的关注。跨性别影响者迪伦·马尔瓦尼 (Dylan Mulvaney) 在 Instagram 上发布了该品牌的 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/bud-light-boycott.html">宣传视频</a>后，消费者抵制了该啤酒。 6 月，百威淡啤 (Bud Light) 在连续 20 年成为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/rise-and-fall-bud-light-boycott/674752/">美国最畅销啤酒</a>后， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/23/business/modelo-bud-light.html">被莫德罗 (Modelo) 超越</a>。这并非完全出乎意料——沃森告诉我，莫德罗能否登上顶峰“只是时间问题，而不是是否会出现的问题”，尽管强烈反对加速了这一趋势。多年来，随着<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/23/business/modelo-bud-light.html">消费者开始倾向于</a>更昂贵的进口啤酒，莫德罗一直有望超越百威淡啤。<br><br>在强烈反对之后，百威淡啤的两名高管<a data-event-element="inline link"

Heinerscheid。海纳沙伊德<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/10/business/media/beer-ads-super-bowl.html">当时以百威淡啤营销副总裁的身份告诉我</a>，该品牌的 2023 年超级碗广告以一对情侣边喝啤酒边跳舞的轻松场景为特色，旨在传达一种比百威淡啤“更轻盈、更明亮”的能量。过去几年（著名的过去广告包括百威啤酒的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2022/06/14/world-s-best-ads-ever-15-budweiser-simply-asks-wassup">“Wasssuuuup”</a>和百威淡啤的原创派对动物， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/magazine/letter-of-recommendation-spuds-mackenzie.html">Spuds MacKenzie</a> ）。几个月后，在一个播客上，她讨论了她对吸引新受众和让品牌形象不那么“不友好”的兴趣，希望扭转一个衰落的品牌。在试图履行吸引新客户的使命时，她遇到了一些受众（或者至少是其中的一部分），他们不愿意接受使品牌更具包容性的改变。 （在寻求评论时，百威淡啤的母公司安海斯-布希公司发来了百威淡啤现任营销副总裁托德艾伦的一份声明，强调“人们希望我们回到我们最擅长的事情上：成为轻松享受。”他说，该品牌当前的战略“实际上是为了重申百威淡啤在人们生活中所扮演的角色。”安海斯-布希发言人补充说，到 2023 年，百威淡啤仍将是美国顶级啤酒品牌。）<br><br>饮料行业可能会不断变化——或者至少不断尝试改变——以适应这一时刻。对于许多酒精品牌来说，这可能看起来像是在混合物中添加苏打水和其他罐装美食。安海斯-布希现在拥有苏打水、罐装鸡尾酒和硬茶品牌。 2020 年，Molson Coors Brewing Company 进行了一次引人注目的品牌重塑：现在更名为 Molson Coors

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> 《大西洋月刊》的照片插图。资料来源：可口可乐公司/弗吉尼亚联邦大学。</figcaption></figure> “其实我们有<em>星空</em>。”柜台服务员说道。今年初春，我点了一杯柠檬汽水。我想要雪碧，但被告知这家百事可乐商店有 Sierra Mist。但等等，它也没有这个，因为百事可乐刚刚<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.news10.com/news/pepsi-dumps-sierra-mist-debuts-new-lemon-lime-soda-to-compete-with-sprite/">取消了</a>其已有 22 年历史的柠檬青柠品牌，并用一个新品牌取而代之：Starry。我想要一颗星星吗？我猜是这样的。有什么区别？我不知道；它尝起来像柠檬苏打水，这种味道太普通了，无法评论。<br><br>但是等等：为什么“柠檬-酸橙”这个组合如此普通？柠檬和酸橙都是酸柑橘，但很少有其他包装或制备的食品或饮料将两者放在一起。让我们面对现实吧：将柠檬和酸橙挤到炸玉米饼上，或将它们烤成酸橙和柠檬馅饼是不正常的。雪碧、7up、Sierra Mist 或 Starry 的味道真的像这些水果的混合吗？或者，正如可口可乐有时对雪碧口味的描述那样，“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scholarscompass.vcu.edu/brandcenter_icons/265/">柠檬</a>味”仅仅是一种营销噱头，欺骗了我、你和整个世界？<br><br>为了寻找答案，我踏上了柑橘和苏打水历史的旅程，并从我的旅行中了解到，柠檬酸橙与其说是一种味道，不如说是一种原型，是一种明亮、充满活力的解毒剂，可以消除炎热和迟缓，通过令人兴奋的媒介传递出来。碳酸化。事实上，自 18 世纪人造碳酸水问世以来，某种柠檬酸橙味就一直伴随着我们。你可能会说，这是汽水机里的幽灵。<br><br>到 1929 年秋天，查尔斯·莱珀·格里格 (Charles Leiper Grigg) 制作软饮料的尝试已经失败了。他的橙子汽水，Howdy，已经被 Orange Crush 压碎了。 7up 是他的后续作品，并取得了巨大的成功。从一开始，它就是柠檬酸橙口味的——格里格的组合后来占据了主导地位。从这个意义上来说，雪碧、塞拉·米斯特和星空也是他的孩子。<br><br>正是创新的好时机。 20 年代，改进的装瓶技术、可靠的瓶盖和现代制冷技术使苏打水首次成为可行的包装商品。爵士时代有抱负的软饮料设计师看到了泡沫中的美元，并互相绊倒，以创造下一件大事。治疗功效是一个天然的卖点：长期以来，碳酸矿泉水本身就被认为具有治疗作用——矿泉水是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/12/gettin-fizzy-with-it/510470/">最初的水疗中心</a>——街角商店将它们与药物融合在一起。这就是约翰·彭伯顿 (John Pemberton) 将兴奋剂可卡因和可乐果放入他的可口可乐混合物中的原因，可口可乐于 1886 年首次推出。百事可乐之所以如此命名，是因为它被认为可以缓解消化不良。格里格在他的饮料中加入的提振情绪的锂——最初被称为 Bib-Label 锂化柠檬酸橙苏打水——也遵循了这一传统。<br><br>但他的混合物的另一半——柠檬酸橙——也继承了传统。这种味道的精髓，即舌头上的鲜明亮度，至少可以追溯到 1772 年，当时英国化学家 Joseph Priestley 出版了他的<em>《用固定空气浸渍水的指南》</em> ，这是第一本有影响力的人工制造碳酸水<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/bs6kgbcq">手册</a>。继承了天然温泉水的健康益处，普里斯特利希望通过一种方法赢得英国海军部的支持，通过用固定空气浸渍海水来改善海上饮用的水。即使没有添加香料，碳酸水也<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/04/soda-carbonated-drinks-physiological-aversion-pain/673716/">含有碳酸</a>，除了嘶嘶声之外，还具有温和的味道：纯合成苏打水具有柑橘的感觉。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/04/soda-carbonated-drinks-physiological-aversion-pain/673716/">阅读：碳酸水会引起身体疼痛吗？</a><br><br>普里斯特利在他关于人工碳酸化的论文中，论证了苏打水是治疗或预防坏血病的一种方法，部分原因是它可以防止潮湿、纪律不严和有害饮食（以及其他因素）引起的体液“腐败”。 ）。人们开始认识到柑橘类水果也可以达到这一目的，但根据食品历史学家兼太平洋大学教授肯·阿尔巴拉 (Ken Albala) 的说法，没有人在柑橘类水果、维生素 C 和明亮的酸性风味之间建立科学联系。 100年左右。<br><br>在那个世纪，苏打水的库存将会上升。药剂师和苏打水罐将碳酸水和调味料混合在一起，既可以愉悦味觉，又可以治疗常见疾病。柠檬水很受欢迎，还有根、香料和水果的味道。其中一些药店将柠檬和酸橙混合成苏打水，然后又在许多当地分销的瓶装苏打水中混合，当格里格凭借 7up 大获成功时，这些瓶装苏打水已经上市。<br><br>但即便如此，为什么呢？ “不知道！” 《菲兹<em>：汽水如何震撼世界》一书</em>的作者特里斯坦·多诺万告诉我<em>。</em>这种饮料口味搭配“似乎一直存在”。尽管今天看起来很常见，但柠檬酸橙在历史上曾经是异常的。柠檬和酸橙有亲缘关系，都是酸味的、体积较小的柑橘类水果，果皮呈<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/02/what-color-tennis-ball-green-yellow/523521/">网球色</a>。但在人类美食的漫长历史中，两者很少同时出现。尝试说出一道同时使用柠檬<em>和</em>酸橙的经典菜肴吗？阿尔巴拉想不出一个。同样，柠檬和酸橙是鸡尾酒中常见的混合料和装饰物，但通常不在一起使用——gimlet 是酸橙饮料；gimlet 是酸橙饮料；汤姆·柯林斯 (Tom Collins) 是个柠檬人。<br><br>烹饪科学家兼包装食品顾问阿里·布扎里 (Ali Bouzari) 指出，一些伊朗食品，例如烤羊肉串的鸡肉，可能会用洋葱、藏红花、盐、柠檬和酸橙腌制。他还想到了秘鲁美食，例如，在准备酸橘汁腌鱼时，可能会使用这两种水果。但布扎里承认，这些例外可能只能证明这一规则：柠檬和酸橙并不是常见的烹饪伴侣，即使在这两种水果生长的地区的菜肴中也是如此。<br><br>至少<em>天然</em>柠檬和酸橙的情况是这样。布扎里告诉我，人造水果调味剂自格里格时代及之前就一直很流行，尤其是酸橙，当时作为一种调味剂比水果更容易找到。 <em>《苏打水和碳酸饮料：全球历史》一书</em>的作者朱迪思·莱文 (Judith Levin) 表示，一些早期的“酸橙”苏打水实际上只是柠檬汽水，之所以如此命名，是“因为酸橙更美味”。如果真正使用酸橙调味剂，则该产品可能会令人恶心。即使在今天，糖浆或提取物中也更容易产生柠檬味。 “在我闻到的每一百个石灰样本中，”布扎里告诉我，“至少有 80 个闻起来像清洁产品。”他将这些称为“奇怪的弗兰肯酸橙”口味，并表示他发现它们“非常时髦”。他说，一个追求新奇的挑剔的苏打调香师可能会添加柠檬来掩盖假酸橙的汗味，尽管他承认这个想法完全是猜测。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/the-sad-truth-about-seltzer/433947/">阅读：关于苏打水的悲伤真相</a><br><br>也许格里格对口味的选择是事后才想到的。他的产品的主要吸引力可能是锂，一种精神活性药物。 （7up“消除了抱怨中的‘哎哟’，”苏打水的早期口号之一这样说道。）有没有可能，格里格仍然因与 Howdy 的经历而沉迷于柑橘味，只是选择了柠檬和酸橙来加倍头韵， <em>Lithiated柠檬酸橙</em>？<br><br>这是不可能知道的。我与德克萨斯州韦科 Dr. Pepper 博物馆的藏品经理 Rachael Nadeau Johnson 进行了交谈，该博物馆还收藏了与母公司其他品牌相关的材料，包括 Squirt、A&amp;W 和 7up。她说，一些证据表明格里格在最后一刻加入了锂，但“关于早年的数据并不多。”<br><br>不管怎样，格里格的时机肯定有帮助。柠檬水中的有益健康的柠檬与仍然非法的杜松子酒中的酸橙相遇，锂让每个人都感觉良好。美国需要它：格里格推出后不久，股市崩盘，国家陷入大萧条。一瓶冷 7up 的有点明亮的酸度感觉很好，很好。<br><br><p align="center"></p><em>感觉很好</em>是苏打水卖家销售的产品。 “享受口渴”、“这是真实的东西”、“你是百事可乐一代”、“清爽的暂停”：加糖汽水要想成功，它必须味道好，但也必须具有说服力消费者选择它而不是任何其他大致相同的可用选项。产品设计很重要，但品牌和营销也必不可少。 “这一切都是协同作用的，”饮料营销公司研究部总经理加里·亨普希尔 (Gary Hemphill) 告诉我。 “你必须全力以赴。” （我为这篇报道联系的所有饮料品牌，包括百事可乐、可口可乐、Keurig Dr. Pepper 和 National Beverage Corp.，要么没有回应，要么拒绝与我交谈。）<br><br> 1929 年 7up 出现后，柠檬酸橙类别很快就根深蒂固。纳多·约翰逊说，这种饮料在大萧条时期非常成功，可能是作为酒精的替代品，也可能是作为盗版酒的混合剂。禁酒令结束后，七杯鸡尾酒食谱书籍激增。 （Nadeau Johnson 向我描述的一个配方鼓励你不必混合你的饮料，因为 7up 的气泡会自己混合。） 但这个品牌摇摇欲坠，到 20 世纪 50 年代末似乎已经过时了；看到机遇，百事可乐公司推出了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.retroist.com/p/teem-soda-was-delicious">Teem</a> ，可口可乐公司推出了雪碧。 7up 以反主流文化为主题的广告活动进行了反击，口号是“The Uncola”。百事可乐的 Slice <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1984/06/11/business/advertising-new-pepsi-soft-drink.html">出现</a>于 1984 年，随后又出现在 2000 年的 Sierra Mist，但都没有发展出 7up 或 Sprite 那样的强烈自我意识。 Starry 太新了，无法评判，但百事公司似乎正在用色彩鲜艳的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90836211/pepsi-new-gen-z-soda-starry-generation-marketing-pepsico">Z 世代乐观主义</a>吸引力来塑造该产品，也许是为了重新夺回被温和口味的苏打水迷失的新一代百事可乐。<br><br>这让我想知道：为什么这些品牌会成功？是什么让人们选择柠檬酸橙苏打水，无论它叫什么名字，而不是可乐、根汁汽水或橙子汽水？亨普希尔不知道——也许是品种，或者人口统计，或者地区偏好，或者谁知道还有什么。<br><br>与我交谈过的每个人似乎都认为柠檬汽水与夏天有关，或者与缓解夏日炎热有关。所有苏打水品牌都被宣传为“清爽”，阿尔巴拉的这一特点与碳酸软饮料固有的酸度有关。正如他所说，它是“某种东西穿过你的味觉的方式”。柠檬和酸橙口味本身就具有相同的效果。浓郁的酱汁或辣味通常与酸味相平衡，酸味通常来自柠檬和酸橙。像黄瓜一样，这些水果很凉。<br><br>尽管柠檬酸橙的名字看似具有描述性，但它的味道却很难描述。在写这个故事的过程中品尝饮料时，我不确定柠檬酸橙苏打水的味道是否像柠檬<em>或</em>酸橙。就是脆、凉、薄、轻。为什么？布扎里告诉我一种叫做混合抑制的现象。我们的大脑同时考虑的事情越多，它们就越模糊。在某些情况下，这会产生混乱（一种混乱的味道），但在其他情况下，它可以澄清：“热带”不是芒果、番石榴或冰镇果汁朗姆酒——它只是热带。激浪的味道更刺鼻，不太橙子味，业内人士称之为“重柑橘味”，这是另一个例子。混合浆果也是如此。它不是蓝莓、草莓或覆盆子，甚至不是所有这些的混合体，而是一种浓郁的深色混合物。你知道，混合浆果。<br><br><p align="center"></p> “柠檬酸橙更多的是一种氛围，而不是一种风味，”布扎里总结道。它是一种姿态、一种建议、一种概念或一种想法。一旦你以这种方式理解了柠檬酸橙，作为一种情感反应而不是一种味道，一股苏打水的气氛就会从薄雾中浮现出来。布扎里提出，一方面是我们的主角柠檬酸橙，它具体化了脆感——普里斯特利在碳酸水中识别出的“酸味”。另一方面，它的反面是：可乐的浓郁、黑暗的复杂性——泥土的、辛辣的、温暖的。它也不是一种味道，而是一种感觉——“就是可乐！”中间是固定口味（根汁汽水、姜汁汽水）以及百搭口味（Dr. Brown&#39;s Cel-Ray、Mountain Dew）。但在整个范围内，许多苏打水都富含柑橘味，使它们与柠檬酸橙联系在一起。虽然名牌苏打水的配方是严格保密的， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Grace-Oby-Obodozie-Ofoegbu/publication/301257094_Essential_Oils_as_Flavors_in_Carbonated_Cola_and_Citrus_Soft_Drinks/links/5cd1e21da6fdccc9dd938783/Essential-Oils-as-Flavors-in-Carbonated-Cola-and-Citrus-Soft-Drinks.pdf">但众所周知，</a>可乐是用柑橘油、香料和香草生产的。在与可乐相邻的 Dr. Pepper 中也能感受到类似的味道。 （顺便说一句，Dr. Pepper 是一种“胡椒”饮料。我希望我有时间进一步解释。）<br><br>美国人对苏打水的排斥已经有一段时间了——亨普希尔表示，自 2004 年以来，总体消费量下降了 21%。但苏打水仍然占据了饮料市场的很大一部分；因此，它提供了发展共同品味的最广泛的途径之一。当然，品味是指味道，但也可以是更广泛的爱好，比如成为雪碧男或 7up 女孩的吸引力。 “营销全在你的脑子里，”布扎里说，“但无论如何，这就是所有风味的所在。”<br><br>所有这一切在一个多世纪以来一直如此，但细节逐渐淡入流行生活的熟悉之中。百事可乐新款柠檬汽水 Starry 的奇怪而突然的<em>事实</em>帮助我看到了汽水更深层次的真相。柠檬汽水不是一个需要创新的产品，而只是一个迭代的产品。布扎里告诉我，这是爵士乐的标准。每家饮料公司的产品系列中都必须有一款，而作为饮用者的您必须能够认出它。不仅仅是因为它的味道，而且作为一个概念，可以帮助您确定哪种饮料在特定时刻适合您。柠檬酸橙在这种无意识的计算中扮演着特殊的角色，因为所有苏打水都是酸性的，而且因为人工碳酸化本身一直被柠檬和酸橙的幽灵所困扰。<br><br></div>

Moses），他在创建纽约市公共泳池方面发挥了重要作用。摩西是公共游泳的坚定倡导者。他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://kermitproject.org/newdeal/pdf/1934a.html">在 1934 年写道</a>：“可以毫不夸张地说，大量城市居民的健康、幸福、效率和秩序，尤其是在夏季，受到是否有足够的洗浴设施的极大影响。” 。<br><br>事实上，游泳确实对身心健康有重要的好处。也许今年夏天最重要的是：在炎热的天气里，将自己浸入冷水中可以快速降低体温。游泳是一种很棒的有氧运动，而且它比许多其他提高心率的活动更容易伤害关节。有氧运动可以减轻压力，尤其是游泳已被<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/swimming/swimmers/health_benefits_water_exercise.html#ten">证明可以改善情绪</a>。在一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/lim2.12">初步研究</a>中，在寒冷的海洋中游泳所减少的抑郁感比在海滩上观看的效果高出 10 倍。在另一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://casereports.bmj.com/content/2018/bcr-2018-225007.abstract">案例研究</a>中，一名患有难治性抑郁症的女性每周在开放水域游泳一次后，其症状得到了显着改善。<br><br>我从小就喜欢游泳，是父亲教我的，直到现在，每当我心情不好的时候，我都会条件反射地去水里。我一直认为游泳对情绪的提振作用完全是运动和由此产生的内啡肽在我大脑中大量分泌的结果——我可能会从艰苦的举重训练或长跑中获得同样的效果。但事实是，研究发现游泳可以提升你的情绪，往往涉及<em>与其他人一起游泳。</em>也许社交接触也是魔法的一部分。<br><br><a

20 世纪早期凉亭，还有一个供人们休息的广场。当游泳池在流感大流行的第一年重新开放时，该市最初暂停了室外游泳池的成人开放时间，转而支持自由、狂欢的游泳。当我参观时，孩子们高兴地尖叫，嬉戏，把看到的每个人都溅到水里。一些认真的游泳者徒劳地试图找到一条泳道进行锻炼，但我主要是和孩子们一起划水，享受凉爽的水。<br><br>当我设法找到一条车道跑几圈后，一群孩子走近我，问我是否可以教他们如何做空翻。我们在水中练习翻筋斗，玩得很开心。关门时间，救生员将不情愿的人群赶出泳池后，我和其他游泳者一起站在室外的冷水淋浴下，被这一切奇怪的亲密感震惊了：我们在这里，完全陌生，是一群不同的人类，几乎赤身裸体，站在一起玩得很开心。每个人都相处得很融洽。<br><br>这就是公共泳池的全部优点：在周围有很多人的情况下锻炼身体、消暑。在西南地区，气温连续几周攀升至 100 华氏度以上，这些设施是一条生命线。在其他地方，它们可以使一个孤独、不舒服的夏日和一个快乐的夏日有所不同。然而，由于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/22/business/public-pools-extreme-heat/index.html">预算削减</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/06/lifeguard-shortage-pools-history/674340/">救生员短缺</a>，如今能够轻松使用市政游泳池的美国人越来越少。<br><br> <a

年，当摩西赞扬公共泳池的优点时，美国正处于修建泳池的热潮中。许多泳池都是种族隔离的，所以不是每个人都可以一起游泳，但随着时间的推移，它们变成了熔炉，尽管城市<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/history/article/public-swimming-pools-still-haunted-by-segregation-legacy">在维护方面的投资较少</a>，许多白人居民涌向私人设施。<br><br>现在，随着美国城市的热潮不断升温，摩西斯关于社区游泳在公共卫生和幸福方面的作用的想法比以往任何时候都更加重要。如果今年夏天您可以去公共游泳池（即使您也<em>可以</em>使用后院游泳池），请务必尝试一下。当然，当你完成后，外面仍然很热，但在你擦干后，清爽和放松的感觉会持续很长时间。<br><br></div>

This all allegedly occurred amid the FBI&#39;s attempts to secure the return of a huge quantity of classified documents that Trump took from the White House—a frustrated effort that culminated in the government&#39;s execution of a search warrant at the property on <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/08/politics/mar-a-lago-search-warrant-fbi-donald-trump/index.html">August 8</a> .<br><br> The superseding indictment also adds a new count under the Espionage Act related to a document marked <span class="smallcaps">top secret</span> and identified as a “presentation concerning military activity in a foreign country,” which Trump is described as waving around to people without security clearances at his Bedminster, New Jersey, club. It also charges de Oliveira with repeatedly lying to the FBI when asked about his knowledge of the boxes stored and moved around at Mar-a-Lago.<br><br> The case is only getting more damning for Trump.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/trump-indictment/674345/">David A. Graham: This indictment is different</a><br><br> Recall that the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://d3i6fh83elv35t.cloudfront.net/static/2023/06/trump-indictment.pdf">original indictment</a> alleged that in May 2022, Nauta removed—at Trump&#39;s direction—64 boxes of documents from “the Storage Room” at Mar-a-Lago. Nauta removed 11 more boxes on June 1, according to the indictment. Several <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-indictment-pictures-photos-documents-boxes-mar-a-lago-bathroom/">photographs</a> depicting stacks of disheveled boxes—one with what looks like a copy machine nearby—were reproduced in the indictment. The new obstruction charges involve the storage room and nearby security cameras, which could have picked up footage of people moving boxes after Trump&#39;s lawyers claimed to the FBI <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-lawyer-christina-bobb-speaks-federal-investigators-mar-lago-case-rcna51459">on June 3</a> , in a certified statement, that Trump had returned everything in his possession.<br><br> The superseding indictment alleges that Trump orchestrated a failed attempt to destroy the surveillance-video footage <i>the day after</i> he learned from his lawyer, on June 22, that they were expecting a grand-jury subpoena for production of “any and all surveillance records, videos, images, photographs and/or CCTV from internal cameras,” including from the “ground floor (basement).” On June 23, Trump called de Oliveira and spoke with him for 24 minutes. The subpoena was issued on June 24. The same day, a staff member texted Nauta, who was at Bedminster, that Trump wanted to see him. In less than two hours, Nauta changed his plans to travel to Illinois, instead heading to Mar-a-Lago. On June 25, Nauta and de Oliveira went to the ground-floor basement, “with a flashlight through the tunnel where the Storage Room was located, and observed and pointed out surveillance cameras.”<br><br> On June 27, after confirming that the club&#39;s IT director, referred to as “Employee 4” in the indictment, was available, de Oliveira walked with that person through the basement tunnel, where they had a conversation meant to “remain between the two of them.” De Oliveira told him that “&#39;the boss&#39; wanted the server deleted.” Employee 4 refused, saying that he would not “have the rights to do that.” De Oliveira responded, “What are we going to do?”<br><br> Later that day, according to the indictment, Nauta and de Oliveira “walked through the bushes on the northern edge of The Mar-a-Lago Club property to meet.” Approximately two hours later, Trump called de Oliveira “and they spoke for approximately three and a half minutes.” Later in the summer, two weeks after the FBI conducted its search (it obtained the surveillance footage in July, and the warrant was issued in early August), Nauta called another Trump employee, saying, “Someone just wants to make sure Carlos is good.” The employee responded that de Oliveira “was loyal” to Trump, who called de Oliveira “the same day” and told him that he&#39;d get him an attorney.<br><br> A few things jump out from this narrative, all of which are bad for Trump. The attempt to erase the video footage occurred in direct response to a grand-jury subpoena for the video footage—not prophylactically, routinely, by mistake, or for some other noncriminal reason. This is a big deal for purposes of proving the crime of obstruction, and Trump&#39;s role and influence in the effort to destroy potentially incriminating evidence of interest to a federal grand jury is unmistakable. The fact pattern also bolsters the government&#39;s case that Trump&#39;s efforts to induce others to hide and tamper with evidence were made “knowingly” and “with intent” under the relevant obstruction statute, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1512">18 USC § 1512(b)(2)</a> . (The new Espionage Act charge also blows apart Trump&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/classified-docs-case-trump-adds-bravado-claim-evolving-story-rcna91563">claim</a> to the Fox News host Bret Baier that there “was not a document per se” involved in the audio recording of him <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/06/26/donald-trump-audio-recording-iran-documents/">discussing</a> what appear to be military war plans with folks lacking security clearances.) Meanwhile, the superseding indictment rests on a stream of corroborating evidence—including, according to the indictment, surveillance-video footage; the testimony of several employees; and a trove of text messages and phone records between the key players, among them Trump himself.<br><br> The Mar-a-Lago case is one of two criminal trials Trump is facing so far—the other was brought by the Manhattan district attorney over alleged financial wrongdoing—with at least <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/trump-legal-issues-two-more-174329060.html">two more</a> possibly impending, including one stemming from Trump&#39;s involvement in the violent attempt to thwart the peaceful transition of presidential power on January 6, 2021, and another out of Fulton County, Georgia, over his recorded effort to sway the Georgia secretary of state to “find” enough votes to swing that state into his electoral column. In all of these cases, prosecutors&#39; task is unique in that the defendant is a former president of the United States and the front-runner for the Republican nomination in 2024—both historical firsts. Criminal juries must be unanimous in Manhattan and in federal court, so Trump&#39;s legal team need only secure a single loyalist who will not convict in order to achieve an acquittal.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trumps-january-6-target-letter-jack-smith/674738/">David A.

Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> More than a decade ago, in a prescient <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/long-live-the-web/">essay</a> for <em>Scientific American</em> , the inventor of the World Wide Web denounced what Facebook and other tech giants were doing to his signature invention. “Why should you care?” Tim Berners-Lee wrote at the time. “Because the Web is yours.” These companies, he warned, were restructuring the web itself, turning an expanse of interconnected websites all built on the same open infrastructure into a series of “fragmented islands” where users were kept hostage.<br><br> On Facebook&#39;s island, he wrote, people give over their entire digital life for the chance to connect with their friends, but have no way to transfer their information to any other platform. Once captive, users upload photos, add friends, send messages, click ads, and react to posts, all the while leaving a trail of information from which Facebook can profit. The more they do these things, the harder leaving becomes—so much of people&#39;s digital life is nested in Facebook, rather than in Facebook&#39;s rivals. The logic extends to other tech platforms too. On Apple&#39;s island, Berners-Lee explained, iTunes users can tap into an immense catalog of music but can&#39;t easily share it with anyone. “You are trapped in a single store, rather than being on the open marketplace,” Berners-Lee wrote. “For all the store&#39;s wonderful features, its evolution is limited to what one company thinks up.”<br><br> That was 2010. Since then, with the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history">aggressive development</a> of Apple&#39;s App Store, Facebook&#39;s strategic acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, and many other protectionist moves that have made tech&#39;s most dominant companies even more powerful, the web&#39;s fragmented islands—or “walled gardens,” as Berners-Lee also called them—have grown only more secluded.<br><br> But lately, a funny thing has happened. As tech giants face mounting antitrust scrutiny and try to navigate the development of generative AI technology, the most powerful companies in Silicon Valley are attempting to signal their open-web bona fides. Meta, the company formerly known as Facebook, has become a particularly prominent voice. Last week, it  announced that it was partnering with Microsoft on the release of its latest large language model, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ai.meta.com/llama/">Llama 2</a> , which it is making openly available for free. That means that, unlike its nearest rival, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/gpt4-release-rumors-hype-future-iterations/673396/">GPT-4</a> , which users can pay to license from OpenAI, developers will be able to download Llama 2&#39;s code, tinker with it, and build new things on top of it, dramatically expanding access to generative AI technology—and potentially leaving OpenAI out to dry in the process. Around the same time, Meta announced that its Twitter copycat, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/meta-threads-social-media-platform-death-rebirth/674638/">Threads</a> , will eventually be interoperable with small competing social platforms such as Mastodon and WordPress.<br><br> If any of this sounds like the first step into a wonderful new era of ungated collaboration, it&#39;s not. These gestures toward openness aren&#39;t the product of some sudden, soul-cleansing instinct to cede power. Quite the opposite. Lowering the garden walls ever so slightly works in service of entrenching Meta&#39;s power and ensuring that the company is just as indispensable to the next era of computing as it was to the last one.<br><br> In his Facebook post <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/pfbid0fPf17FPKy8x93DPNrLGM99RrXguYqbPDhuWBnvmNeAjuHtAeS6rGaGN41jgfhgGrl">announcing</a> the Llama 2 release, Mark Zuckerberg co-opted the gospel of openness, arguing that it would “unlock more progress” and improve safety for generative AI more broadly by enabling more developers to build these technologies and identify potential problems and fixes. It&#39;s not exactly a novel idea: Some of AI&#39;s most prominent ethicists have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dair-institute.org/blog/letter-statement-March2023/">repeatedly raised concerns</a> about black-box AI models being concentrated in the hands of just a few multibillion-dollar companies. But Zuckerberg is decidedly not one of AI&#39;s most prominent ethicists. He is, instead, a person who not only runs one of those multibillion-dollar companies, but who is also responsible for building and ruthlessly defending one of the internet&#39;s most infamous walled gardens.<br><br> This is the same company that has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.protocol.com/nyu-facebook-researchers-scraping">prohibited</a> academics from scraping data from its products for the purposes of research, neutralized competitors by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/06/house-antitrust-committee-facebook-monopoly-buys-kills-competitors.html">acquiring them</a> , and actively made it harder for rival platforms to use Facebook&#39;s features. When the video platform Vine wanted users to be able to find their Facebook friends through its app, Zuckerberg <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents">personally</a> approved the order ensuring that they couldn&#39;t. When people started posting links to Instagram photos on Twitter, Facebook <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764539/instagram-twitter-timeline-image-preview-feud">prevented</a> the links from generating full image previews, rendering them mostly useless for nearly a decade until the policy changed.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/social-media-centralism-fediverse/674041/">Read: Ben Franklin would have loved Bluesky</a><br><br> It isn&#39;t difficult to understand why Meta would be flirting with a more open approach. For starters, giving away Llama 2 for free will help the company speed up adoption to compete with OpenAI. Besides, offering free access to powerful tools and then figuring out how to make gobs of money from them later is kind of Meta&#39;s thing: It did the same with Facebook before ever charging advertisers a dime. The idea that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/internet-archive-decentralized-web-web3-brewster-kahle/671647/">social media should be decentralized</a> —enabling different networks to plug into one another, rather than hoarding every user for themselves—is also having something of a moment among the extremely online. That&#39;s mostly due to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-musk-x-rebrand/674818/">Twitter&#39;s Elon Musk–induced implosion</a> , which has sent former Twitter users on a search for alternatives en masse. If the internet is indeed transforming from a series of fragmented islands into something more like an archipelago, Zuckerberg is already staking his turf.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/10/internet-archive-decentralized-web-web3-brewster-kahle/671647/">Read: The battle for the soul of the web</a><br><br> To Meta&#39;s credit, as Zuckerberg dutifully noted in his post, the company does have a history with open-source development of machine-learning technology. And the long-standing walls around just about every other part of its business, including its billions of users, arguably have offered some benefits beyond profits. At least in theory, those barriers help the company protect user privacy and enforce its standards and policies, thereby taming some of the chaos it has unleashed on the world. Meta&#39;s enforcement record, however, has been inconsistent at best—and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/12/facebook-doomsday-machine/617384/">utterly lacking at worst</a> .<br><br> Despite this already lax policing, what Meta is doing now with Threads and Llama 2 will make enforcing its own rules even more difficult for the company. If Threads becomes interoperable with other platforms such as Mastodon—allowing posts to flow back and forth between servers—Meta will face rule breakers from a whole bunch of other networks, including ones where just about anything goes. (So-called federated social media is already home to an astonishing volume of child-abuse material, according to a new <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/news/addressing-child-exploitation-federated-social-media">report</a> from the Stanford Internet Observatory.) With Llama 2, Meta has invested in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://about.fb.com/news/2023/07/llama-2/">AI guardrails</a> designed to prevent the worst abuses, but as has been the case for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/24/business/ai-generated-explicit-images.html">other open-source models</a> , once developers have their hands on it, people will inevitably find ways to jump those guardrails, and Meta will have limited control over what those people do on the other side.<br><br> All of this can seem like a moderation nightmare for Meta—until you consider that the company might use its newfound excitement about abdicating control as an excuse to abdicate even more responsibility. If Meta&#39;s open to everyone, then maybe its problems are everyone else&#39;s.<br><br> Like Berners-Lee, many people deeply believe in the dream of an open web. But the danger right now is that the <em>performance</em> of this belief can easily cover up a canny business strategy. Despite its public framing, Llama 2 isn&#39;t quite what purists would call open source. In the fine print, its community agreement stipulates that although most developers can freely access the model, anyone with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/">more than 700 million monthly users</a> will have to get a license from Meta first.

Speculation abounded as to why Musk would trade a well-known brand for a letter typically associated with rejection and porn: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-rebrand-paypall-x-sounded-like-porn-site-twitter-2023-7">spite</a> , maybe. Or maybe—the most absurd theory, and therefore the most likely—the man who had named his car models “S,” “3,” “X,” and “Y” was doing it, once again, for the lols. Soon after Twitter became X, employees <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/technology/twitter-x-elon-musk.html">reported</a> , the conference rooms of its headquarters were rechristened. The staffers Musk hasn&#39;t yet fired can now plan the future of democratized conversation from a meeting room named “s3Xy.”<br><br> X was released, as it happened, the same weekend that the <em>Barbie</em> movie was. The coincidence was eloquent. <em>Barbie</em> is a film about its namesake, definitely, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/">an exploration of impossible womanhood</a> . But it is also a film about Ken—a Ken who, in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-greta-gerwig-interview/674817/">director Greta Gerwig&#39;s rendering</a> , sheds his status as Barbie&#39;s bland accessory to become … a power-addled man-child determined to turn the world into his plaything. No element of <em>Barbie</em> ’s aggressive marketing campaign could have bought the relevance created by a 52-year-old tech titan who, when he is not moving fast and/or breaking things, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-humor-jokes-over-years-titter-420-69-2023-4">amuses himself</a> by finding new ways to write “69” into the public record.<br><br> Americans live under gerontocracy, many pundits have argued: Too many of our leaders, having tasted power and then spent decades consolidating it, refuse to cede their spoils to anybody else. The broader truth is even more lamentable, though, because it involves leaders who, unable to contend with power&#39;s responsibilities, treat our future as their toy. Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have spent weeks fueling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/01/technology/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-cage-match.html">speculation</a> that they will settle their business differences by way of a televised cage match. Americans gave our nuclear codes to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/infantilization-of-a-president/542613/">a Brioni-swaddled toddler</a> . We may well <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/trump-2024-election-republican-primary-nomination-opponents/673882/">do it again</a> . We live in the thrall of impetuous boy-kings. No fictional figure has captured the absurdity of that situation, and the tragedy of it, better than a doll who looks like a man but inflicts himself on the world with a boy&#39;s impish glee. Ken demands attention. He throws tantrums. He sows chaos. He threatens the whole order of things. He is the plastic core of <em>Barbie</em> ’s world—and a bleached-blond satire of ours.<br><br> Barbie Land is, allegedly, a place of childish dreams, safe and happy and sterile and pink. “Girl power,” in the land of the dolls, is not a well-lit lie; it is, on the contrary, the only truth that exists—the scaffolding that supports every wall-less Dream House. It shapes not only the Barbies&#39; professional lives (President Barbie, Physicist Barbie, Doctor Barbie) but also their sense of the world they occupy. The Barbies are self-confident and self-actualized and just generally delighted, and of course they are: They have never had reason to be otherwise. In Barbie Land, the Barbies are fond of reminding themselves that every day is “the best day ever.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/">Read: What&#39;s the matter with Barbie?</a><br><br> There are Kens in Barbie Land, but they are, like the doll himself, variously decorative and superfluous. Where do the Kens live? What Dream Cars do they drive? Such questions are moot. In a place that treats possessions as proxies for personal fulfillment, the Kens seem to have none. Nor, in a society that equates profession with identity, do they have apparent careers. The Kens do have a job, though: to serve as reliable extras in the Barbies&#39; shiny show. The Kens are there when they&#39;re needed. They&#39;re cheerful. They&#39;re patient. They&#39;re always ready to don sequins and smiles for an intricately choreographed dance number. They are, like pretty much everything else in Barbie Land, aggressively uncomplicated. They are also, as a result, extremely boring.<br><br> Except, that is, for one of them: the Ken who is paired, per the two-by-two logic of Barbie Land, with Stereotypical Barbie. This Ken, played—inhabited—by Ryan Gosling, chafes against his class status. Barbie Land may look like a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://collider.com/themyscira-wonder-woman-series-paradise-lost/">Paradise Island</a> –style matriarchy whose Amazons are 11 inches tall and molded of polyvinyl chloride; Ken, though, is a reminder of the brute limits of its utopia. The film&#39;s most obvious problem comes early on, when Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) finds herself afflicted by the assorted insults of the human condition (imperfectly browned toast, thoughts of death, cellulite). But Barbie Land&#39;s prefab perfections were imperfect well before Barbie&#39;s crisis. Ken bears the brunt of its errors. He is not merely Barbie&#39;s plaything; he is also the recipient of her casual cruelty. “You can go now,” Barbie tells him, flashing a smile as his face falls. Later: “I don&#39;t want you here.”<br><br> These are the types of lines that have earned <em>Barbie</em> , in the days since its release, some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/24/if-i-made-a-movie-that-treated-women-the-way-barbie-treats-men-feminists-would-want-me-executed/">indignant</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/22/barbie-attacked-right-wingers-anti-man-feminist-trash/">accusations</a> of man-hating and sexism and “toxic femininity.” What the criticisms miss, though—or perhaps ignore—is that irony might be present even in a film about toys. The dynamics of Barbie Land are both complicated and simple: Barbie, insulated in its confines, represents—in real-world terms—the beneficiaries of patriarchy. Ken represents, essentially, everybody else. Barbie, in her dismissals of Ken, doesn&#39;t mean to be mean; she treats him thoughtlessly because she has simply never considered that words—or anything, really—might cause hurt. She has never needed to. Comfort, in her society as in ours, is a luxury. The slogans of the human world—and the bleak dynamics that have transformed kindness and empathy from kindergarten lessons into political pleas—make no sense to those who cannot imagine other people&#39;s pain.<br><br> They make a lot of sense to Ken, though. He is, at the outset of the film, the most messily human feature of this plastic world, a tangle of need and hope and, eventually, rage. In the land of hard-set smiles, he winces. Surrounded by endless cheer, he aches. He senses that something is very much amiss. But sensing is all he can do. Barbie Land may have a president and a constitution and a supreme court, but it is, in practice, aggressively apolitical. (Politics is a response to humans and conflicts; Barbie Land allows neither.) And so, having no language or outlet for his frustrations—beleaguered, you might say, by a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-feminine-mystique-anniversary-betty-friedan/8751751?ean=9780393934656&amp;ref=&amp;source=IndieBound&amp;title=The+Feminine+Mystique%3A+A+Norton+Critical+Edition+%28Norton+Critical+Editions%29">problem that has no name</a> —Ken simply feels his way through his plight. His want leaves him afflicted with something else that is foreign in Barbie Land: vulnerability.<br><br> Much of <em>Barbie</em> ’s magic comes down to Robbie and Gosling and their ability, as actors, to blend the plastic and the human, the earnest and the camp. Robbie&#39;s performance, for its part, is a matter of distillation. It captures many of the elements that have made the Barbie doll both <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/tiny-shoulders-review-hulu/559277/">an enduring icon and an endless controversy</a> —among them her unattainable beauty, her blithe naivete, her whiteness, her thinness, her reminder that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/jeffrey-epstein-and-the-myth-of-the-underage-woman/596140/">even children are stalked by the shifting demands of womanhood</a> . Gosling finds similar nuance, but from the opposite direction: Ken is, infamously, a plus-one who is defined by his absence. Gosling fills in the blanks. And he does so by weaving one of the dolls&#39; elemental ironies—Barbie and Ken are teenagers who are routinely mistaken for adults—into his performance.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/jeffrey-epstein-and-the-myth-of-the-underage-woman/596140/">Read: The myth of the &#39;underage woman&#39;</a><br><br> Ken, in Gosling&#39;s rendering, lives in a stew of emotions that are always just beyond his control. He is by turns petulant and teeming with possibility, impulsive and self-conscious. Which is also to say that this chisel-jawed doll is, in many ways, a very typical adolescent. Barbie, newly beset by human-borne feeling, shocks herself by crying—first a single tear, and then a flood of them. Gosling&#39;s Ken cries too. But his discord has a stereotypically masculine edge. He erupts into anger. He feels entitled to sex, despite and because of his ignorance of it. He cares, deeply, what the other guys think of him. “You can&#39;t make me look uncool in front of Ken!” he wails at Barbie, panic flashing in his eyes.<br><br> Ken, in the film&#39;s early scenes, takes his tumult out on Barbie. There he is, radiating look-at-me longing. There he is, like Romeo with his poems or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GoH3M9Kb4g">Lloyd Dobler with his boom box</a> , turning love into a show. He orients his life around Barbie so thoroughly that, before long, he is becoming the one thing a Ken must not be in Barbie Land: a hindrance.<br><br> Ken resents his neediness as much as Barbie does. But Barbie Land offers him no other option. <em>She is everything; he&#39;s just Ken</em> . That is the way of this world. Gosling&#39;s performance channels all of that. And then, powerfully, it escalates the matter: Ken&#39;s need for Barbie becomes so consuming that it curdles into violence. Soon, his hopeful smiles are twisting into sneers. The stubbornness of his desire for Barbie—and his inability to accept her disinterest—begins to evoke the grim entitlements of the incel. His plight becomes everyone else&#39;s threat.<br><br> It&#39;s unsettling, the doll made dangerous. That&#39;s what makes it so effective. The bulk of the film finds Barbie and Ken on a journey that mimics adolescence: Having left the land of protection and play and easy dreams, they are plunged into the realities of the human world—and the hard transactions of adulthood. The dolls must navigate a place that has no shortage of language for its political condition: <em>patriarchy</em> , <em>marginalization</em> , <em>objectification</em> , <em>oppression</em> .<br><br> Ken loves it. Walking on a street in LA—clothed, through an accident of circumstance in the plot and inspired costuming choices beyond it, in fringe-covered Western wear—he begins to strut. He feels, for the first time, respected, admired, seen. Barbie, meanwhile, is the one made to feel—and then to fear—the vulnerabilities of her gender. One of <em>Barbie</em> ’s best jokes finds Ken, having returned to Barbie Land, playing her a song on his guitar—singing not <em>to</em> Barbie, he makes clear, but <em>at</em> her. Ken croons and crows, entranced by the romance of his gesture, holding Barbie&#39;s gaze and refusing to let it go. The absurdity of it all is punctured by the lyrics of the song he chooses—one that became, in the real world, a hit: <em>I wanna push you around, well I will, well I will / I wanna push you down, well I will, well I will</em> …<br><br> Adolescence is a time of extremes. And Ken, having experienced manhood in a man&#39;s world, reacts to his new situation with juvenile glee. Soaking up his surroundings as a child might—alive, always, to the images and messages around him—he intuits first that manliness is everything in the real world, and second, that manliness must involve horses. (Patriarchy, he concludes, is the system “where men on horses run everything.”) He is entranced by images of Rocky Balboa and Bill Clinton, captivated by the guys who high-five one another at the gym. Back in Barbie Land, importing the lessons he&#39;s learned from reality, he takes over Barbie&#39;s Dream House. His Mojo Dojo Casa House is a bachelor pad and a bar and, in its overall aesthetic, a tribute to John Wayne&#39;s influence on American tropes of masculinity. Its decor features, obviously, an abundance of horses.<br><br> Ken&#39;s excesses are funny, and foolish, and, except for the house-stealing stuff, pretty relatable. Like any teenager, Ken is figuring out who he is, and trying the world&#39;s possibilities on for size. But his immaturity is not contained, and this is its problem. His adolescent approach to the world, instead, inflicts itself on everyone else. Soon—a plot twist that, for anyone who has followed US politics in recent years, doubles as a twist of the knife—Ken is trying to rewrite Barbie Land&#39;s constitution.<br><br> There&#39;s an ominous kind of justice to Ken&#39;s attempts to inject himself into the political life of Barbie Land. It is a zero-sum solution to the problems of a zero-sum world. The Ken doll has been called, over the years, a “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/22/style/ken-barbie-doll-biography-cec/index.html">drip with seriously abridged genitalia</a> ,” “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a44285254/the-history-of-ken-barbie/">an uncomfortably freighted icon of anti-masculinity</a> ,” and—by Gosling, during <em>Barbie</em> ’s promotional tour—“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/entertainment/ryan-gosling-ken-barbie-doll-cec/index.html">an accessory, and not even one of the cool ones</a> .” When Ken was featured in 2010&#39;s <em>Toy Story 3</em> , he found himself on the receiving end of the following line: “You ascot-wearing pink-noser! You&#39;re not a toy … You&#39;re a purse with legs!”<br><br> The insult was made all the more insulting because it was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-H9-CLfOWg">delivered</a> by a tuber with detachable limbs and anger-management issues. But Mr. Potato Head was simply saying what everyone already knew: The defining fact of Ken is that Ken is defined by Barbie. That alone makes it hard not to feel bad for the guy. And for many of <em>Barbie</em> ’s viewers, his plight may feel extremely familiar. A key moment in the film, as my colleague Shirley Li <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">wrote</a> , comes from one of its human protagonists, Gloria (America Ferrera), who summons a life&#39;s worth of frustration into a speech about the challenges—and the utter irrationality—of being a woman in a world shaped by men. Another key moment, though, comes from Ken. It&#39;s near the end of the movie, and he&#39;s finally getting the one thing he&#39;s really wanted: Barbie is listening to him. He&#39;s telling her what it&#39;s like to be dimmed so that somebody else might shine. And then he adds the kicker: “It doesn&#39;t feel good, does it?”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">Read: The surprising key to understanding the</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/"><em>Barbie</em></a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">film</a><br><br> The critics who have accused <em>Barbie</em> of misandry might want to watch that moment, if indeed they ever watched it at all, once more. Ken&#39;s line gives punctuation, effectively, to Gloria&#39;s speech. And it does what our current political slogans beg us, fruitlessly, to do: It empathizes. Ken doesn&#39;t really want political power, he discovers; it&#39;s a lot of work. (Plus, disappointingly, horses are merely “men-extenders.”) What he really seeks is the power to figure out who he is on his own terms. Does Ken want Barbie at all? Would he, as the film hints, rather be paired with another Ken? What would he choose to be were his identity broader than Barbie and Beach?<br><br> Ken is, by the end of the film, not merely a doll who has known life in the human world; he is also a guy who understands what it&#39;s like to be treated as an extra in someone else&#39;s story. In him, the debates that shape—and limit—our political possibilities become elegantly straightforward. Ken is a person who is denied the full dignity of his personhood. That—whatever your worldview, whatever your particular circumstance, whatever your feelings about the word <em>patriarchy</em> —is a blatant form of injustice.<br><br> But Ken is also, at the story&#39;s conclusion, a guy who has escaped from his arrested development. He has come to embody one of <em>Barbie</em> ’s core ideas: that patriarchy is a profound form of immaturity. It causes childishness. It results from it too. Here is one reason for hope, though, as our very real men-children keep trying to remake the world into their Mojo Dojo Casa House: For Ken, immaturity becomes what it is for most people—a phase on the way to something better. Ken doesn&#39;t become human. He does, however, grow up.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 28 Jul 2023 13:10:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-ken/674852/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-ken/674852/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Alabama Is Defying the Supreme Court on Voting Rights]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The state&#39;s refusal to comply has been met with a revealing silence on the right. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6oRV8Ipn4UaqtOQz5THPJkziERo=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/alabama_final/original.jpg" alt="围绕不公正划分选区轮廓的阿拉巴马州边界图" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> Supreme Court rulings are meant to be the law of the land, but Alabama is taking its recent opinion on the Voting Rights Act as a mere recommendation.

After failing to get the Supreme Court to overturn Section 2, Alabama decided that following the law was optional.<br><br> Alabama&#39;s open rejection of a Supreme Court ruling comes in the midst of a conservative campaign accusing liberals of “delegitimizing” the Court by criticizing its lurch to the right and the coziness of the Republican-appointed justices <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/supreme-court-justice-thomas-harlan-crow-disclosure-law/673871/">with billionaire political donors</a> who have interests before the Court.<br><br> “This is another front in the political campaign to delegitimize the Supreme Court, with a goal of tarnishing its rulings and subjecting it to more political control,” <i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/supreme-court-ethics-reform-hearing-senate-democrats-john-roberts-clarence-thomas-ketanji-brown-jackson-sonia-sotomayor-d0304d65">editorialized in May</a> about Democratic hearings on potential ethics legislation. “Most of all, the Court is no longer a backstop legislature for progressives to impose policies they can&#39;t get through Congress.”<br><br> Whatever else this Court may be, it can now be fairly described as a backstop legislature for conservatives to impose policies they cannot get through Congress. Also, the Court hasn&#39;t had a liberal majority since the Nixon era, so conservative complaints that the Court was a “backstop legislature for progressives” are not an expression of opposition to “political control” over the Court, but a lament that Republican appointees possessed only a slim one-vote majority for most of that time, which meant they didn&#39;t get their preferred outcomes as often as they wanted. And the way that the conservative movement seized the Court was precisely by “tarnishing its rulings” for more than a half century. At one point, the right-wing legal martyr and originalist Robert Bork was so frustrated by the Court being insufficiently conservative <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/opinions/1997/03/16/bork-uncorked/086393bb-e61d-4751-8177-bb3147f58eca/">that he declared</a> , “As our institutional arrangements now stand, the Court can never be made a legitimate element of a basically democratic polity.” In the right&#39;s view, the judiciary was an “imperial judiciary,” an “out of control branch of government.”<br><br> Indeed, although it now accuses the Court&#39;s liberal critics of “delegitimization,” the <i>Journal</i> defends the current Court by saying it is merely undoing the “legal mistakes of recent decades.” What the Roberts Court&#39;s defenders truly fear is the political strength of a critique of the Court as overreaching and out of touch with the majority of the electorate, because as conservatives well understand, that is a critique that has the power to influence elections and ultimately shape the Court itself. They understand this because that is one reason the 6–3 right-wing majority on the Court <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/09/lie-about-supreme-court-everyone-pretends-believe/620198/">came to be in the first place</a> . This is why questioning the Court&#39;s legal reasoning and sweeping power is a privilege that must be exclusively reserved for conservatives.<br><br> The fear is clearly not that rogue actors will ignore the Court&#39;s rulings. If the pervasive right-wing alarm over liberal criticism of the Court as “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mediamatters.org/supreme-court/right-wing-media-accuse-left-trying-delegitimize-supreme-court-after-reporting-shows">delegitimizing</a> ” has been deafening, the conservative response to Alabama openly flouting the Court&#39;s ruling has been muted. The <em>Wall Street Journal</em> ’s editorial page, for example, so protective of the Court&#39;s “legitimacy,” when it comes to substantive public criticism, did not view Alabama&#39;s refusal to obey the justices <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/news/types/review-outlook-u-s?mod=opinion_major_strap_1">as an event worthy of comment</a> .<br><br> One would think that verbal criticism of powerful institutions, an essential part of life in any democracy, would be less an act of “delegitimization” than an open challenge to the rule of law. But Alabama is defying the rule of law in pursuit of conservative causes—more Republicans in Congress; voiding constitutional prohibitions on racial discrimination—and so it&#39;s fine.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/10/john-roberts-supreme-court-voting-rights-act/671239/">From the October 2022 issue: John Roberts&#39;s long game</a><br><br> All of this renders the <i>Journal</i> ’s hand-wringing rather ironic: It is clear the right that views the Court as a political instrument for imposing conservative policy, and when the Court fails to heed its obligation to do so, they can simply ignore it. This is consistent with the movement&#39;s Trumpist turn toward the belief that the legitimacy of any practice or institution—elections, fundamental freedoms, the state itself—is conferred not by the consent of the governed but by the consent of the right. You have an inalienable access to the franchise <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/12/voter-fraud/617354/">as long as you vote Republican</a> .

The Supreme Court&#39;s rulings are the law of the land, except if those rulings are not what conservatives want.<br><br> Alabama&#39;s maps will likely be challenged in court. But one reason the state&#39;s Republican leadership may feel comfortable with ignoring the justices in the first place is that Brett Kavanaugh and John Roberts were so clearly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/voting-rights-section-2-milligan/">holding their noses</a> in overturning a clear act of racial discrimination in voting that they might not be inclined to do it a second time.

That was naive at best then; Alabama is intent on illustrating why now.<br><br> Maybe Alabama is bluffing. Or maybe it simply doesn&#39;t believe that someone like Roberts, who has been dreaming of gutting the Voting Rights Act <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2013/02/john-roberts-long-war-against-voting-rights-act/">since he was in his 20s</a> , really means it. Or perhaps Alabama is reminding the Republican-appointed justices that the Court&#39;s legitimacy depends on its obedience to the conservative movement, whose view is that the only legitimate outcomes—or laws, or governments, or presidents, or Supreme Court rulings—are conservative ones.<br><br> It is that position, and the Court&#39;s reliable adherence to it, that has precipitated its loss of legitimacy.

Most were married, and most to other Jews. Their largest religious denomination was the Conservative movement, with its bland, spacious suburban synagogues, representing the middle ground between fusty tradition and full-forced reform. This was a community that seemed to have settled into a comfortable status quo, steadily assimilating in the postwar years and ascending into the middle class.<br><br> Still, there were signs that when it came to actual religious practice, a younger generation, coming of age during the 1960s, found this stability stultifying. The desire for change could be felt bubbling from below. In 1972, the first female rabbi was ordained. Two-thirds of Jews under 30 belonged to no synagogue at all. But in cities such as Boston, New York, and Washington, DC, groups of young, well-educated Jews had begun informally worshiping and studying together, eschewing institutional supervision and their parents&#39; conformity.<br><br> At one such communal gathering, known as Havurat Shalom, just outside Boston, three 20-somethings decided to produce a religious book that would be unlike anything anyone had ever seen: a lively, crowd-sourced compendium of how to live a Jewish life. It reimagined ancient ritual through a counterculture sensibility, challenging both the traditionalists on the right, whose ideology framed Judaism as a strict, all-inclusive package of rules and expectations, and the reformists on the left, who largely rejected ritual for a less demanding, less distinctive religious identity.<br><br> Published in 1973 by the Jewish Publication Society, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-first-jewish-catalog-richard-siegel/9780827600423?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Jewish Catalog</i></a> became a surprise best seller and has been in print ever since—this year, it celebrates its 50th anniversary. Only JPS&#39;s translation of the Bible has sold more copies for the publisher. <i>The Catalog</i> ’s bright-red cover, distinctive design, and whimsical illustrations empowered generations of Jews to experiment with new forms of practice and community, becoming the ultimate manual for those alienated and estranged from the tradition and seeking a more meaningful alternative. Today, when organized religion is beset by tumult and disengagement, <i>The Catalog</i> serves as a case study in how a grassroots effort to modernize religious life can succeed in profound and lasting ways, even as a question remains all these years later about how sustainable its changes actually were.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he 320-page book,</span> and its two sequels, emerged as the social unrest and political violence of the 1960s were giving way to a do-it-yourself counterculture epitomized in the publishing industry by the <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i> , which offered product reviews and practical resources extolling self-sufficiency. But although <i>The Jewish Catalog</i> started as a Jewish version of the <i>Whole Earth Catalog</i> , by the time its editors, Richard Siegel, Michael Strassfeld, and Sharon Strassfeld, signed with JPS, they had created something even more revolutionary.<br><br> Until they began their project, the classic text describing how to live a Jewish life was written in the 16th century by Joseph Caro: the <i>Shulchan Aruch</i> , which literally means “the set table,” an established, widely accepted code of Jewish law. By contrast, <i>The Jewish Catalog</i> offered an à la carte menu, encouraging readers to create for themselves a Judaism that was flexible, informal, and proactive. Want to observe the Sabbath but the prayers and laws don&#39;t resonate? All you want to do is bake challah once a week? Well, here&#39;s a recipe or two, along with hand-drawn depictions of several ways to braid the ceremonial bread.<br><br> “You can plug in wherever you want,” the editors wrote in the introduction.<br><br> Chaim Potok, by then an acclaimed novelist famous for <i>The Chosen</i> , was JPS&#39;s top editor, and although he immediately grasped <i>The Catalog</i> ’s potential, he faced a tough sell with some members of his board, who were aghast at publishing such an untraditional, at times irreverent work. But he persisted. “Chaim was a visionary,” Sharon Strassfeld told me.<br><br> At the time, the Strassfelds (who were then married) and Siegel (who died in 2018) were members of Havurat Shalom, a lay-led community that was among the pioneers of an egalitarian, participatory form of worship, learning, and ritual practice. <i>The Catalog</i> reflected those values. “We were writing about the lives we were living,” Sharon Strassfeld said.<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/orthodox-judaism-millennials/476118/">Read: Why Orthodox Judaism is appealing to so many millennials</a><br><br> The editors of <i>The Catalog</i> explicitly critiqued conventional Judaism as &quot;prefabricated, spoon-fed, nearsighted.&quot; They even titled one chapter “Using the Jewish Establishment—A Reluctant Guide.”<br><br> But overall, the tone and presentation were playful, inclusive, affirming. Fuzzy photographs of barefoot men and women clasping hands and circle-dancing were juxtaposed with an ultra-Orthodox bride and groom at their wedding; long-haired hippies were on one page, long-bearded Hasids on another. In Adrianne Onderdonk Dudden&#39;s design, the pages had a Talmudic feel, with commentary and explanations wrapped around the main text. Stu Copans&#39;s captivating line drawings were both instructive and cheeky; so were the editorial notes. (The recipe for <i>cholent</i> , a long-simmering stew, says it will feed 10 normal people or two Hungarians.)<br><br> “I don&#39;t think we were trying to stick it to the man,” Michael Strassfeld told me. “We had a very different way of seeing Jewish life, and this book was an expression of that. Organizational Jewish life was boring. Suburban Jewish life was boring. We were trying to connect to a more authentic past—trying to recapture something, not destroy the system. We wanted to provide another model.”<br><br> And that model exuded the carefree happiness and unconventionality of the broader youth culture. Why do prayer shawls have to come only in black and white? Why can&#39;t they be multicolored? And why can&#39;t women wear them too?<br><br> “It&#39;s the notion that you can do this, you can own it,” Beth Wenger, a history professor at the University of Pennsylvania, told me. “You don&#39;t need to go to some institution to do it. It&#39;s yours. That was what was so impactful.”<br><br> W <span class="smallcaps">ithout any mass marketing</span> to speak of, aided mostly by word of mouth and a <i>New York Times</i> story, <i>The Catalog</i> immediately sold out its first printing, moving 50,000 copies in its first three months, and 130,000 copies in 18 months. (More recent numbers are not available, though JPS says that total sales are in the many hundreds of thousands.)<br><br> For a niche publisher like JPS, those numbers were unprecedented. But this popularity did not come without controversy.<br><br> Most notable was a lengthy, scathing essay by Marshall Sklare, then the nation&#39;s preeminent sociologist of Jewish communal life, in the December 1974 issue of <i>Commentary</i> magazine. Titled “The Greening of Judaism”—this was not meant as a compliment—the essay criticized the <i>Catalog</i> editors for exempting “themselves from the central feature of Jewish religious law—its normativeness.”<br><br> <i>The Catalog</i> , Sklare summarized, “is rich in ironies, a work in which a genuine familiarity with Jewish sources and Jewish practice has been put at the service of the latest cultural and aesthetic predilections, with results that are funny, vulgar, charming, and meretricious all at once.”<br><br> Putting aside the lacerating, demeaning tone, Sklare pointed to a central truth: <i>The Catalog</i> was indeed advancing a Judaism that was focused on beauty and meaning and personal experience rather than on communal obligation and bowing to hierarchy and authority. You were invited to act and think a certain way, not commanded to do so.<br><br> But if <i>The Catalog</i> challenged the prevailing orthodoxy of the right, it was also an implicit rebuke to the American Judaism of the left, particularly the highly popular Reform movement, which at the time eschewed religious ritual and overt displays of ethnicity in favor of a more Protestantlike ethic, with many prayers in English and services that were briefer and left little room for displays of prayerful emotion.<br><br> So much of what <i>The Catalog</i> gave voice to 50 years ago has migrated from the margin to the mainstream of American Judaism&#39;s liberal denominations, and even some of its more conservative sectors. Today, synagogue worship in general is less formal and more participatory; ritual behavior is continually being reinvented. Egalitarianism has seeped into Modern Orthodoxy. And, propelled by the pandemic, every other Jewish household, it seems, is making challah for Shabbat.<br><br> More broadly, Beth Wenger noted, <i>The Catalog</i> ’s outlook “is characteristic of American religion, which is largely a menu today.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/08/zohar-kabbalah-mainstream-judaism/537621/">Read: Restoring Kabbalah to mainstream Judaism</a><br><br> Perhaps not even Marshall Sklare, were he still alive, would dispute that <i>The Jewish Catalog</i> had a penetrating and lasting impact on American Judaism. But the big book that seemed to be on everyone&#39;s shelf is now largely a beloved historical artifact. The internet provides in a millisecond what <i>The Catalog</i> ’s authors took years to compile. Books meant to be resources are instantly outdated the moment they go to press. Pages and pages of <i>The Catalog</i> ’s finely packed chapters listing scholars and references and organizations are now obsolete.<br><br> Traditional gatekeepers of knowledge and guidance—be they rabbis or other experts—have barely a supporting role in many of life&#39;s dramas. That is largely due to technological advances, but it&#39;s also because of the diminished importance of religious institutions in the daily lives of American Jews and, indeed, many other Americans.<br><br> Whether <i>The Catalog</i> initiated that development or catalyzed it, whether it shifted the direction of American Judaism or gave vivid expression to a shift already in the making, it is hard to imagine contemporary American Jewish life without the permission to experiment that this quirky, oversize book represented.<br><br> “The most subversive thing we did, and it was completely inadvertent, is that we were giving people in English tools so that they could build their own Jewish lives,” Sharon Strassfeld said. “Until then, who was writing a Jewish book? Rabbis and scholars. <i>The Catalog</i> ’s entire purpose is to give ownership to people of their own Judaism.”<br><br> As a book, <i>The Catalog</i> ’s origin story had all the ingredients for success: idealistic and knowledgeable editors, a visionary publisher, a moment ripe for disruption. But in order to truly inspire a movement to reinvent religious life, the book also required readers with the skills, passion, and commitment to embrace its DIY ethos. It takes a lot of work to truly own one&#39;s religion, to be responsible for its sustainability. Half a century on, <i>The Catalog</i> ’s contributions endure, but so do the lingering challenges of making faith feel relevant and fresh in a modern world.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 28 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/the-jewish-catalog-50th-anniversary/674846/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/the-jewish-catalog-50th-anniversary/674846/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[After 30 Years in Israel, I See My Country Differently]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Inside the Israeli crack-up <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/BmhCzSvXcdVITJeiy3c4J7VQvBg=/0x0:5076x2855/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/AP23205574760473/original.jpg" alt="照片显示以色列示威者。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Ohad Zwigenberg / AP</figcaption></figure> Israel in the past six months has felt like a madhouse, a political protest the size of New Jersey, an unending traffic jam, a lab for bad ideas, a glimpse of the future of Western democracy in the social-media age. It has also been a classroom, even for those of us who think we&#39;re experts. I&#39;ve lived and written here for nearly 30 years. But as I stood among thousands of other protesters outside the Knesset on Monday, the midday heat so strong that I almost longed for relief from the police water cannon, I realized that I was learning to see the country with new eyes.<br><br> Inside the Knesset, the most extreme government in Israel&#39;s history was legislating the first stage of its plan to move power from the courts and into its own hands, changing the rules of the democratic game. The law passed. The protest couldn&#39;t stop it. One opposition lawmaker <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Ram_Ben_Barak/status/1683437467515461635">described</a> it as the hardest day of his life, and he used to be the No. 2 man in the Mossad. Like many people here, I&#39;ve been at a demonstration almost every week since the beginning of the year. This one had the same chanting and flag-waving, but it seemed desperate, with an undercurrent less of defiance than of fear. A chapter in Israeli history was ending. We don&#39;t know what comes next.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-supreme-court-netanyahu-parliament/674833/">Yair Rosenberg: Israel has already lost</a><br><br> The Israeli breakdown of 2023 has thrown into sharp relief the country&#39;s submerged assumptions and blind spots, as well as my own.<br><br> The state of Israel was declared in a rush on May 14, 1948, amid an attack by the combined forces of the Arab world. The declaration of independence in Tel Aviv that day promised a constitution “no later than the 1st of October,” but we never got around to it. Instead, we&#39;ve relied on stop-gap measures, political deals that seemed logical at the time, and an unwritten idea of the way things are done. Israel was held together less by law than by custom. Like many Israelis, I sensed this without grasping the risk. These customs were almost invisible when they were in effect. They&#39;re possible to see clearly now because they&#39;re gone.<br><br> It was customary, for example, for a prime minister to resign if facing prosecution. It was customary not to put criminals in charge of law enforcement. It was customary to respect civil servants, to listen to the soldiers and spies who keep Israelis safe in a dangerous region, and never to politicize the judiciary.<br><br> The last norm, discarded along with the rest by the current government, is at the heart of our troubles. In the Israeli system, a simple majority had no official limit on its power. So the Supreme Court evolved into a check on the state, protecting civil rights and fighting corruption with legal tools that themselves had an ad hoc air. But early this year, having secured less than 49 percent of the popular vote, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu&#39;s new government announced a “legal reform” that would neuter the court and thus remove the only institutional check on government power. Netanyahu hadn&#39;t presented this plan before the election. The press conference had the tone of a declaration of war. Without judicial review, the government can delay elections, outlaw opposition parties, expand the power of clerics, and appoint officials convicted of corruption. (All of these ideas have been suggested by members of his coalition.)<br><br> The truth was always that a majority in the Knesset could free itself from all restraints merely by voting to do so. The only barrier, it turns out, was the customary deference to norms. These existed only as long as we all believed in them, and the void left by their absence is now filled by suspicion and protest.<br><br> Last weekend, tens of thousands of people marched with Israeli flags up the highway from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. As I write, a park near the Knesset is full of tents housing protesters. When I was at the encampment, volunteer teams were making food and distributing water bottles. Groups with flags were walking uphill to the protest zone outside the Knesset while others descended, red-faced and hoarse, to rest in the shade. Those looking for inspiration in this dark year have found it in this extraordinary mobilization, manifested not on Facebook but on the street, every single week since January. No one, least of all the government, saw it coming. This raises the question of where everyone has been until now. After all, Netanyahu and the right have been in power, with only a brief break, since 2009.<br><br> The short answer is, in tech and on vacation. After Palestinian suicide bombings and rockets destroyed Israel&#39;s political left in the late &#39;90s and early aughts, and amid an economic boom, liberal Israelis of the middle class pursued prosperity, often found it, and fell into a political slumber. Meanwhile the settler movement and its sympathizers were hard at work gaining power in state institutions and gluing together an alliance with Likud and the ultra-Orthodox parties, using the language of Jewish tradition and of hostility toward the liberal state dreamed up by Israel&#39;s founders.<br><br> Liberal Israelis held to their old assumption about the settlements, which is that they&#39;re temporary and external to the state of Israel, and the settlers are fringe eccentrics. They assumed that Netanyahu&#39;s basic aim was to achieve peace and prosperity for citizens – the same goal as theirs, that is, even if he pursued it in ways they didn&#39;t like.<br><br> These assumptions have been shattered by the people now in power. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the minister in charge of the police, and Bezalel Smotrich, the finance minister, who also controls part of the defense ministry, come from the messianic settler movement, which has an entirely different goal: Jewish domination of the entire land of Israel and a state governed by some form of religious law. This is the ideology that drove the assassin of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and the mass murderer of Muslim worshipers in Hebron in 1994, Baruch Goldstein, whose photo Ben-Gvir kept on his living-room wall until recently.<br><br> For this extreme element, war is not a horror to be avoided at all costs but a trial that would be justified to further God&#39;s plan, or an event that might even be desirable when the time is ripe. As cabinet ministers, they&#39;ve been given the potential power to help start a war, whether with an expulsion of Palestinian residents in Jerusalem, for example, or a provocation at the Muslim holy sites on the Temple Mount. For level-headed Israelis in uniform, and for parents whose teenagers face the draft, this is the stuff of nightmares.<br><br> The protests erupted when Israelis were forced to realize that not only are the settlers not going anywhere in the West Bank; they&#39;ve assumed central functions of government in Israel proper and are moving fast to knock out the only remaining brake on their power. With the Supreme Court out of the way, a transformation of the state will be possible. These are the stakes, and they help explain the surge of anger and dread we&#39;ve seen, and particularly the extraordinary announcement from thousands of military reservists, including pilots and command personnel, that they&#39;ll refuse to report for duty. This is less a calculated pressure tactic than a howl of distress. Had I not aged out of the infantry reserves six years ago, I&#39;d consider doing the same.<br><br> Another unpleasant reality on display in the recent upheaval is the fault line that runs between Israeli Jews with roots in Europe (known as Ashkenazim) and those with roots in the Islamic world (Mizrahim, in our local shorthand). We expend great effort to pretend that our debates are only about policy, not identity, but that isn&#39;t true. The grievance felt by many families whose roots are in places like Casablanca and Algiers, and who were sidelined by the country&#39;s Eastern European founders and the official narratives, has not faded—on the contrary, it seems to have grown.<br><br> Anyone at the demonstrations understands that the protesters are mostly middle-class Ashkenazim. The cops guarding and occasionally manhandling us are mainly working-class Mizrahim, as are the traditional Likud rank and file. Most people in fighter squadrons, commando companies, and intelligence outfits are Ashkenazi and liberal. The academy and the tech boardrooms are much the same. This sociological fact says nothing good about our society. At least half of the Jewish population here is Mizrahi, but we&#39;ve never had a Mizrahi prime minister, and the Supreme Court has a woeful lack of ethnic diversity.<br><br> Good leadership could address the divide. But for politicians like Netanyahu, divisions aren&#39;t problems—they&#39;re weapons. He hoped to use the fury of this electorate as political jet fuel, gambling that it would propel him upward and not blow us all to pieces. Likud&#39;s grievance coalition with settlers and the ultra-Orthodox now openly derides the Supreme Court as a hostile Ashkenazi elite, the civil service as a “deep state,” air-force pilots as privileged brats, and army officers as traitors.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-limit-supreme-court-power-protests/674819/">Natan Sachs: Israel on the brink</a><br><br> Netanyahu&#39;s reputation, even among opponents, was that of a political grand master. This reputation joins many other assumptions on the trash heap of 2023. Netanyahu is a shell who&#39;s lost everything but his old baritone. The forces he released have escaped his control and now others are in charge, people who see politics not as a mechanism for solving problems but as an arena for spoils, confrontation, and revenge.<br><br> Never in all my years here have I heard so much talk of emigration. Israelis once thought our internal problems and external conflicts could be resolved, so sticking it out made sense. Today the opposite is true; we do not seem on our way to a happy resolution.<br><br> When I moved to Israel in 1995, finding Nikes or Levis was difficult and travel was a luxury. In 2023, the protesters are in the same Zara tank tops and Garmins you see in Berlin or Palo Alto. Middle-class Israelis speak English. They watch <i>Succession</i> . They have other options.

I pass by often on my daily errands, and it always seems orderly and permanent. But on Monday the same road was closed, a turbulence of police trucks and blue-and-white flags. Inside the building, the forces of disintegration were at work.  Everything seemed to be moving fast, faster than we could grasp. The edifices of state felt as tenuous as holograms, as if I could pass my hand through them. The pink flowers planted in rows on the median disappeared under the sneakers of protesters, and then under the hoofs of the horses pushing us back. I looked down again. The irrigation pipes had been ripped out and the flower bed was mud.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 28 Jul 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-judicial-reform-and-protests-netanyahu/674849/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-judicial-reform-and-protests-netanyahu/674849/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Song That First Captured Sinéad O’Connor’s Power]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Before “Nothing Compares 2 U” made her a household name, a single from the Irish singer&#39;s first album established her as a creative force. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/lmLTodOiq2ye6mR1qmm64rNRRFk=/0x402:3735x2503/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_168935759/original.jpg" alt="The singer Sinéad O’Connor, performing in concert" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Frans Schellekens / Redferns / Getty</figcaption></figure> There&#39;s a candid moment in <em>Nothing Compares</em> , the 2022 documentary by Kathryn Ferguson about the life and career of Sinéad O&#39;Connor, when the singer says, “It was such a shock for me to become a pop star. It&#39;s not what I wanted. I just wanted to scream.” O&#39;Connor, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/26/arts/music/sinead-oconnor-dead.html">who died yesterday</a> at the age of 56, became famous in the late &#39;80s, when she was barely out of her teens. In 1990, her cover of Prince&#39;s “Nothing Compares 2 U” became not only her signature song, but also a chart-topper in numerous countries—a sweep that thrust a shy Irish kid under the hot sun of international scrutiny.<br><br> Rather than moderate her voice, she kept screaming. And over the years, her many controversial protests and statements tended to overshadow her breathtaking body of work. When people vow to murder you (as they did after she ripped up a photo of Pope John Paul II on <em>Saturday Night Live</em> ) and Frank Sinatra publicly threatens to assault you (as he did when she refused to have the American national anthem played at a New Jersey concert in 1990), it&#39;s hard to direct attention back to the thing that actually made you famous: your music.<br><br> The fact that she became a pop star—and not just any pop star, but one of the most distinct, most outspoken, and most influential of all time—may have been a surprise to her. But it couldn&#39;t have been a surprise to her fans. Few things made that clearer than her first hit, “Mandinka.” The song, which became a Top 20 hit in the United Kingdom, was the standout single and obvious earworm from her superb 1987 debut LP, <em>The Lion and the Cobra</em> . It was an ambitious album, collecting dark accounts of childhood trauma (“Troy”) and layered explorations of lust and consent (“I Want Your (Hands on Me)”). Amid these deeper, more demanding singles, <em>The Lion and the Cobra</em> needed an upbeat invitation. “Mandinka” was it. <br><br><div class="oembed" data-oembed-name="www.youtube.com" data-oembed-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h08pCvyKfbs"><figure class="c-embedded-video"><div class="embed-wrapper" style="display: block; position:relative; width:100%; height:0; overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:75.00%;"><iframe allow="autoplay; fullscreen; encrypted-media; picture-in-picture;" allowfullscreen="true" class="embedly-embed lazyload" data-src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2Fh08pCvyKfbs%3Ffeature%3Doembed&amp;display_name=YouTube&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dh08pCvyKfbs&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2Fh08pCvyKfbs%2Fhqdefault.jpg&amp;key=8164a61223cb4585ad276041728caca9&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=youtube" frameborder="0" height="480" scrolling="no" style="position:absolute; width:100%; height:100%; top:0; left:0; border:0;" title="YouTube 嵌入" width="640" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe></div></figure></div> Written when O&#39;Connor was still a teenager struggling to make her way as an aspiring expat in London, “Mandinka” is a propulsive anthem that straddles pop and the loosely knit genre of alternative rock, which wouldn&#39;t see its full commercial triumph until the &#39;90s. The lyrics don&#39;t convey a narrative as such, but like so many of O&#39;Connor&#39;s songs, “Mandinka” synthesizes and projects a string of images, recriminations, and mantras. What coalesces in her words is a barrage of beefs with the patriarchy that refuses to sacrifice poetry for purpose. The title comes from Alex Haley&#39;s <em>Roots</em> , which mentions the Gambian ethnic group of Mandinka. “Mandinka” was slightly ahead of its time, but it&#39;s also very much in the same camp as contemporaneous songs such as Neneh Cherry&#39;s “Buffalo Stance” and Enya&#39;s “Orinoco Flow.” (Unsurprisingly, her fellow Irish artist Enya made a guest appearance on <em>The Lion and the Cobra</em> .)<br><br> “Mandinka,” at its core, is a song of defiance. O&#39;Connor threw every bit of texture and range—snarling, chanting, cooing, and, yes, screaming—she could into the song, and the result was a smack in the face of conventionality. Hurt is part of the DNA of “Mandinka,” even as O&#39;Connor exults in her power to withstand it: “I don&#39;t know no shame / I feel no pain / I can&#39;t see the flame,” she sings with venom. Again, defiance. But it&#39;s not a denial or some bluff—instead, it&#39;s an acknowledgement of how she&#39;s proudly used her scar tissue as raw material.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2015/04/how-nothing-compares-2-u-endured/391122/">Read: How “Nothing Compares 2 U” endured</a><br><br> “Soon I can give you my heart,” O&#39;Connor chants at the end of “Mandinka.” That&#39;s exactly what she did: The lushly romantic “Nothing Compares 2 U” came out three years later, becoming the song that most people immediately think of when they hear O&#39;Connor&#39;s name. But the power of “Nothing Compares 2 U” partly stemmed from the fact that O&#39;Connor had already proved herself capable of far greater force on <em>The Lion and the Cobra</em> , and in “Mandinka” in particular. Her first appearance on US television was on <em>Late Night With David Letterman</em> , and her performance of the single is telling. She wears a spiked denim jacket like punk-rock armor, holding her arms in front of her and twisting back and forth like she&#39;s dodging blows in a boxing ring.<br><br> Perhaps the most succinct tribute to the impact of “Mandinka” is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rB3qDlu5Nvg">a video of Fiona Apple</a> , posted to YouTube in 2017. In it, Apple lies in bed with her laptop while singing and air-punching along to O&#39;Connor&#39;s 1989 Grammy performance. It was a historic one: Nominated that year for Best Female Rock Vocal, O&#39;Connor infamously drew Public Enemy&#39;s bull&#39;s-eye logo on her head to protest the fact that the newly minted Grammy for Best Rap Performance was awarded off camera. (On Twitter yesterday, the group&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/MrChuckD/status/1684278409868763160">Chuck D</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/FlavorFlav/status/1684305143574003715">Flavor Flav</a> both remembered the protest.)<br><br> When the chorus hits, Apple ups the volume and kisses the screen. It&#39;s a gesture of joyous release and empowerment that mirrors the song itself. “I didn&#39;t mean to be strong,” O&#39;Connor says at the start of Ferguson&#39;s documentary. “I wasn&#39;t thinking to myself, <em>I must be strong</em> . I didn&#39;t know I was strong.” All it takes is one listen to “Mandinka,” though, for anyone else to know, feel, and find themselves strengthened by her strength.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 27 Jul 2023 18:02:19 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/sinead-oconnor-legacy-mandinka-song/674844/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/sinead-oconnor-legacy-mandinka-song/674844/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Are You Plagued by the Feeling That Everyone Used to Be Nicer?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>不要屈服。这是一种心理错觉。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/GW_aY81Q6JVAd2ooOzHsyY0N5EM=/0x0:4796x2698/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/radio_atlantic_2/original.jpg" alt="照片中，两名年轻女子和一名年轻男子一起提着垃圾桶走在附近的人行道上。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>伦·特里夫诺/赫尔顿档案馆/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>我和我的兄弟争论了很久。他坚称，他现在在纽约长大的孩子们比我们小时候在同一个街区长大的孩子们安全得多。我碰巧知道这是荒谬的，多年来我一直试图说服他。我给他看了新闻报道、犯罪统计数据。有一次我什至下载了一份联邦调查局的报告，毫无疑问地显示 30 年前的纽约要危险得多。但他不为所动。他记得我们的童年更加温和、安全。我必须承认，有时候，当我在老邻居周围散步时，我会看到邮递员向 10 岁的我脱帽致意，而当我回家吃晚饭时，邻居们微笑着。<br><br>为什么我们很多人都有这样的感觉：年轻时，人们更友善、更有道德，并且更好地互相照顾？一位名叫亚当·马斯楚安尼 (Adam Mastroianni) 的实验心理学家也对这种持久的信念感到好奇，并最近在 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06137-x"><em>《自然》杂志</em></a>上发表了对这一现象的系统研究。<br><br>马斯楚安尼记录道，这种模糊的记忆是许多不同人群所共有的，并且感受相当强烈。他解释了这种幻觉是如何运作的，以及为什么它对我们有如此大的影响力。最重要的是，他解释了它如何不仅扭曲我们的个人关系，而且扭曲我们的文化和政治。在<em>大西洋广播电台</em>的这一集中，我与马斯楚安尼和特约撰稿人朱莉·贝克谈论了道德衰退的幻觉，以及为什么它如此强烈地持续存在。<br><br><em>每当</em><em>政治家或有抱负的政治家声称，“事情曾经更好，让我负责，我会让它们再次变得更好”时，这是我们听过很多次的非常古老的事情。它引起了我们的共鸣，也许是因为我们准备相信它，即使它不是真的。</em><br><br>请听这里的对话： <br><br><iframe class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.megaphone.fm/ATL9319336197" frameborder="no" height="200" scrolling="no" title="嵌入互动内容" width="100%" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe><em>在此订阅：</em> <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/radio-atlantic/id1258635512"><em>Apple 播客</em></a><em>|</em> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4PgNKjRJJWlaV6zuNr69BO"><em>Spotify</em></a> <em>|</em><a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/radio-atlantic"><em>缝合器</em></a><em>|</em> <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vcmFkaW9hdGxhbnRpYw"><em>谷歌播客</em></a><em>|</em> <a href="https://pca.st/ccxU"><em>Pocket Casts</em></a><strong><em>为了清晰起见，以下剧集记录已被轻微编辑：</em></strong><br><br><strong>汉娜·罗辛：</strong>所以，朱莉，你知道的——尽管当其他人说人们过去比较友善时我会很生气，但我想我也可能有这种感觉。<br><br>如果我有童年的幻象，当我从操场走在街上时，我想象所有的邻居都会说：“嗨，小汉娜。” [<em>笑声</em>] 邮差过来了，你知道，他向我脱帽致意，还有老人在遛狗。<br><br>而且，你知道，我不知道这个记忆是否准确，但我确实有这样的感觉：人们更加友善。<br><br><strong>朱莉·贝克：</strong>你是在<em>罗杰斯先生的街区</em>长大的吗？或者那是什么？<br><br><strong>松香：</strong>没有；我实际上是在纽约皇后区长大的。所以这可能是、当然不是真的。 [<em>笑声。</em> ]<br><br>这是<em>大西洋广播电台</em>。我是汉娜·罗辛。我邀请我的同事朱莉·贝克来谈论一些一直困扰我的事情。当人们谈论今天的情况比过去糟糕得多时。<br><br>他们会说“邻居以前比较友善，每个人都对你微笑并帮助你。”有时只是爷爷的闲聊，你几乎可以忽略它。有时又会变成“男人是男人，女人是女人”之类的事情，这更烦人。<br><br><strong><em>贝克：</em></strong><em>有一个善意的愿望，比如向邮递员致敬。然后是“哦，我们需要恢复 20 世纪 50 年代的社会秩序。”然后你会想，“哇，我们怎么到了这里？”</em><br><br>朱莉分析心理学研究和社会趋势，她还是另一个大西洋播客<em>“如何与人交谈”</em>的主持人。<br><br>她来这里是为了帮助我理解这项刚刚出现的非常有趣的研究，该研究表明人们坚信一切都变得更糟了。<br><br><strong><em>亚当·马斯楚安尼</em></strong><strong>：</strong><em>我一生都听到人们这样说，“你过去可以在晚上不锁门”，或者“你不能再相信别人的话了。”</em><br><br><em>我总是对这类言论感到恼火。所以部分原因是想证明每个人都错了。但其中也有一部分是这样的，</em>好吧，如果他们是对的，这就是一个大问题。<em>这就是我们开始的地方。</em><br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>那是亚当·马斯楚安尼。他最近在<em>《自然》杂志</em>上发表了一篇名为《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.experimental-history.com/p/the-illusion-of-moral-decline">道德衰退的幻觉</a>》的论文。亚当是一位心理学家，也是科学博客<em>“实验历史”的作者。</em>他花了十年时间系统地研究为什么我们感觉过去的情况更好……以及这意味着什么。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>我认为我读研究生的第一年是特朗普当选的时候。很明显，这是“让美国再次伟大”成为当今时代氛围的时刻。<br><br>看到“过去是好的，现在是坏的，让我负责，我可以带回美好的过去”的说法也让我明白，这比叔叔、姐夫和互联网上的人说的这些话要重要得多——这些说法引起了人们的共鸣，有助于让人们进入椭圆形办公室。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。我的意思是，我不得不说，这就是我对你的研究感兴趣的动机，因为我一直对为什么这句话引起如此强烈的共鸣有一种超然的好奇心。<br><br>比如，为什么——不仅是美国领导人，全世界的领导人——他们只要说：“哦，那时的情况好多了”，人们就会立刻明白这一点？就像，他们甚至不需要解释。你可以说：“你知道，让美国再次伟大。”这就像四个字，所有的假设都立刻就出现在人们面前。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。当我在学术背景下就这篇论文发表演讲时，我首先是特朗普就职演说的结尾，他在演讲中说：“你知道，我们将使美国再次富裕、再次自豪、再次安全、再次伟大。”我指出，这些句子中最重要的词不是<em>“美国”</em> 、 <em>“安全</em>”、 <em>“自豪”</em> 、 <em>“强大”</em>或<em>“伟大”</em> 。<em>又来了</em>。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是啊！<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>光是这个词就可以起到很大的作用。 Which is that: Well, if things used to be great but aren&#39;t now, it means something changed.这意味着我们可以将其改回来。它唤起了一种失落感，但也唤起了一种恢复损失的可能性的感觉。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。 And it is the word <em>again</em> . It&#39;s like that one little word sort of resolves something emotionally for people.很难确切地理解它是如何工作的，但你<em>再说一遍</em>这个词，每个人都会说，“啊，你刚刚为我填补了一个洞。”你知道？当你说“道德沦丧”时，你到底是什么意思？如果这是一种幻觉，为什么感觉如此真实？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>关于人们在谈论道德衰退时可能会想到什么，有一些完全合理的假设。也许每个人的意思都是，“我听说 20 世纪 50 年代是一段非常美好的时光。所以我真正要告诉你的是，从那时起，情况已经有所下降。”并不是说过去10年情况变得更糟；而是说他们的情况在过去10年里变得更糟。你知道，20 年前或 50 年前，情况变得更糟。我们现在正生活在困难时期。<br><br>在后来的一项研究中，我们要求人们回溯得更早。 “那20年前呢？那40年前呢？”他们告诉我们的是——“在我到达之前，什么也没有发生。一切都很好。然后我出生了，然后一切就开始走下坡路了。”<br><br>特别有趣的是：你出生的时间并不重要。所以30岁的人告诉我们这发生在30年前。 60岁的人告诉我们这发生在60年前。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>等等，真的吗？那么从字面上看，人们认为衰落是在他们来到这个地球时就开始的吗？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。所以，我的意思是，我们不会问前一天或后一天。但我们提出的问题是：“评价一下当今人们的善良、诚实、友善和优秀程度。那你20岁的那一年呢？”人们告诉我们那时更好。<br><br> “那你的出生年份呢？”人们告诉我们，那时的情况甚至更好。然后我们问：“那 20 年前呢？那40年前呢？”<br><br>人们的答案没有什么不同。那条线是平的。直到我们问到“你出生20年后”时，电话才停下来。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>这太有趣了。我认为我没有完全理解这一点。因此，人们将生活中的任何个人困难或挣扎（现在也许是我的推断）投射到整个人类身上，就像他们将自己的寿命保护到历史的、更广泛的文化、政治寿命上。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。我的意思是，这是人们记忆的偏差，因为你没有出生之前的记忆。你确实拥有出生后大部分时间的记忆。<br><br>因此，如果这是一种记忆偏差，那么它在你出生的那一刻附近的某个时间就会开启，这是有道理的。显然不完全是这样，但这可以解释为什么我们看不到人们在出生之前和之后的想法。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>你年轻真的不重要吗？你知道，刻板印象显然是辛普森爷爷。就好像，老年人总是在谈论过去的事情如何更好，但年轻人却不一定。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的；我们完全期望也能找到这一点，但我们并没有真正找到。因此，当你问人们一生中所感受到的衰退时，年轻人和老年人所感受到的衰退并没有什么不同。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>朱莉，我很惊讶地发现老年人和年轻人对这种道德下降的看法没有区别。我的意思是，你不是一个老人；你是一个老人。你年轻。那么你还记得曾经有过这种感觉吗？<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>我清楚地记得我直到 2013 年搬到华盛顿才拥有智能手机。所以在那之前的几年里，当我住在芝加哥时，我记得在街上与陌生人进行了很多互动。<br><br>我绝对不会再像以前那样频繁地拥有这些了。我认为这只是因为我们都在看手机，对吗？所以我的一部分有点浪漫化了，你知道的，前智能手机时代的偶遇以及所有这些。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。当我听到你这么说时，我想，<em>哦，朱莉有这种感觉很好，我有这种感觉也很好。</em>但如果我把它乘以几百万倍，那么我就会得到“让我们回到事情更好的时代”的政治运动，而我真的不太喜欢。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>是的。这也让我想到的一件事是，一系列研究发现，美国的社会信任实际上几十年来一直在下降。因此，人们基本上越来越不可能说大多数其他人通常是可以信任的。<br><br>所以你完全正确，认为过去更好、人们过去更值得信赖确实有很大的政治影响。<br><br>对我来说，这感觉就像是一个先有鸡还是先有蛋的问题。比如，我们是否因为相信人们的道德品质变得更差而减少对他们的信任？或者我们是否认为人们变得更糟是因为我们与社区更加脱节？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>我们在这里关注一个非常狭窄的问题，即“人们在日常生活中对待彼此的方式是否随着时间的推移而改变？”人们认为它有吗？<br><br>这是一个当事情糟糕时，他们很容易看起来事情变得更糟的模型。所以我不认为这是我们可能发现这种幻觉的唯一领域，因为人们对生活的很多不同部分都这么说。<br><br>你知道：艺术比以前更糟糕了。这种文化比以前更糟糕了。教育制度比以前更糟糕了。但对我来说，很明显我们倾向于相信这是真的，即使事实并非如此。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>您在这项研究中的假设是——人们认为某种道德已经下降。但在你心里，它并没有下降。所以对你来说，这就像一个幻觉。我的意思是，你称之为幻觉。 Right?<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>好的。那么根据这个假设，你的解释是什么？比如，为什么我们大多数人都会在妄想/幻觉下运作？就像<em>你</em>所说的事情显然不是真的。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>我们认为两种认知偏差可以结合起来产生这种错觉。所以这个解释有两个部分。第一个是我们所说的偏见曝光，即人们倾向于关注主要是负面的信息，尤其是关于他们不认识的人的信息。<br><br>因此，这既是他们收到的关于他们不认识的人的信息（主要是负面的），也是他们关注的信息的组合。所以这就是为什么当你看看你个人世界之外的世界时，它看起来充满了做坏事的人。他们撒谎、欺骗、偷窃和杀人。<br><br>解释的第二部分就是我们所说的偏见记忆。记忆研究人员注意到，坏记忆的坏处往往比好记忆的美好消失得更快。<br><br>因此，如果你的高中舞会被拒绝，当时的感觉会很糟糕。二十年后，这也许是一个有趣的故事。如果你有一个很棒的高中舞会，当时的感觉非常好。 20年后的今天，这仍然是一段美好的回忆。感觉虽然不如体验时那么美好，但感觉还是蛮不错的。<br><br>事实证明，平均而言，人们的记忆会发生这样的情况：坏的记忆比好的记忆更快地接近中性，而坏的记忆更有可能被遗忘，并且在回顾时变得更好。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>汉娜，当我读到这篇论文时，我想知道人们是否在某种程度上正在意识到世界正在发生真正的变化。<br><br>社会信任度下降，但也存在普遍的孤独感和脱节感，以及社区生活的侵蚀，即了解邻居的人越来越少，社区组织的成员人数不断减少。<br><br>所有这些事情肯定会对人们的个人生活产生影响。但我认为这表现为一种模糊的感觉，比如<em>，哦，交朋友更难了，或者感觉自己是社区的一部分更难了。</em><br><br>所以我想知道我们是否感受到了这种模糊和令人不安的脱节感，并给它一个错误的解释：事情过去比以前更好，而人们只是比以前更糟糕。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>哦，这真的很有趣。所以你说的感觉是真实的。就像，有些事情发生了变化的感觉是真实的，因为有些事情<em>已经发生了</em>变化。更多的是疏离感和孤独感。<br><br>所以我们编造了这个非常简洁的故事。就像，“当我还是个孩子的时候，事情变得更好了，人们也变得更好了，邮递员向他致敬”——我们就到此为止了。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>是的；确实有一些真实的事情正在发生，会让人们感到与周围的陌生人脱节。我想知道，是的，我们是否只是在心理上遇到困难，不知道为什么会这样。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong> Adam，我想介绍一下你的一些理论。一种可能是某些事情实际上已经发生了变化。我们只是用了错误的名字来称呼它。就好像，有些东西已经下降了。这是来自不同的关于社会信任的心理学研究。<br><br>我们的孤立感、联系感、面对面的接触都发生了变化。就像有些社会变化是真实的、结构性的，在我们身上留下了一个漏洞，我们错误地命名了<em>道德</em>。<br><br>当我们读到这里时，我们认为有些事情正在发生变化，这确实让我们有点绝望——也许我们只是叫错了它们的名字。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>就像我们有一种难以置信的强烈感觉，觉得有些事情出了问题，而“某事”是联系、社区或类似的东西。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。因此，很容易从“人们不像以前那样友善”变成<em>“事情</em>比以前更糟糕了”。因此，随着时间的推移，对机构的信任确实在下降。很多人还表示，人与人之间的信任随着时间的推移而下降。事实上，我认为这种情况比机构信任度的下降更为夸大。<br><br>理查德·艾巴赫 (Richard Eibach) 做了一些研究，探讨人们如何看待世界变得更加危险。他发现人们相信这一点。相信这一点的人尤其是父母。当你问那些父母“世界什么时候变得更加危险？”时，你会得到一个与他们第一个孩子的出生日期非常接近的日期。<br><br>明显的含义是世界没有任何变化。改变的是你的世界观。你知道，现在你必须保护这个脆弱的生命——因此你对世界上的危险更加敏感。这就是为什么你认为它们还有更多。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>你知道，朱莉，我一直和我哥哥进行这样的谈话，他总是告诉我他的孩子不安全。他住在纽约。他说：“我的孩子不安全。他们不能出去。他们不能走下街区。”就像，他真的吓坏了，你知道吗？而且：“这比我们小时候安全多了。”我说，“伙计，我们是 70 年代在纽约长大的，对吧？”确实不安全。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>就像统计上的那样。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>从统计上看。我给他看了新闻文章，我还拿出了一份联邦调查局的报告。我特意下载了一份联邦调查局的报告，其中显示了我们小时候纽约的犯罪统计数据。<br><br>他对此的信念是如此坚定。我无法让他动心。我无法向他展示足够的数字或统计数据让他思考，<em>哦，现在情况并没有更糟</em>。<br><br>我的意思是，亚当·马斯楚安尼实际上对此有一个术语。这对我的兄弟来说有点刻薄，但他的用语是<em>不劳而获的信念</em>。我认为他的意思正是如此。就像：你的信念非常强烈，即使你没有任何基础来支持你所附加的非常强烈的信念的故事。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>是的。我的意思是，不管联邦调查局的报告如何，你哥哥给自己讲的故事似乎在情感上引起了超级共鸣。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>我们告诉自己的关于自己生活的故事确实在某种程度上塑造了我们是谁。这真的很有趣，因为当我们向自己讲述这些关于我们个人生活的故事时，很多时候这些故事属于两类之一。一是救赎，二是污染。<br><br>因此，救赎的故事就像这样：“我经历了这些考验，并因此变得更加坚强，事情正在好转。”而污染故事则像这样：“这些考验征服了我，我现在已经崩溃了，从根本上来说，我是一个更糟糕的人。”<br><br>如果你听说污染序列对人们的心理健康不利，你可能不会感到惊讶。这项研究是根据我们讲述的个人生活故事完成的。但感觉就像我们在讲述一个关于全人类的污染故事。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>我想让我沮丧的是：为什么那些会粘在一起？我的意思是，美国社会有一些流行的救赎故事。<br><br>但我觉得，在历史上的很多时刻，现在就是其中之一，这些污染故事——比如“美国曾经伟大”或“俄罗斯曾经伟大”——有一种特殊的情感力量，可以真正团结人们。<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>是的。我的意思是，也许这有点像你哥哥在纽约的恐惧，对吧？就像——那是发自内心的情感。这是您孩子的安全。所以，当然，这将会产生更强烈的影响。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>亚当，你发现人口统计数据之间有任何明显的差异吗？那么，如果不是老年人和年轻人之间存在差异，那么性别差异或具有不同政治意识形态的人之间又如何呢？<br><br> <strong>Mastroianni：</strong>我们没有发现任何性别差异。我们没有发现种族群体之间存在任何差异。我们没有发现任何教育差异。我们发现的唯一的其他人口差异是意识形态和政治方面的差异。随着时间的推移，那些自认为更保守的人比那些自认为自由的人感觉衰退更多。<br><br>但即使对于那些最自由的人来说，他们仍然说今天的人们比 10 年前、20 年前或过去的任何时候都不那么友善。所以这是保守派说得更大声，但自由派也这么说的。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>因此，自认为自由主义者的人可能会相信种族主义和性别歧视有所减少，但仍然相信其他普遍的普遍道德标志已经下降。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。事实上，他们似乎确实如此。在我们的研究中，当我们问他们“为什么？你在想什么？”对他们来说确实出现的一件事是有更多的宽容。种族主义、性别歧视、体能歧视越来越少；所有的<em>主义</em>。<br><br>所以，当人们说人们不像以前那么友善时，他们自然想到的似乎并不是这个。因为如果你直接问他们，“例如，你认为人们对待非裔美国人比过去更加尊重和礼貌还是更少？”，大多数人今天会比过去说得更多。<br><br>但如果你问他们，“今天人们是更友善了还是更不友善了？”他们会变得不那么友善。所以这不是他们回答问题时想到的。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。所以这是一种非常非常具体的感觉。我绝对认为人们彼此更加尊重，很大程度上是因为我们扩大了允许尊重谁的范围，以及控制人们身体和谁可以做出决定的父权观念。我的意思是，我们有很多方式打开了公平和公正的大门。当然，我宁愿活在今天，也不愿活在 50 年前。<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的，我同意。因此，我认为特别令人惊讶的是，我确信还有很多其他人同意这一点。但即使是一些确实同意的人，他们似乎也这么想，<em>是的，但这实际上并不是来自人们的内心</em>。事实上，他们现在彼此之间的关系比以前还要糟糕。<br><br>是的;他们会说所有正确的事情或者他们会有正确的观点。但你知道，他们不会为你敞开大门，否则他们会尽可能地欺骗你。现在人们知道该说些什么，但他们仍然<em>做</em>更多的坏事。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>我们对认识的人有同样的感觉吗？它在我们的个人生活中的表现是否有所不同？<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>实际上你也可以产生一种进步的错觉。实际上，您主要是听到认识的人的好话并体验到好话。所以我们认为，在你的个人世界中，这种衰落的幻觉可能会被拒绝、关闭甚至逆转。<br><br> And people told us: “People in general? Worse today than they were 15 years ago. People that I have known for the last 15 years? Better today than they were 15 years ago.”<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So Julie, one thing that Adam found that I thought was so interesting was that people we know—like our own people, people we&#39;re close to or whatever—they&#39;re somehow getting better over time, and yet the general public are getting worse. I don&#39;t quite understand how those fit together.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> So I guess we just think the moral decline is happening with strangers, with all those <em>other</em> people.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> And it seems like potentially the disconnection from community that many people are experiencing could just mean that we&#39;re slotting more people into the “morally compromised, untrustworthy” category.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right. Like, if we met more people and we had more casual acquaintances and we went to our bowling leagues or whatever, then we might include more people in that circle of people we know. And those people are good people. So that could sort of spiral upward rather than what&#39;s happening, which is a momentum downward.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> Adam&#39;s study kind of seems to say that if you get to know people, then you won&#39;t think they&#39;re on a downward slope of moral depravity anymore.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> For one thing, Adam, it sounds to me like the problem is that people are absolutely certain. Like they&#39;re not questioning. Was the past a worse place? It&#39;s a sort of lack of humility. Because if you try to understand, “Well, maybe what did get worse?,” then you would come up with more specific and useful policy solutions.<br><br> I mean, I assume one reason you did this research is to point out a mistake. Like, we&#39;re all living under this delusion. And in your head—since you sound like a fairly optimistic person—is it “knowledge is power,” and people will know, and then they will stop? What&#39;s the aim, or what&#39;s your wish here?<br><br><strong>马斯楚安尼：</strong>是的。 I mean, as a psychologist I a little bit despair of changing people&#39;s minds, because I know how difficult it is. It doesn&#39;t work the way that we think that it works, like, “Oh, you have the wrong model of the world. How about I give you the correct facts, and now you have the correct model of the world?” When does that ever happen? When has that ever happened to me? Like, never.<br><br> And one effect that I certainly hope that this has is: Whenever politicians or aspiring politicians make the claim that, you know, “Things used to be better, and put me in charge and I&#39;ll make them better again”—that&#39;s a very old thing that we&#39;ve heard many times. And it resonates with us, perhaps because we are primed to believe it, even when it&#39;s not true.<br><br> <strong>Beck:</strong> So, Hanna, now that we know this is an illusion, right, that&#39;s very interesting. But will it actually change how you feel?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I don&#39;t really know. I mean, I feel like as a journalist, it depresses me a little bit because I spent a lot of time researching and marshaling facts, like I did with my brother. And to think that emotions ultimately squash all of that—I don&#39;t really know what to do with that.<br><br><strong>贝克：</strong>是的。<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> But in my own personal life, awareness is helpful. I don&#39;t think any bad can come from understanding your own emotional levers better. It&#39;s not that it immediately leads to a change, but I don&#39;t think it can ever be bad to understand, <em>Oh, I&#39;m having this emotional attachment or strong belief, and that&#39;s leading me to behave in this way.</em> That in and of itself is a small daily miracle. So that&#39;s good enough.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> <em>Listeners, if you enjoyed this conversation with Adam Mastroianni and Julie Beck, and if you generally like learning about these psychological levers that are guiding our choices, Julie hosts a full season of conversations much like this one, on the Atlantic podcast</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/how-to-build-a-happy-life/">How to Talk to People</a> . <em>You can find it wherever you listen to podcasts.</em><br><br> This episode was produced by Becca Rashid.
