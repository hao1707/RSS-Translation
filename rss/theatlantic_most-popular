href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">她昨天报道</a>了这项新研究，讨论如何使美国最富有的学校以及整个美国精英的学生群体多样化。<br><br>首先，这是来自<em>《大西洋月刊》</em>的三个新故事：<br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-evangelical-church-division-politics/674810/">美国福音派教会正处于危机之中。只有一条出路。</a></li><li> <a

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-musk-x-rebrand/674818/">为什么埃隆杀死了那只鸟</a></li><strong>具有推动力的品质</strong><br><br>一组经济学家的一项新研究<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Nontech.pdf">发现了</a>看似明显的相关性：就读精英学校会增加一个人跻身精英社会行列的机会。这项研究由哈佛大学的拉吉·切蒂、哈佛大学的戴维·戴明和布朗大学的约翰·弗里德曼进行，研究了候补学生的成绩，结果表明，与就读美国最好的公立大学之一相比，就读所谓的“ Ivy Plus”团体——常春藤盟校加上斯坦福大学、麻省理工学院、杜克大学和芝加哥大学——将学生在 33 岁时达到收入分配顶端的机会提高了 60%。<br><br>这个发现实际上并不那么明显。过去二十年里，一系列研究表明，从旗舰公立院校毕业的学生与从常春藤+学校毕业后的平均收入大致相同。这项新研究<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf#page=4">证实了关于平均收入的这一发现</a>，但它使更大的图景变得复杂：当谈到美国精英生活的其他指标时——“最高法院书记员职位、进入顶级研究生项目、跻身前 1 名” 33 岁时有收入的人所占的百分比”——哈佛和耶鲁等学校非常重要。 “总的来说，[精英学校]具有这种推动力，”安妮告诉我。<br><br>白人学生，甚至更大程度上是富裕学生在许多精英大学中所占比例过高，自从最高法院决定限制平权行动以来，这些学校如何实现多元化的问题变得更加紧迫。但这项新研究表明，精英学校可以制定一些直接的政策来实现自身多元化，并在此过程中实现美国精英的构成多元化。安妮和我讨论了其中两种可能性。<br><br><b>废除传统招生：</b>近年来，优先考虑大学校友子女的制度<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bowman.house.gov/2022/2/news-rep-jamaal-bowman-sen-jeff-merkley-introduce-legacy-admissions-reform-bill">受到审查</a>，自上个月最高法院裁决以来，这种审查更加严格。今天，教育部表示<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/us/politics/harvard-admissions-civil-rights-inquiry.html">已对哈佛的遗留招生做法展开</a>民权调查。上周，卫斯理大学（我自己的母校）宣布<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/education/4105550-wesleyan-university-ending-legacy-admissions-after-supreme-court-ruling/">停止</a>使用遗留偏好。<br><br><p role="presentation">切蒂和他的合著者的这篇新论文证实了传统招生的影响是真实的，而且对于收入最高的学生来说效果尤其明显。数据显示，与考试成绩相当的非传统学生相比，父母收入分布在前 1% 的传统学生被 Ivy Plus 学校录取的可能性高出 5 倍。与此同时，不太富裕的传统学生被录取的可能性是其他学生的三倍。</p>当我问安妮，她是否认为精英学校的传统招生下降是一种真正的可能性时（麻省理工学院是常春藤加组研究中唯一一所不使用传统偏好的学校），她指出，这很快就会成为一个公共问题。 -政策问题：最高法院裁决后，乔·拜登总统<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2023/06/29/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-supreme-courts-decision-on-affirmative-action/#:~:text=We%20can%20and%20must%20do,expand%20privilege%20instead%20of%20opportunity.">站出来反对</a>这种做法，根据民意调查， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2022/04/26/u-s-public-continues-to-view-grades-test-scores-as-top-factors-in-college-admissions/">大约四分之三</a>的美国人认为大学不应该使用遗产偏好。安妮说，如果大学校长开始一遍又一遍地被问及这一问题，大学可能会开始重新考虑对这种做法的使用，“如果国会议员开始说，‘我们是否需要向这些机构提供所有这些如果他们只是挑选有钱的孩子并给他们更多的优势，那么他们会享受研究经费和所有这些不错的税收减免吗？”<br><br>拜登总统是此时此刻特别有趣的政治人物：正如安妮提醒我的那样，据称拜登并不是一个非常好的学生，他没有像许多过去的总统那样就读于精英大学（他去了特拉华大学）。与此同时，许多国会议员本身就来自精英大学，安妮指出：“最有趣的是，如果这变得政治化，对谁来说它会变得政治化？”<br><br><p role="presentation"><b>增加班级规模：</b>我要求安妮详细阐述她在文章末尾提出的一个令人惊讶的简单论点，切蒂研究中没有明确涵盖这一论点：精英学校可能会招收更多学生。 “这些学校并没有随着美国人口或 18 岁人口的增长而增长，”她告诉我。我们通过电话汇总了统计数据：这些 Ivy Plus 学校每年毕业的学生总数约为 23,000 名。与此同时，美国每年大约有 400 万 18 岁青少年。当然，并非所有这些孩子都会上大学。但 23,000 是“九牛一毛”，安妮说。</p><p role="presentation">这些学校拥有巨大的财政资源——常春藤+学校的捐赠总额超过2000亿美元。此外，许多学校在体育设施和食堂等本质上是“房地产问题”的方面投入了大量资金，安妮说：“认为他们无法教育更多、更多、更多孩子的想法是可笑的。 ”</p><p

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>马里奥·塔玛/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>好莱坞的记忆力一直很差。行业分析师将在数月内预测电影未来的厄运，然后在新上映的影片超出预期时欢欣鼓舞。今年夏天也不例外： <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/06/the-flash-production-issues-muschietti/674334/"><em>《闪电侠》</em></a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/06/indiana-jones-and-the-dial-of-destiny-review/674509/"><em>《夺宝奇兵》</em></a>等几部大片表现不佳， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/04/2023-movie-box-office-needs-strong-second-half-after-inconsistent-start.html">人们</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/disney-box-office-failures-indiana-jones-elemental-ant-man-1235660409/">很快就陷入了</a>绝望。但上周末带来了巨大的转变，这要归功于<em>《巴本海默》</em> ——格蕾塔·葛韦格饰演的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/"><em>芭比娃娃</em></a>和克里斯托弗·诺兰饰演的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/"><em>奥本海默</em></a>的正面交锋。这两部电影是完全不同的、由导演主导的作品，它们使各自的预期票房翻了一番，并共同推动了历史上第四高的首周末票房。夏天可以拯救了！然而，随着演员和编剧的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywoods-cruel-strategy/674730/">罢工</a>持续不断，制片厂似乎几乎一心要粉碎任何真正的行业发展势头的机会。<br><br>让<em>芭比</em>与<em>奥本海默</em>对抗的策略最初似乎很冒险。但葛韦格的亮粉色名牌喜剧与诺兰的 R 级三小时传记史诗之间的差异也引发了炒作。最终， <em>《芭比娃娃》</em>的首映票房为 1.62 亿美元， <em>《奥本海默》</em>的首映票房为 8200 万美元——前者创下了女性导演电影的票房纪录，而诺兰则获得了非蝙蝠侠电影史上最大的周末票房收入。<br><br>在经历了几个月商业上平淡无奇的续集之后，这对电影业来说是一个巨大的、令人振奋的成功。最重要的是，这清楚地表明观众渴望优质产品。大片并没有过时，但电影公司不能仅仅依赖最新的系列作品；一些老牌公司（例如 DC 漫画和<em>速度与激情</em>）开始失去光彩。<em>芭比</em>和<em>奥本海默</em>通过获得积极评价和提供真正引人注目的东西赢得了观众的热情：<em>芭比</em>在人群中非常有趣和快乐；<em>奥本海默的</em>视觉效果令人惊叹，并在 IMAX 等大型优质银幕上提升了其销量。这两部电影都获得了 A 级 CinemaScore，这是口碑的良好指标，因此整个 8 月份的票房应该会保持健康。<br><br>尽管如此，麻烦即将来临，第一个例子也出现在上周末。由<em>赞</em>达亚主演的浪漫网球喜剧《挑战者》 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/zendaya-challengers-actors-strike-release-date-1235444723/">将上映日期</a>从9月15日改为明年4月26日，取消了原定在威尼斯电影节上映的计划。这部电影由卢卡·瓜达格尼诺（《<em>请以你的名字呼唤我</em>》）执导，本来打算在米高梅的影院大肆宣传，但演员工会罢工意味着赞达亚和她的联合主演可能无法宣传这部电影，这会给依赖明星力量的项目带来困难。<br><br>其他几个项目也因罢工而被推迟，包括 A24 的独立喜剧<em>《Problemista》</em> 、狮门影业的励志剧<em>《白鸟》</em>和<em>《辣身舞》</em>续集。但接下来真正的多米诺骨牌可能会倒下，有<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/dune-2-release-date-change-2024-warner-bros-strike-1235676007/">传言</a>称华纳兄弟可能会将其即将上映的大片<em>——《沙丘第二部》</em> 、 <em>《紫色》</em>和<em>《海王与失落的王国</em>》——从 2023 年的日历中剔除。计划于秋季上映的其他大片包括马丁·斯科塞斯的<em>《花月杀手》</em> 、超级英雄电影<em>《奇迹》</em>和《<em>饥饿游戏》</em>前传，所有这些都需要明星在新闻发布会上来推动其销售。 （<em>芭比</em>和<em>奥本海默</em>的演员们在罢工之前接受了许多媒体采访。）<br><br>危机不仅正在酝酿，而且还在酝酿之中。它在这里。电影制片厂不与美国演员工会和美国作家协会恢复谈判的每一天都会危及好莱坞的未来。新冠疫情造成的连年延误加剧了人们对电影的生存焦虑：更多的电影被分发到流媒体服务，观众也习惯了在家观看新上映的电影。现在人们又可以放心地去看电影了，<em>巴本海默</em>现象正在提醒各个年龄段的观众，大银幕体验的价值。不利用这种能量将是一个灾难性的错误。<br><br>然而，这似乎是电影和电视制片人联盟（代表主要制片厂的松散贸易协会）愿意犯的错误。 WGA 已经罢工 84 天，没有迹象表明短期内会恢复谈判。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/writers-strike-hollywood-studios-deal-fight-wga-actors-1235434335/"><em>Deadline 的</em>一篇文章</a>援引一位匿名“顶级制片人”的话说，制片厂将允许僵局至少持续到十月。 AMPTP 予以反击，声称其“致力于达成协议”。不管怎样，这篇报道强调了 WGA 和制片厂之间的关系已经变得多么有害。残差、生成人工智能的使用以及流数据的共享都是重要的分歧点。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywoods-cruel-strategy/674730/">阅读：商人打破了好莱坞</a><br><br>多年来，娱乐业经历了多次 WGA 罢工，但 SAG 的行动更令人惊讶，并且立即产生了影响，基本上关闭了所有主要电影制作并影响了未来的上映时间表。许多相同的问题，特别是流媒体残差和人工智能，在两组谈判中都处于危险之中，这可能就是为什么 AMPTP 不愿意与 SAG 快速讨价还价的原因——它知道 WGA 可以利用这一点作为杠杆。相反，好莱坞大佬们似乎陷入了死亡漩涡，除了对工会和他们自己施加惩罚之外，不知道如何推动达成协议。<br><br>在这一点上，解决罢工问题的任何拖延对电影业来说都可能是世界末日。如果电影公司将谈判推迟数月，试图迫使工会陷入绝望，那么这些电影公司的产品最终将被电影院扣留，整体票房收入将直线下降，而这可能是好莱坞达到大流行前水平的最佳机会成功的喜悦将会溜走。是的， <em>《芭比娃娃》</em>和<em>《奥本海默》</em>将继续售票，八月份的几部动作片（ <em>《忍者神龟</em>》、 <em>《巨齿鲨 2</em> 》）应该会取得一定的成功，但目前所有关于票房的公司都将很快就忘记了。好莱坞刚刚得到了自 2019 年以来最明确的确认：电影仍然可以吸引现场观众。继续释放它们是个好主意。<br><br></div>

“世界就像，<em>我不在乎</em>，”她开玩笑说。<br><br>但全世界都非常关心他所出演的电影。自周五上映以来， <em>《芭比娃娃》的</em><a data-event-element="inline link"

<em>《芭比娃娃</em>》的大规模首映使这部电影成为葛韦格作为导演迄今为止最成功的票房作品。然而，这部电影完全符合葛韦格的全部作品：就像 2017 年的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2017/11/lady-bird-greta-gerwig-review/544721/"><em>《伯德小姐</em></a>》和 2019 年的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/"><em>《小妇人》</em></a>一样，它深入思考了如何表达女性气质。葛韦格与搭档诺亚·鲍姆巴赫 (Noah Baumbach) 共同创作的<em>《芭比娃娃》的分量</em>可能出乎意料地沉重。在闪闪发光的服装和盛大派对的背后是一个可爱的人文主义故事，它研究产品如何影响和反映我们是谁。<br><br>也许这听起来很崇高，但考虑一下芭比（玛格特·罗比饰）和肯在现实世界中的冒险，这在电影中不仅仅是鱼出水狂欢的机会。两人肩负着在一个对待男性和女性不同的社会中生存的艰巨任务：芭比作为一个代表理想女性的玩具，与她有缺陷的目的作斗争；肯（Ken）是专为芭比娃娃的手臂糖果而创造的，他通过观察人类第一次尝到了力量的滋味，并误解了他所看到的。<em>芭比娃娃</em>既顽皮又深思熟虑，充满笑话，常常超现实的奇观包裹着真诚、女权主义和彻底的葛韦格风格的核心。<br><br>然而，当我们周五早上交谈时，葛韦格并不知道<em>芭比娃娃</em>会如何着陆。正如她所说，她预计自己会“整天焦虑不安”，并且渴望聊天，而不是担心电影的反响。我们讨论了她电影中的主题，以及她在芭比乐园的经历教会了她什么。 （别担心，Ken 的粉丝们。我们最终会找到他的。）<br><br><em>为了篇幅和清晰度，本次对话已被编辑。</em><br><br><strong>雪莉·李：</strong>这部<em>芭比娃娃</em>电影中有很多关于自我价值的重要想法，以及我们消费的东西（或者玩玩偶的东西）如何影响我们成为什么样的人。我注意到一个小女孩在放映时问了很多问题；她似乎对那些令人兴奋的主题感到有点困惑，但玩得很开心，尤其是当娃娃们唱歌跳舞时。所以我很好奇：当你和诺亚写这部电影时，你把谁想象成你的观众？<br><br><strong>格蕾塔·葛韦格：</strong>我并没有强烈的感觉，<em>这是给孩子们的东西；这是给孩子们看的。这是成人的东西</em>。我知道有些东西更令人兴奋，但当我回顾小时候的观看经历时，往往那些超出我范围的东西是最引人注目的，因为它们感觉就像一扇小窗户，让我进入了我所看到的世界。正在兴起。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>比如什么？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>这是一个非常奇怪、非常具体的记忆，但当我五岁的时候，我爸爸在纽约工作，我和妈妈得到了去<em>吉普赛</em>的加急票。我大部分都听不懂，但是当吉普赛<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wErVF7QwIY&amp;ab_channel=ProjectUnleash">在滑稽俱乐部表演</a>时，这些脱衣舞娘穿着闪闪发光的老式脱衣舞服装，我很喜欢。我不明白发生了什么，但我们得到了一本很大的纪念书，我记得只是研究了所有脱衣舞娘所在的页面，因为我认为它们是<em>如此</em>美丽。我没有任何感觉他们被客观化了。我只是喜欢他们穿着这些漂亮、闪闪发光的衣服和大头饰。我可能有很多这样的回忆。<br><br><strong>李：</strong> <em>《伯德小姐》</em>是根据你自己的经历写的， <em>《小妇人</em>》是你从小就喜欢看的书，小时候也玩过芭比娃娃。用你的电影来重温童年的试金石对你来说是一个有意的选择吗？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>老实说，在制作它们的过程中，我一直隐藏着一些东西，因为从表面上看，它们看起来很不同。但现在我看完了这个，我发现他们都在围绕着这个想法。 [<em>笑。</em> 】 你对你感兴趣的东西感兴趣，我对女人感兴趣。但我也认为——这听起来有点愚蠢——我的一个痴迷，可以说是，我真的有点不敢相信我们生活在线性时间里。 [<em>笑。</em> ] 这真是令人震惊。显然，当你有一个孩子时，你会与这个孩子紧密相连，但你在生活中也可以与它相连。<br><br>我认为，在试图将它们整合在一起并了解你现在在哪里以及你曾经去过哪里的过程中，总是会感到<em>痛苦</em>。显然，这就是我改编<em>《小妇人》</em>的方式，因为我突然<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/">以一种我年轻时从未见过的方式将这些角色视为</a>成年人。 <em>《伯德小姐》</em>是一个关于一名高中生的故事，有些事情你觉得很重要，比如舞会，但实际上这是关于你的母亲和你的<em>离开</em>。这是我回归的话题，因为无论如何，电影本质上就是一个时间胶囊，所以它已经及时处理了。这就是我在智力和艺术上感兴趣的东西，而媒介本身似乎已经嵌入了这一点。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/12/greta-gerwigs-little-women-finally-gives-amy-her-due/603886/">阅读：格蕾塔·葛韦格的<em>《小妇人》</em>终于给了艾米应得的</a><br><br><strong>李：</strong>也许更好的说法是：你的电影都是关于女孩如何学习成为女人的。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>哦，<em>是的</em>！<br><br><strong>李：</strong>我是不是把事情想得太简单了？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>不，我喜欢它！那好美丽。 [<em>笑。</em> ] 不过，也许这就是你永远要做的事情。我不知道那是你到达的地方。这当然与年龄无关，因为它永远在展开。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>那么，你对少女时代最关心的是什么，拍这些电影也许可以帮助你理解？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>嗯，把它拆开是很困难的，但对我来说，这很大程度上与代际对话有关。当我想到我的祖母、我的母亲、我的时候，女性的生活已经发生了如此巨大的变化，我不知道接下来会发生什么变化，但我们不断互相学习。再过一周我就满 40 岁了，我开始以一种美妙的方式感觉到，我属于年轻女性回望的那一代，这种感觉美妙又奇怪。我确实认为这是一种让我能够深入地参与对话的方式，让我感觉值得拥有，无论是女性气质、人格还是线性时间中的存在。 [<em>笑。</em> ] 线性时间是我真正的一个难题。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>你说过制作这部电影就像你制作的任何其他电影一样个人化。有没有一个场景让你觉得这部电影对你来说非常个人化？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>从<em>芭比娃娃</em>徽标的字体（我一直被泡泡字母版本所吸引，部分原因是我在玩具“反”斗城看到的那个字体）到凯特·麦金农（Kate McKinnon）的角色非常重要这一事实，一切都包罗万象。反映了我拥有的芭比娃娃，一个被人喜爱的娃娃，但在盒子里不再处于原始完美的状态。芭比在长凳上看到的那个女人是我的朋友，杰出的服装设计师安·罗斯。我一直在思考面孔，当你看着她的面孔时，我想你看到了一种感觉就像是一种生活，而那个年龄不仅在其持续时间上有价值。<br><br> [当芭比娃娃和她的创造者牵手时]，所有这些视频剪辑都是从所有参与这部电影的人那里拍摄的——女性、母亲、姐妹、女儿、朋友。我坚信，即使你不知道电影中的内容，我认为你也能感受到它们。我一直很喜欢在<em>《好家伙》</em>中，马丁·斯科塞斯的母亲扮演妈妈。你不知道那是他的妈妈，但你觉得她就是那个人，而且感觉很私人。在某种程度上，这与一个孩子看电影时无法理解每一个参考内容，但以某种方式<em>感受到</em>它并没有什么不同。其中嵌入的个人信息是人们无意识收集的一部分。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>说到那些视频片段，我们再谈谈结局。你能告诉我关于让芭比娃娃和肯夫妇达成的决定吗？这不是一个最终的解决方案，而是一种缓和的方式？伊萨·雷饰演的芭比总统不允许肯在最高法院任职。他们还在想办法。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>我们<em>都</em>还在想办法——这只是其中的一部分。但我唯一能给任何人的就是他们仍然处于混乱之中。也许这对肯斯来说会好一点。你不想告诉人们如何观看事物，但在电影的结尾，制作设计将肯的一些迷恋融入了芭比乐园。就像，完美​​并不像开始将所有东西混合在一起那样美丽。我记得当我们去拍摄结局时，当我们都走在片场时，我们就像，<em>这是有史以来最美丽的</em>。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>你能告诉我为什么肯最终拒绝父权制吗？有趣的是，他承认他不明白。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong> [<em>沉默</em>]<br><br><strong>李：</strong>哦，不。格蕾塔，我失去你了吗？你好？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>嗨，好吧，我不知道发生了什么事。它就这样消失了。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>没关系。我觉得很有趣的是，一个关于肯的问题导致你挂断了电话。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong> [<em>笑。</em> ] 世界就像是，“我不在乎。”<br><br><strong>李：</strong>是的，“我们继续吧。”所以我想问：肯实际上并不想接管芭比乐园的想法从何而来？这部电影小心翼翼地将他描绘成一个被误导的反派，而不是一个怀恨在心的对手。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>嗯，在某种程度上，你会无意识地做事情，然后再将它们拼凑起来，但有一个元素让你感觉最后，你想要从自己手中被拯救出来。我猜它的黑暗反乌托邦版本是<em>《蝇王》</em> ，就像《野孩子》一样。他们是洋娃娃，但在心理上他们也是孩子。<br><br>事实上，我想到了我的继子。当他年轻的时候，他只是不睡觉。有一次，我走进他的卧室，他站在床上，把他的毛绒玩具扔来扔去，他尖叫道：“我希望有人能让我停下来！”它是如此纯粹[<em>笑</em>]，就像，实际上，他是对的！他希望有人能让他停下来。当瑞恩·高斯林和我谈论他将如何演绎结局时，我谈到了很多关于我 4 岁儿子的事情。如果他哭了，你说：“哈罗德，我们不得不离开公园，你感到不安吗？”他会说：“是啊啊，是啊啊。”就像，他承认[他的悲伤]，但即使只是这样做也<em>很难</em>，那种情感的品质。<br><br>显然，这些系统对男性来说也很糟糕。当<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">美国发表美丽的演讲</a>时，我只是在抽泣，然后我环顾四周，发现片场里每个人都在哭。男人们也在哭，因为他们有自己的演讲，他们觉得自己永远无法发表，你知道吗？他们有自己的双钢丝，这也很痛苦。其中一些结构就是，你知道，“有人让我停下来！”我想这就是肯背后的感觉。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">阅读：理解<em>芭比</em>电影的令人惊讶的关键</a><br><br><strong>李：</strong>这是一部如此庞大的电影，也是你职业生涯中压力很大的时刻。作为一个电影人，你现在掌握着很大的权力，我想问你打算用它做什么？<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong> [<em>笑。</em> ]<em>我想做什么？</em>成为一名电影制片人是一件了不起的事情，因为拍电影很困难，你永远无法真正登上山顶。因为无论你接下来要制作什么，你都还没有制作过——所以你会学到关于<em>这部</em>电影你不知道的东西，你知道吗？这很困难，但这也是吸引力的一部分。但是，如果你幸运的话，你只会每两年、三年、四年拍一部电影。所以，如果你开始计算人生，你就会意识到，<em>我要做什么，拍 15 部电影？</em>你知道，不是太多。但如果我幸运的话，我就能过上一种像我希望做的任何事情一样有意义的生活。我<em>确实</em>想在 60 多岁和 70 多岁时拍电影，如果上帝愿意，也许我会在 80 多岁时拍一些极其奇怪的电影。<br><br><strong>李：</strong>既然你已经完成了大预算工作室的主力，你认为你的故事讲述会如何发展？我想你并不总是在做生活中的数学。<br><br><strong>葛韦格：</strong>我希望能够制作各种规模的电影。我喜欢拥有制作微小东西的技能，也喜欢拥有用最大的画笔绘画的技能。它总是关于什么能给你最大的创造性自由，这可能意味着不同的事情。<br><br>我也感到非常幸运，能够成长为更大的人。我在 20 多岁的时候与人共同编剧、共同导演、演过很多戏，我就是利用这些来开始执导的。 <em>《小妇人》</em>是一个中间步骤，当我想到年轻的电影制作人时，取决于你想做什么，如果你有兴趣看看它如何扩展或收缩，那么这些中级电影的制作是令人难以置信的。我非常感激我能做到这一点，因为没有它我就不可能做到<em>这一点</em>。<br><br></div>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-07-24/ty-article/.premium/prime-minister-netanyahu-is-out-of-touch-with-israels-protesters-and-reservists/00000189-84de-d95c-a7ab-fdffc76a0000"><em>报》</em></a>上所写的那样，对军事准备的潜在损害是严重的，而黎巴嫩真主党和其他组织看到了机会。<br><br> Although there is no threat of the military disobeying civilian orders, or even a call for it to do so, individual military service has long been seen as an apolitical act in a country with ostensibly universal conscription, and a military with widely diverse political opinions. The government&#39;s supporters view the protest of the reservists as a betrayal of the common Israeli code; its opponents view it as a sign that the Netanyahu government is tearing apart that code. Refusing to defend the state is a doomsday weapon, but a large segment of Israeli society believes it faces a democratic doomsday.<br><br> Ironically, the best explanation of the current situation came from Bezalel Smotrich, the far-right minister of finance and member of the security cabinet. Back in March, in response to a terrorist attack against an Israeli settlement, violent youth from those settlements rampaged through the Palestinian town of Huwara—an outburst that the Israeli general in charge called a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/15/middleeast/huwara-west-bank-settler-attack-cmd-intl/index.html">pogrom</a> . Smotrich <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/israel-should-wipe-out-palestinian-town-of-huwara-says-senior-minister-smotrich/">condemned</a> the vigilante violence in an interview, but said that the Palestinian town should be “wiped out” by the state instead.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/02/israel-palestine-west-bank-illegal-settlement-netanyahu/672944/">Read: From this hill, you can see the next Intifada</a><br><br> During the ensuing uproar, Smotrich was approached by a friend, an Israeli-air-force pilot, who, Smotrich said, enlightened him about the damage his words had done. In an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/article-733756">apology</a> of sorts, Smotrich expressed his shock that he had been understood to have meant precisely what he indeed said. He did, however, spell out what had horrified so many in the military. Once a fringe far-right activist, Smotrich had become a senior cabinet minister, in a country where the cabinet is the collective commander in chief of the military. Pilots and others in the military are handed immense firepower, Smotrich&#39;s friend explained, and they rely on the political leadership and state institutions to issue only morally defensible orders. Given the extreme positions taken by members of the Netanyahu cabinet, and its energetic efforts to limit all checks on its authority, military personnel were left to guess whether a senior cabinet minister was actually planning to order them to commit a war crime. That situation, for many, became untenable.<br><br> More broadly, many in Israel sense a breakdown of the social contract. If Israel is not fully democratic, then the state—which holds together a remarkably <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/tribes-identity-and-individual-freedom-in-israel/">diverse</a> Jewish population—can come undone. For Israel&#39;s Arab citizens, the struggle to find their place in Israeli society has been all the more difficult, but their economic, social, and political gains in recent years are also threatened as judicial limits to the rule of a political majority that usually excludes them are removed.<br><br> Netanyahu supporters also sense a crisis. They see the breadth and strength of the protests against the reforms, and the refusal of reservists to volunteer, as efforts to subvert majority rule. They won the last election, they feel, and now the opposition is using extra-electoral means to prevent their preferred policies from being enacted. At their own protests, they have embraced the slogan “Second-class citizen,” a complaint that their votes count for less and their electoral mandates are regarded as illegitimate. Netanyahu supporters, on average, come from lower socioeconomic strata of society, and feel that established elites are fighting to retain their hold on the country in the face of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ynetnews.com/article/bjqulftg2">demographic</a> trends that favor Netanyahu&#39;s coalition.<br><br> Ignoring the views of the large <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://en.idi.org.il/articles/47968">minority</a> that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-752172">supports</a> the government would be a mistake, yet there are two major flaws in its narrative. The first is that Netanyahu&#39;s government is not just pursuing a set of controversial policies but seeking to implement constitutional change. Securing a slender majority in an election should not suffice to make sweeping changes to a country&#39;s constitution. Israeli law grants a small or temporary majority the same constitutional power as a broad coalition, and allows swift constitutional changes, but it should still seek consensus and exercise self-restraint, not just as a matter of fairness but to safeguard the integrity of the polity.<br><br> Second, Netanyahu and many of his supporters have confused majoritarianism with democracy. These are not the same thing. As I <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/israels-majoritarian-nightmare-should-be-a-us-concern/">wrote</a> in February, democracy is the rule of the people, the <em>demos</em> , all of it, including the minority. Democracy is not a license for the majority to do as it wishes, with no guardrails.<br><br> Netanyahu supporters often claim that they have no tyrannical intentions. In private and in public, they greet any suggestion that they might abuse human or civil rights <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/events/3256199581377447/?acontext=%7B%22ref%22%3A%2252%22%2C%22action_history%22%3A%22%5b%7B%5C%22surface%5C%22%3A%5C%22share_link%5C%22%2C%5C%22mechanism%5C%22%3A%5C%22share_link%5C%22%2C%5C%22extra_data%5C%22%3A%7B%5C%22invite_link_id%5C%22%3A511218184399898%7D%7D%5d%22%7D">indignantly</a> . Israel, however, also happens to control much of the lives of Palestinians in the West Bank, for whom this argument rings hollow. They have seen otherwise. And although the current checks on executive action have had only a limited effect within the West Bank, there is a reason the ideological elements of the settler movement are so keen on the judicial overhaul. Without any checks, things could be far worse.<br><br> Moreover, good intentions are not enough in constitutional arrangements. Institutions, constraints, and the rule of law are also essential. Israel doesn&#39;t need good intentions; it requires the messiness of real democracy.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 18:11:13 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-limit-supreme-court-power-protests/674819/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/israel-limit-supreme-court-power-protests/674819/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Oppenheimer’s Cry of Despair in The Atlantic]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> At the dawn of America&#39;s arms race with the Soviet Union, all the great scientist could do was plead for hope. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/AjNA1aT674UuHHRmJHHbtxriWlM=/0x0:3596x2023/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/opp_atlwriter/original.jpg" alt="J·罗伯特·奥本海默抽烟" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Universal Images / Getty</figcaption></figure> In February of 1949, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the former director of Los Alamos Laboratory under the Manhattan Project, took to the pages of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1949/02/the-open-mind/305431/">this magazine</a> to write about a terrible defeat. Nearly four years had passed since the Manhattan Project had detonated the first atomic bomb in New Mexico. The explosion had flashed purple light onto the surrounding mountains and raised a 40,000-foot pillar of flame, smoke, and debris from the desert floor. But for Oppenheimer, the afterglow had quickly dimmed and been replaced by an existential hangover of the first order.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1949/02/the-open-mind/305431/">From February 1949: J. Robert Oppenheimer&#39;s &#39;The Open Mind&#39;</a><br><br> The most gutting stretch of Christopher Nolan&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/oppenheimer-movie-review-christopher-nolan/674749/">new Oppenheimer biopic</a> occurs when the great scientist, played by Cillian Murphy, begins to experience the disenchantment that would haunt him for the rest of his life. As he watches two bombs rumble away on trucks from his desert lab toward Japan, any illusion that their terrible power is under his control is punctured. Hiroshima was bombed three weeks after the Trinity test. In the film, a sickened Oppenheimer averts his gaze from photos of its disfigured victims. Like Nolan&#39;s camera, he cannot bear to look.<br><br> Oppenheimer would later say that through the bomb, physicists had come to know sin. Having plucked a dangerous fruit from the tree of knowledge, they consigned themselves—and all of humanity—to a fallen world, tormented by the constant possibility of self-extinction. In the war&#39;s immediate aftermath, Oppenheimer consoled, or perhaps deceived, himself that his invention&#39;s apocalyptic potential could and would be contained, in part through his efforts.<br><br> Oppenheimer had reason to believe in his influence. The public had embraced his personal legend: Inflamed by a fear of a nuclear-armed Hitler, he had ventured into the invisible realm of atoms and returned with a tremendous power, capable of stopping a war cold and returning sons to their mothers. Honors were heaped upon him. In Nolan&#39;s film, we watch as Oppenheimer is courted for a plush role: director of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the academic home of Albert Einstein. Oppenheimer also chaired the committee tasked with advising the US Atomic Energy Commission. During the latter half of the 1940s, his pronouncements on matters of science had a singular gravitas. “Certainly he knows as much about the potential of atomic energy as any living American,” reads an editor&#39;s note atop his essay for <em>The Atlantic</em> .<br><br> What did he do with this outsize voice? He opposed the development of a much more powerful, second-generation atomic weapon—the hydrogen bomb, which Edward Teller called the “super”—in part because he was concerned it would accelerate an arms race with the Soviet Union. He also lent his prestige and credibility to ongoing efforts to avoid that arms race altogether. He helped draft the proposals that evolved into the Baruch Plan, an arms-control regime that the United States put before the United Nations. Under the latter&#39;s direction, all countries would forfeit their atomic-weapons programs, and atomic energy would be a global collective good, administered by a centralized regulatory body at the UN, over which no country would enjoy a veto.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/07/us-nuclear-strategy-cold-war-russia/638441/">Read: We have no nuclear strategy</a><br><br> After the final failure of these proposals at the UN, in 1948, Oppenheimer turned, as one does, to <em>The Atlantic</em> . His essay is a fascinating historical artifact and act of public grief. Titled “The Open Mind,” it lays out Oppenheimer&#39;s account of the back-and-forth over arms-control proposals. Soviet leaders had voted against them, but their response had not been wholly negative. They agreed that all countries should dismantle their atomic-weapons programs and that atomic energy should fall under international oversight. But they objected, perhaps understandably, to America&#39;s insistence on keeping its weapons program running until the new system was functional. They wanted President Harry Truman to disarm first, a condition that he could not abide.<br><br> During the Manhattan Project, Oppenheimer&#39;s powers of foresight had failed him. However accurate his calculations concerning the innards of the atom, he&#39;d misjudged what would happen geopolitically after he and his colleagues wrenched it apart. Out of naivete, or the expedient blindness of ambition, or some combination of the two, he may have believed that he could stop its further use after the Nazis had been defeated, or that the terrifying spectacle of the bomb would eventually lead to a renunciation of ever larger weapons and wars.<br><br> In 1949, he understood that no such renunciation was in store. “We see no clear course before us that would persuade the governments of the world to join with us” in atomic disarmament, he wrote. This time, the implications were obvious, and they implicated America, which, as Oppenheimer laments, “responded by adopting some of the very measures that we had hoped might be universally renounced.” The mass manufacture of the atomic bomb was under way and American scientists had clear orders to put the new physics in service of even more destructive weapons.<br><br> Oppenheimer saw a cosmically bleak arms race taking shape, and this time his  foresight proved accurate. Within months, the Soviet Union successfully tested its first atomic bomb, and only three years later, in 1952, the United States detonated a hydrogen bomb roughly 500 times as powerful as the one that had largely destroyed Nagasaki. The Soviets followed suit a few years later, and by the time of Oppenheimer&#39;s death, in 1967, the two countries had nearly 40,000 nuclear weapons between them, many of them <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">set on a hair trigger</a> .<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ai-warfare-nuclear-weapons-strike/673780/">Read: Never give artificial intelligence the nuclear codes</a><br><br> Oppenheimer knew that he&#39;d helped to conjure this world into existence. He sought to prepare our readers for its horrors. In the main, his advice was to not lose hope, and to remember that our imagination of the future is limited. Oppenheimer was perhaps heartened by the quantum world, shot through as it is with uncertainty, that had captivated him in his youth. He seemed to draw strength from a belief that the macro world of human affairs is likewise contingent, such that nothing about our fate is ever settled.<br><br> Oppenheimer quotes from a speech that Abraham Lincoln gave in Baltimore three years into the Civil War. At the beginning of that conflict, few expected that “domestic slavery would be much affected,” Lincoln said, and yet it had been. Reality is unpredictable; it will surprise you. Lincoln reminded Oppenheimer that surprises swing both ways. A world that appears to be fallen can sometimes veer toward moral progress.<br><br> We have seen such swerves before, even in the nuclear realm. By the 1980s, enormous arsenals of nuclear weapons appeared to be a fact of life on planet Earth. In 1986, the Soviet Union&#39;s stockpile reached an all-time high of about 40,000 warheads, and the United States had more than 20,000. Very few people imagined that the end of the Cold War was imminent. Nor could many have guessed that in 1991, George HW Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev would sign the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the first in an extraordinary sequence of agreements that shrank the two countries&#39; arsenals to less than a quarter of their previous size.<br><br> Bush and Gorbachev were wise to seize the day, because that era&#39;s peace—and its clean two-party strategic symmetry—proved ephemeral. The specter of nuclear annihilation has since returned with force to the global collective psyche. Vladimir Putin has invoked it in speeches about his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://Read:%20What%20if%20Russia%20uses%20nuclear%20weapons%20in%20Ukraine?">invasion of Ukraine</a> . China has built up an arsenal that may be large enough to destroy every major American city.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/russia-ukraine-nuclear-weapon-us-response/661315/">Read: What if Russia uses nuclear weapons in Ukraine?</a><br><br> As Oppenheimer well understood, there is no <em>technological</em> reason that world-threatening stockpiles of nuclear weapons will not be with us for hundreds of thousands of years. To keep large numbers of them in place for that long, in a strategic setting where any small exchange could very easily become a large one, is to play a fool&#39;s game. No one should feel safe because seven decades have passed without another incident of nuclear warfare; that sample size is too small.<br><br> Beyond advising hope, Oppenheimer didn&#39;t offer much guidance as to how we might dismantle the sword of Damocles that he helped to string up above human civilization. A notorious dandy and eloquent impromptu speaker, he was always drawn to style; in his <em>Atlantic</em> essay, he invokes it in a higher form. “It is style,” he wrote, “which, in the domain of foreign policy, enables us to find a harmony between the pursuit of ends essential to us, and the regard for the views, the sensibilities, the aspirations of those to whom the problem may appear in another light.”<br><br> The problem Oppenheimer had in mind was arms control. He asked that those who negotiate on America&#39;s behalf carry out their work in a spirit of openness. He asked that they appeal to the reasoning minds of those who sit across the table. He appears to have believed—or to have wanted to believe—that a widespread adoption of this style might be enough to set into motion a new evolutionary step in geopolitics, through which the world&#39;s major powers might come to a shared understanding that peace is the highest wisdom. To this end, he counseled patience. Time and nature must be allowed to do their work, he noted.

For years, the prompt in the text box at the top of the page read, “What&#39;s happening?,” a friendly invitation for users to share their thoughts. Eight months after the billionaire&#39;s takeover, Twitter <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mollybohannon/2023/05/12/heres-how-twitters-appearance-has-changed-under-elon-musk/?sh=76231c985f68">changed</a> the prompt ever so slightly to match the puzzling, chaotic nature of the platform under the new regime: “What&#39;s happening?” became “What is happening?!”<br><br> This question, with its exclamatory urgency, has never been more relevant to Twitter than in the past 48 hours, when Musk decided to nuke 17 years&#39; worth of brand awareness and rename the thing. The artist formerly known as Twitter is now X. <em>What is happening?!</em> indeed.<br><br> I have three answers to that question, beyond the simple “Nothing much.” (Even with its new name, the site is pretty much the same as ever; the blue bird logo in the left-hand corner of the website is now a black <em>X</em> , and … that&#39;s about it.) This X boondoggle may simply be the flailing of a man who doesn&#39;t want to own his social network and was pressured via lawsuit to buy it, but Musk and the Twitter (X?) CEO, Linda Yaccarino, would like you to believe that much bigger things are coming.<br><br> <strong>1. Musk wants to build the “Internet of Elon.”</strong><br><br> The first theory requires taking Musk&#39;s ambitions somewhat seriously. In a tweet last October, he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1577428272056389633">declared</a> that “buying Twitter is an accelerant to creating X, the everything app.” Versions of these “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/technology/2023/4/18/23687125/elon-musk-twitter-x-super-app-wechat">super apps</a> ” already exist and are popular in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, so we know what this means: X would function as a holistic platform that includes payment processing and banking, ride-sharing, news, communication with friends, and loads and loads of commerce. Think of it as the internet, but without leaving Musk&#39;s walled garden. In a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/recode/23171541/leaked-transcript-elon-musk-first-meeting-twitter-employees">leaked</a> recording of a Twitter town hall back in June 2022, Musk hinted that China&#39;s WeChat was a model of sorts for X. “There&#39;s no WeChat movement outside of China,” he said. “And I think that there&#39;s a real opportunity to create that. You basically live on WeChat in China because it&#39;s so useful and so helpful to your daily life. And I think if we could achieve that, or even close to that with Twitter, it would be an immense success.”<br><br> If you squint, you can see the logic. Plenty of people across Twitter—influencers, freelancers, small-business owners—use the platform to sell things. Many of these people use various “link in bio” pages to direct people to their work and receive payment. X, the theoretical everything app, could streamline and consolidate these exchanges, and, like WeChat, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/wechat-statistics/">generate revenue</a> from them. Musk has already launched a program to share ad revenue with some of Twitter&#39;s larger “creator” accounts, the early beneficiaries of which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/twitter-creators-payments-right-wing/">included</a> many prominent right-wing shock jocks. And if he could manage to get hundreds of millions of people to live and shop and bank on his app, instead of, say, shitpost memes and argue politics with white nationalists, that would be an immense success.<br><br> To do that, X would need to build out an advanced, secure payment platform; apply the appropriate regulatory licenses to legally process payments and store money; and, of course, recruit businesses and financial institutions to use the platform. According to the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/9d84d534-b2dd-4cff-85d1-aee137b26a45"><em>Financial Times</em></a> , the company began filing applications for those licenses early this year and has been at work building parts of a payment infrastructure. The bad news is that the person Musk tasked with spearheading the project was laid off—along with about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/04/12/tech/elon-musk-bbc-interview-twitter-intl-hnk/index.html">80 percent</a> of Twitter&#39;s workforce.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/02/elon-musk-twitter-ethics-algorithm-biases/673110/">Read: I watched Elon Musk kill Twitter&#39;s culture from the inside</a><br><br> Musk does have experience in the payments business. He founded an online bank—also called X.com—in 1999, and it shortly thereafter merged with Confinity to become PayPal. Perhaps this would give his super-app idea some credibility, if not for Musk having spent the past 15 months blundering through his latest business venture in full view of the public. He has alienated advertisers with his reactionary and conspiratorial political opinions, sent the company deep into debt, and, at times, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-outage-elon-musk-user-restrictions/674609/">rendered the platform unusable</a> by limiting how many tweets users can see. The platform appears to be shrinking under Musk&#39;s leadership, according to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/twitter-traffic-falls-under-elon-musk-threads-mastodon-bluesky-competition/">third-party</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/eastdakota/status/1678065025750294532?s=20">traffic data</a> . Spam <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/09/technology/elon-musk-twitter-spam-bots.html">is</a> rampant, and the most satisfied users seem to be previously banned racists and anti-Semites who have regained access to their megaphone.<br><br> It&#39;s already a hard sell for Musk to convince people that his sputtering platform is the best place for posting <em>Barbenheimer</em> memes, let alone the right home for … everything, including our money. But the cognitive dissonance between Musk&#39;s reputational hemorrhaging and his grand ambitions is easier to bridge when you consider the second way to explain X, which is that it&#39;s a desperate shot in the dark.<br><br> <strong>2. X is <em>pseudoware</em> —just buzzwords and a logo.</strong><br><br> Unlike Facebook&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-mark-zuckerberg/620538/">pivot to Meta</a> , which was oriented around a real (though flawed and unappealing) virtual-reality product, X is a rebrand built on little more than a vague collection of buzzwords cobbled together to form a complete sentence. On Sunday, Yaccarino <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/lindayacc/status/1683213895463215104?s=20">described</a> the forthcoming app as “the future state of unlimited interactivity” that is “centered in audio, video, messaging, payments/banking—creating a global marketplace for ideas, goods, services, and opportunities.” She also noted that, “powered by AI, X will connect us all in ways we&#39;re just beginning to imagine.” (Yaccarino did not respond to a request for comment.)<br><br> Her tweet is a near-perfect example of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/630ec150bcbd490021b17eab/business-dudes-need-to-stop-talking-like-this/">business-dude <em>lorem ipsum</em></a> —corporate gibberish that sounds superficially intelligent but is actually obfuscating. What is “unlimited interactivity?” How will X be “powered by AI”? Does she mean generative AI like ChatGPT or standard algorithms of the sort that have powered Twitter&#39;s “For you” feed for years? The particulars are irrelevant: The words just need to sound like <em>something</em> when strung together.<br><br> Musk, too, is guilty of such blabber. He has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/WatcherGuru/status/1683324036950966273?s=20">argued</a> that his hypothetical project, if built correctly, could “become half of the global financial system.” This is the empty language of a dilettante, the equivalent of me telling you that this article, if written correctly, is on pace to win the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism, or that I am the executive wordsmith for <em>The Atlantic</em> ’s Words About Computers section.<br><br> Musk&#39;s and Yaccarino&#39;s descriptions of X don&#39;t just suggest <em>vaporware</em> , an industry term for a hyped-up product that never materializes. They feel like something else, too: I&#39;d call it <em>pseudoware</em> . Like a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/galaxy-brain/6258e039dc551a00208cc5e1/elon-musk-meme-stocks-and-retail-investing-for-the-superrich/">pseudo-event</a> , pseudoware masquerades as something newsworthy, even though it is not. Yaccarino&#39;s Mad Libs–ian tweetstorm is the press release for this pseudo-event: big talk for a pivot that has so far manifested in ornamental changes. Musk&#39;s first orders of business have been to adopt a new logo and to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1683541303680987136?s=20">project</a> it in conference rooms at headquarters. When Yaccarino tweeted that “X will connect us all in ways we&#39;re just beginning to imagine,” I take her at her word: No one seems to have spent much time thinking about any of this.<br><br> It&#39;s natural to wonder why the world&#39;s richest man would spend his time dismantling one of the world&#39;s most recognizable social-media brands in favor of an inscrutable super app nobody asked for. He could, at any moment, jet off to a private island and drink bottomless piña coladas while giggling about Dogecoin instead! Herein lies the third and most important explanation for X, which is that it is a reputational line of credit for Musk.<br><br> <strong>3. Musk needs to save face.</strong><br><br> Musk&#39;s reputation is dependent on people believing that he can gin up new categories of industry and see around corners to build futuristic stuff. His $44 billion acquisition of Twitter was marketed with a visionary framework: Musk would realize Twitter&#39;s dreams of being a truly global town square and solve the intractable problems of free speech at scale. Having failed at that, Musk is, in essence, going back to basics with X—it&#39;s an opportunity to remake the internet in his own image.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-outage-elon-musk-user-restrictions/674609/">Read: Elon Musk really broke Twitter this time</a><br><br> As <em>Bloomberg</em> ’s Max Chafkin <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/chafkin/status/1683475959981264900/photo/2">pointed out</a> , Musk&#39;s original X.com brand was a total failure. He was obsessed with the name and the web address, but consumers, not illogically, associated the brand with adult-entertainment sites. Musk was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/was-elon-musk-fired-from-paypal/">ousted</a> by X.com&#39;s board after the merger in 2000, a year before the service was renamed PayPal, but the payment company remains an important part of his legacy. X, then, is a callback to a younger version of the entrepreneur—one who is associated with success, products that work, and generous investor returns. It also represents unfinished business and a chance to rewrite an earlier phase of his career.<br><br> In this sense, X is less a brilliant vision than it is an act of desperation. Musk is behaving much like a start-up with an unsustainable burn rate—he needs a cash injection. And in order to raise some reputational capital, he needs a good idea, one that seems plausible and scalable. X checks all the boxes for such an idea. Its ambitions are so vague as to be boundless, which signals perpetual growth and moneymaking—it is, quite literally, the <em>everything</em> app. In this way, X is an inkblot test for anyone who still wants to believe in Musk: Squint the right way and X takes on the form of whatever hopes and dreams that person has for the future of the internet. This is the fleeting genius of pseudoware: The best feature of marketing an app for everything is that you can get away with saying mostly nothing.<br><br> But just how many people still have unwavering faith in Musk is an open question. How many people are willing to give the benefit of the doubt to the man who can&#39;t pay his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbctv18.com/technology/twitter-evicted-boulder-office-colorado-unpaid-rent-elon-musk-16949921.htm#:~:text=The%20company%20failed%20to%20pay,to%20non%2Dpayment%20of%20rent.">rents</a> and server <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.platformer.news/p/twitter-stiffs-google">bills</a> on time? Who is going to help build this technological behemoth for the man who fired the majority of his company and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/jul/12/twitter-severance-payments-lawsuit">allegedly</a> owes $500 million in severance payments? And, perhaps most important, who is excited about what Musk is focusing his time, energy, and money on?<br><br> Even though X wants to be big, a WeChat clone is conceptually small in comparison with the projects that have allowed Musk to market himself as a savant: space exploration, rewiring the human brain, revolutionizing transportation to save the Earth. The most cynical view of X is that the people who still respect Musk are reactionaries who delight only when their enemies have been gleefully trolled. Perhaps, then, Musk&#39;s dismantling of the social network is a success, so long as it makes the right people miserable. Left with few options, Musk has decided to mortgage the Twitter brand to save his own. Even by his standards, it&#39;s a risky bet.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 16:56:12 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-musk-x-rebrand/674818/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-musk-x-rebrand/674818/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Controversial Model for America’s Climate Future]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> In much of the South, electricity is in the hands of the US government, not private companies.

The three stout towers, each 435 feet high, buckled at the waist in synchrony, then crumpled like crushed soda cans. Within 10 seconds, they&#39;d collapsed into a billowing cloud of dust.<br><br> To anyone who watched the demolition happen, or saw the footage online, the message was clear: TVA, a sprawling, federally owned utility created 90 years ago as part of President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s New Deal, is getting off coal.<br><br> Though some people in the region regret that move, it&#39;s a win for the local environment—and for the global climate. In the past few years, as the urgency of slowing climate change has grown, something like a consensus has emerged on how to do it: Green the electrical grid while retooling as much of the economy as possible—cars, buildings, factories—to run on zero-carbon electricity. The Inflation Reduction Act, signed by President Joe Biden last August, is supporting that plan with $370 billion in subsidies. In a 2021 executive order, Biden directed the federal government to “lead by example in order to achieve a carbon pollution–free electricity sector by 2035” and a net-zero economy by 2050.<br><br> Given this strategy, electric utilities are crucial to our future—and none more so than TVA, the largest public power provider in the United States. Its territory covers nearly all of Tennessee; large chunks of Alabama, Mississippi, and Kentucky; and bits of three other states. In one of the most conservative regions of the country, 10 million people get electricity from a federal agency that has no shareholders to answer to and no profits to make.<br><br> “TVA is this crazy unicorn—it&#39;s not like anything else,” Stephen Smith, the executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, told me. As a federal agency responsible not just for promoting the clean-energy transition but for building it, TVA is positioned to provide a national model—and TVA says it is doing just that.<br><br> But that&#39;s not how Smith and other environmental advocates describe TVA&#39;s behavior. They see a utility that is replacing coal plants, at Paradise and elsewhere, with gas-burning plants that will pollute the climate for decades. They see a utility betting heavily on small nuclear reactors that don&#39;t yet exist. Above all, they say, TVA is failing to embrace proven clean-energy technologies, such as solar and wind power and energy-efficiency measures.<br><br> “TVA is a living laboratory that could be part of a phenomenal push to change to clean energy,” Smith said. Instead of an agency “on a war footing to get us to zero carbon,” he sees it becoming “an impediment in the executive branch.”<br><br> TVA has cut its carbon emissions by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tva.com/environment/environmental-stewardship/sustainability/carbon-report">well over half since 2005</a> , far more than the nationwide average for the electricity sector, while charging lower-than-average rates. It has done so by replacing coal with gas and by switching on a large new nuclear reactor. But like most American utilities, TVA has no plans to reach Biden&#39;s goal of a net-zero grid by 2035; it&#39;s targeting only an 80 percent carbon reduction by that date. “We aspire to net-zero by 2050, and we aspire to go farther, faster, if we can,” Jeff Lyash, TVA&#39;s president and CEO since 2019, said at a meeting of the agency&#39;s board of directors in November. With existing technology, though, he doesn&#39;t think that&#39;s possible.<br><br> What&#39;s the right road to net-zero? The Tennessee Valley is an illuminating microcosm of a national debate, in which the imperative of addressing climate change is pitted against the enormous practical challenge of not only maintaining a reliable electric supply but dramatically expanding it to meet the needs of a decarbonizing economy. “TVA is in a unique position to lead in delivering the clean-energy future,” Lyash said in November. He and his critics agree on that much. But as for when that future will arrive, and what it will look like, they are very far apart indeed.<br><br>时间<br><br><span class="smallcaps">VA was born</span> from another global crisis. In 1933, when Roosevelt and Senator George Norris, a Nebraska Republican, persuaded Congress to establish TVA, the United States was at the nadir of the Great Depression, and the Tennessee Valley, where only a tiny percentage of the homes had electricity, was one of the country&#39;s poorest regions. TVA transformed it. Starting with the Wilson Dam, at Muscle Shoals, Alabama, a series of dams controlled flooding on the Tennessee River and its tributaries and electrified the whole Valley. Hydroelectric plants still produce about 10 percent of the region&#39;s power, carbon-free.<br><br> Private utilities hated TVA, and complained bitterly about what they saw as unfair competition. They challenged the agency&#39;s existence before the Supreme Court and lost, twice. As late as the 1950s, President Dwight Eisenhower wanted to sell off the agency, which he saw as an example of “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1953/06/18/archives/eisenhower-points-to-the-t-v-a-as-creeping-socialism-example.html">creeping socialism</a> .” The agency survived by becoming quasi-independent of the federal government. The president appoints and Congress confirms TVA&#39;s board, but since 1959, TVA has mostly done without federal appropriations. It pays its own way by selling electricity—not directly to consumers (aside from a few dozen industrial and federal properties), but to the 153 municipally or cooperatively owned local power companies, or LPCs, that distribute power to the people.<br><br> From the start, TVA&#39;s strategy was to make electricity cheap and accessible enough that people would use it for everything. The agency succeeded so well that demand soon outstripped what even a thoroughly dammed river could supply. In the &#39;50s, TVA began relying on coal as its main energy source, ultimately building 12 large power plants. Over the past decade, it has closed six, but giant piles of toxic ash remain. In 2008, a dike ruptured at the coal plant in Kingston, Tennessee, spilling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/coal-other-dark-side-toxic-ash?loggedin=true&amp;rnd=1676993465551">more than 5 million cubic yards of ash</a> into the Emory and Clinch Rivers.<br><br> Environmentalists have long had reason to distrust TVA. In the &#39;70s, when the newly created Environmental Protection Agency began regulating air pollution, TVA resisted. Accustomed to making its own engineering decisions, it argued that investing in scrubbers for its coal stacks made no sense—after all, it was about to replace most of them with nuclear reactors. But the agency completed only seven of a planned 17 reactors—demand for electricity grew slower than forecast—and today, unfinished reactor hulks lie scattered around the Valley. The fiasco left TVA constrained by debt, which still totals nearly $20 billion.<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1962/04/the-rape-of-the-appalachians/658469/">From the April 1962 issue: Harry Caudill on TVA and the destruction of the Appalachian Mountains</a><br><br> Nevertheless, TVA is proud of its nuclear fleet. Although Georgia Power is expected to bring a new reactor online soon, TVA has been the only US utility to have managed that in the past three decades. It began construction on the two reactors at its Watts Bar plant, in Tennessee, in 1973; mothballed them for years; then completed them in 1996 and 2016. In the first half of 2023, they and the agency&#39;s other reactors helped it generate nearly 60 percent of its kilowatt-hours without emitting carbon—significantly higher than the national average. But it has “fumbled, failed, and flopped” into that enviable position, Stephen Smith told me. The climate crisis demands transformative change, Smith said, and TVA has abandoned its historic mission to provide precisely that.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n downtown Chattanooga</span> , the people directly responsible for delivering electricity to the Valley&#39;s 10 million residents sit in TVA&#39;s system-operations center. It&#39;s a large, hushed, dimly lit room, in which curving rows of workstations face a wall filled with an illuminated schematic of TVA&#39;s sprawling transmission grid. The first rows of operators track the physical condition and voltage of the transmission lines. The operators behind them “dispatch” power as needed from hundreds of generators around the grid, matching supply to demand minute by minute. That complex job is simplified by having lots of “dispatchable” power, which is what coal, gas, nuclear, and hydro plants provide, at least in principle: power that&#39;s available any time of the day or year.<br><br> In a conference room overlooking the control room, I met Greg Henrich and Aaron Melda, TVA&#39;s vice president and senior vice president for transmission and power supply. Melda had helped formulate the agency&#39;s decarbonization strategy, and he grabbed a marker to sketch out the numbers on a flip chart. The strategy&#39;s central element is the closure of TVA&#39;s last five coal plants, all more than 50 years old, by 2035. “Over the same period, we will add 10,000 megawatts of solar,” Melda said. To store energy for when the sun isn&#39;t shining, TVA will also add 1,000 megawatts of battery capacity.<br><br> Over the next decade, though, the agency&#39;s main carbon-reduction strategy is to build more gas plants—7,000 megawatts&#39; worth, roughly the capacity of the current coal fleet. When I visited the system-ops center last fall, TVA was finalizing plans for the latest addition: a 1,450-megawatt gas plant in Cumberland City, Tennessee, at the site of its biggest coal plant, whose two generating units are scheduled to retire in 2026 and 2028. Environmentalists strenuously opposed the gas plant—even the EPA questioned it—arguing that it would commit TVA to emitting carbon long past 2035 or even 2050. In the near term, though, the switch from coal will substantially reduce emissions of carbon and other pollutants. “You replace coal with gas, you&#39;ve now taken every one of those megawatts down 50 percent in its carbon intensity,” Melda said.<br><br> Why not just build more batteries and more solar, and take the intensity down to zero? It would cost a lot more, Melda said, and batteries discharge within several hours. A few rainy days could leave you unable to meet demand. Nor is solar a big help on dark winter mornings, which are the moments that TVA worries about most. The majority of homes in the Valley have electric heat. A spokesperson for TVA, Scott Fiedler, later said that gas is “the only mature technology that allows us to quickly add renewable energy and maintain the low cost and reliability” needed.<br><br> I visited the system-ops center on a chilly November day a week before Thanksgiving. Early that morning, as people cranked up their thermostat, TVA had seen a fairly typical winter peak in the load on its grid. Warmer weather was coming that would drive down demand, Henrich said, but it would rise again on Thanksgiving morning, as people roasted turkeys. That afternoon, the load would plummet. “Everybody&#39;s asleep on the couch,” Henrich said. “It&#39;s awesome to watch—it&#39;s truly societal behavior driving your load.”<br><br> He opened the blinds on the conference-room windows so we could see into the control room itself. It looked pretty quiet, with a lot of the workstations empty. “When does it ever get exciting?”我问。 A month later, my question was answered.<br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">n December 23</span> , people in the Tennessee Valley awoke to temperatures that had <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.knoxnews.com/story/news/local/tennessee/2023/01/19/tva-blackouts-winter-storm-cold-aging-power-plants/69777671007/">plunged 40 degrees or more overnight</a> . Worse, both units of the Cumberland coal plant had shut down, because thick ice from a big storm had encased instruments on the exposed boilers. In the morning, the Bull Run coal plant wouldn&#39;t start, and some natural-gas plants failed too. As demand soared to an all-time winter record of 33,427 megawatts, the operators in Chattanooga found themselves about 8,000 megawatts short. Neighboring utilities couldn&#39;t help; the storm had affected half the country.<br><br> For two hours that morning, TVA had to instruct its 153 local power companies to cut demand by 5 percent. On Christmas Eve, it asked for a 10 percent cut for more than five hours. To comply, the LPCs shut off power neighborhood by neighborhood for 15 minutes or more at a time. The rolling blackouts were the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2023/jan/31/tva-looking-into-ways-to-avoid-future-outages-tfp/">first in TVA&#39;s 90-year history</a> . At Christmas dinner, Fiedler told me, his mother required him to explain why his storied organization had cut her power on the holiday. “She wore me out,” he said.<br><br> TVA likes to boast of its reliability, and environmental advocates seized on the Christmas failure. “The emperor has no clothes,” Amanda Garcia, the director of the Southern Environmental Law Center&#39;s Tennessee office, told me. “The winter storm to me provided a perfect example of why TVA needs to change”—by showing that fossil fuels are no guarantee of reliability and that it should be transitioning to renewables faster. The Sierra Club ranks TVA among the very worst American utilities for its energy transition. The Center for Biological Diversity calls it a “climate laggard.” Both want the agency to replace all its coal plants as soon as possible with renewable energy, not gas.<br><br> A modeling study released in March by the Center for Biological Diversity and by GridLab, a nonprofit consulting group, concluded that TVA could indeed stop burning both coal and gas by 2035. To do that, it would need to build the equivalent of about 145 large solar farms, with a total capacity of 35 gigawatts, in its territory, along with the transmission lines needed to import about 12 gigawatts of wind power from the Midwest. (The Valley isn&#39;t windy enough to produce cost-effective wind power.) Then, by 2050, it would have to nearly triple that expansion again in order to electrify and decarbonize the Valley&#39;s economy. The goals are ambitious, given the delays that now plague many renewable and transmission projects—but the benefits to society would dwarf the costs, the study found. Consumers would save more than $250 billion, mostly from switching to cars that run on TVA&#39;s electricity rather than gasoline. Carbon emissions would drop by hundreds of millions of tons.<br><br> The first step toward a clean-energy future, advocates agree, would be to reduce energy waste in the Valley. About a quarter of homes there rely on resistance heating—the method employed in electric furnaces and space heaters. Many heat pumps also fall back on it at freezing temperatures, Huntsville Utilities&#39; president and CEO, Wes Kelley, told me. “That is basically the equivalent of turning on a bunch of big hair dryers to heat your house,” Kelley said.<br><br> According to National Renewable Energy Laboratory <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://resstock.nrel.gov/factsheets/TN">estimates</a> , efficiency measures, including more and better heat pumps, could save roughly as much electricity as the Cumberland gas plant will generate. “If you reduce that resistance heating, you&#39;re helping the system as a whole”—by reducing the peak load—“as well as the customer,” Maggie Shober, the research director at the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE), told me. Because people in the Valley use so much electricity, monthly bills are high even though rates are low, creating an especially heavy burden on the poor.<br><br> Utilities generally have little incentive to invest in energy-saving measures, which only reduce their revenue. But TVA should be different: It doesn&#39;t need to make a profit. Since 2018, it has run an admirable program, called Home Uplift, that provides heat pumps, weatherization, and other measures to low-income homeowners, all for free—but so far, only to 5,000 of the hundreds of thousands of Valley residents who might be eligible. TVA could do much more, SACE and other critics say, especially now that the Inflation Reduction Act is subsidizing energy-efficiency programs. For its part, TVA says it&#39;s planning more of these types of investments, including rebates to replace older and less efficient heat pumps. Fiedler, the TVA spokesperson, said the agency will lower energy costs in underserved communities by $200 million over the next five years through Home Uplift and other programs.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he environmental advocates</span> I talked with were all suspicious of TVA&#39;s clean-energy intentions. SACE&#39;s Stephen Smith, a close observer of the agency for more than three decades, thinks TVA is building gas plants now and planning nuclear for the future because large power plants are what it is comfortable building, and it has a monopoly on building them in the Valley. The future of the industry should lie in “shifting from central stations to a more distributed model that opens up a whole new powerful toolbox for fixing the climate crisis,” Smith said. “But TVA is not going there.”<br><br> He and other advocates see a “rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a liveable and sustainable future,” to quote the most recent United Nations climate report, and in that stark light, TVA&#39;s current fleet of renewables looks inadequate, especially if you set aside the hydroelectric dams and focus on what it has achieved lately. It buys about 1,200 megawatts of wind from the Midwest; it has installed about 1,000 megawatts of solar capacity in the Valley. That&#39;s far less solar power, Amanda Garcia pointed out, than deployed by utilities in the Carolinas or Georgia. Though she acknowledged TVA&#39;s plans to expand solar over the coming decade, “actions speak louder than words,” she said.<br><br> But TVA is actually making a big effort these days, Gil Hough, the executive director of TenneSEIA, the state solar-industry association, told me. Hough worked for SACE from 2000 to 2010, promoting solar with Smith. Now he helps deliver it to TVA.<br><br> In the mid-2010s, he told me, the agency did indeed walk away from solar because it was focused on paying down its nuclear debt. Under Lyash, though, TVA has changed, Hough said. It may have only 1,000 megawatts of solar online—but it has more than 2,200 under construction or contracted. “TVA wants every megawatt we can provide them right now,” Hough said. “It&#39;s <i>us</i> who&#39;s holding <i>them</i> back.” Supply-chain disruptions have slowed solar projects and raised prices. But Lyash announced in May that TVA would award contracts this year for 6,000 megawatts of solar power, to be brought online between 2026 and 2029. “We are building as much solar as we can get panels for,” he said.<br><br> What got TVA&#39;s attention was the demand from large corporations, says Reagan Farr, the CEO of the Nashville-based Silicon Ranch, which owns and operates solar farms for TVA and other utilities. Farr told me that companies like Google and Meta, by insisting on renewable energy, convinced TVA that it could no longer fulfill its mission of economic development without expanding its solar capacity. “The power of these large companies—their procurement decisions drive actions,” Farr said.<br><br> Local resistance to solar farms is a growing problem, both TVA and the industry say. At the November TVA board meeting, Chief Operating Officer Don Moul <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/environment/2022/11/10/tva-memphis-coal-ash-to-build-solar-farm/69637542007/">announced a $216 million plan to build a 100-megawatt solar plant on top of the coal-ash pile at the Shawnee power plant</a> , in Kentucky. If it works, Moul said, as much as 1,000 megawatts of solar might one day rise from ash piles around the region—poetic justice, and a way to “alleviate some of the land challenges that we&#39;ve heard about from so many of our stakeholders,” Moul said.<br><br> One of TVA&#39;s key constituencies are the local power companies that distribute its electricity. Their perspective is often very different from that of environmental advocates. At a listening session before a February 2023 board meeting in Muscle Shoals, a dozen of their representatives got up to speak—not about renewables or climate change, but about the blackouts. They were a “black eye for all of us in the Valley,” said Brian Solsbee, the executive director of the Tennessee Municipal Electric Power Association and a former TVA employee. “How does TVA ensure it never happens again?” It needs new generation capacity, Huntsville Utilities&#39; Wes Kelley told me.<br><br> When it was Lyash&#39;s turn to speak, he said what he has said repeatedly: that TVA plans to use all available technologies to decarbonize. He promised a renewed focus on energy efficiency and an aggressive expansion of solar—but also of gas and, in the long run, nuclear. “Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket,” he said. Renewables, in his view, are one basket.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he Tennessee Valley</span> is going through a period of economic expansion that would make Roosevelt proud, and TVA, with its reputation for cheap and reliable power, is partly responsible. The Valley&#39;s new growth includes electric-vehicle, battery, and solar-panel manufacturers—the industries that will drive the electrification of America. When I first met Lyash in Chattanooga, where he had just presented TVA&#39;s Engineer of the Year award, he rattled off some of the names. “Ford, GM, Toyota, Mazda, Volkswagen, LG, SK—those industries are going to decarbonize transportation,” he said. “So we have to provide them the energy <i>now</i> .” Demand is growing already, and Lyash expects it potentially to double by 2050. A study last year by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), which mapped how the grid might be decarbonized by 2035, in line with Biden&#39;s goal, assumed that demand might even double by then.<br><br> The decision to build a new gas plant at Cumberland comes in that context as well as that of climate urgency. In TVA&#39;s view, even if it could build enough additional renewables and transmission lines to replace the Cumberland coal unit it plans to retire by 2026, which it says it can&#39;t, solar and wind wouldn&#39;t offer “firm, dispatchable power”—power that&#39;s available regardless of weather or time of day. The basic problem, as the NREL report explains, is “seasonal mismatch”: There&#39;s not enough sunlight to meet peak demand on cold winter mornings and not enough wind on hot summer afternoons; both can be minimal for days.<br><br> Given this reality, is it reasonable to build a new gas plant today, even though it will emit some carbon for years to come? I put the question to Paul Denholm, a senior research fellow at NREL and the lead author of the recent study. “That is a fantastic question, and it&#39;s something everybody is trying to figure out,” he said.<br><br> All visions of a decarbonized grid and of an electrified, net-zero society require huge expansions of wind and solar power. But the NREL study foresees that a net-zero grid will also need some kind of gas to meet peak demand. In three of its four net-zero scenarios, turbines are still burning substantial amounts of natural gas in 2035, and the carbon is being captured rather than released into the atmosphere. In all scenarios, many gas turbines are retrofitted to burn zero-carbon hydrogen.<br><br> TVA&#39;s vision of the future, as Lyash and Aaron Melda explained it to me, aligns broadly with the NREL study. Any gas plants that TVA builds now, they said, will one day either burn “green hydrogen” or involve carbon capture—neither is in wide use yet, and TVA is investing in both. The reason TVA won&#39;t promise a net-zero grid by 2035, Lyash said, is because “it&#39;s going to take deploying technologies that are not currently available at a price people can afford and a scale that can be implemented.” The NREL study assumes that those technologies will be developed in time to reach net zero by 2035; TVA doesn&#39;t want to count on that.<br><br> It&#39;s no surprise, Denholm said, that utilities are struggling to figure out how to cut the last 10 to 20 percent of their carbon emissions. NREL researchers haven&#39;t figured it out either. “The fact that you have conservative utilities saying they know how to [cut] 80 percent—that is a really remarkable shift,” he told me. “I think we need to recognize that and applaud it.”<br><br> Another influential report, Princeton&#39;s 2021 “Net-Zero America” study, included a scenario in which <i>only</i> renewable energy was allowed: By 2050, wind turbines were visible from about one-eighth of the area of the Lower 48 states, solar farms covered an area the size of West Virginia, and long-distance transmission lines mushroomed to five times their existing capacity. Even when such facilities share land with other uses—Silicon Ranch, for instance, allows sheep to graze or pollinator gardens to bloom among the solar panels—they are a significant industrial intrusion on the landscape.<br><br> In some regions, people may prefer less of those—and more of the compact central power stations that TVA knows how to build. The NREL and Princeton studies both include net-zero scenarios in which the expansion of renewable facilities and transmission lines is constrained, perhaps by “challenges with siting and land use,” as NREL puts it. Both scenarios rely, as does TVA, on nuclear plants. “I can&#39;t make the numbers work without new nuclear,” Lyash told me.<br><br> Like many nuclear engineers these days, he thinks the future lies in small modular reactors, or SMRs. At a site on the Clinch River, TVA is planning the first of what it hopes will be a fleet of 20 or so identical SMRs, using a relatively conventional design. “Our goal is not just to build a plant, but to build a plant that sets the model for the US industry,” Greg Boerschig, one of the engineers running the TVA effort, told me.<br><br> The way environmentalists focus on TVA&#39;s renewable capacity or lack thereof frustrates Lyash. “The point is,” he said, “what are your carbon emissions, and what&#39;s your price, and what&#39;s your reliability?” Different regions with different starting points—Arizona has a lot of sunshine, Oklahoma has wind, TVA has a legacy of nuclear and hydro—might reach their clean-energy goals in different ways.<br><br> Toward the end of our last conversation, Lyash opened an app on his phone that shows real-time carbon emissions from electricity generation. “One of the countries that gets held up as having deployed huge amounts of solar, and it&#39;s a big percentage of their capacity, is Germany,” he said. “Germany&#39;s carbon emissions right now are 426 grams per unit of electricity. And today, right now, TVA&#39;s is 247 … And our price is less than a third of theirs.”<br><br> That happened to be a bad day for Germany&#39;s numbers and a good one for TVA&#39;s—but long-term data confirm Lyash&#39;s point: Germany gets a far higher percentage of its electricity from renewables than TVA, but emits substantially more carbon per kilowatt-hour. Germany has made different choices. It closed its last nuclear reactor in April.<br><br> E <span class="smallcaps">nvironmentalists are right</span> to be wary of TVA. In the past it has performed badly on a variety of environmental issues. It built an unnecessary dam, the Tellico, that drowned important Cherokee cultural sites and hundreds of farms and notoriously threatened to extinguish a little fish, the snail darter. (The darter has since recovered.) It stepped back from solar and energy-efficiency efforts when it could have led the way. It was slow to reduce air pollution from its coal plants—which are still lethal polluters—and allowed the major coal-ash disaster in Kingston to happen. This May, even as Lyash was promising 6,000 megawatts of new renewable energy, TVA doubled down on its Cumberland decision: It released a draft environmental-impact statement saying that it also wanted to replace the Kingston plant with gas power by the end of 2027. That will lock in higher emissions for longer, environmentalists say.<br><br> Garcia and Smith think TVA lacks public accountability. They point out that it has no independent public-service commission to regulate it, only a board that, like corporate boards, has no staff of its own and thus depends on management. They would like to loosen TVA&#39;s monopoly and free local power companies to buy power elsewhere, bridling the “unicorn” with market discipline.<br><br> But that would risk undermining the very thing that makes the agency such a precious unicorn: the public-power model. TVA has retained political support, at least in its sphere, for an active government role in improving people&#39;s lives. And in a region where environmental causes are hardly unifying, TVA has said, publicly and repeatedly, that it wants to stop emitting carbon as fast as it can. How it does that should be debated—but in many conversations with TVA and its critics, I never heard a solid reason to doubt its good faith.<br><br> As I traveled the Tennessee Valley, I visited monuments from TVA&#39;s golden age, including Wilson Dam, in northwestern Alabama, with its lofty, sunlit turbine hall and arches like a Roman aqueduct&#39;s, and Norris Dam, in northeastern Tennessee, which closes off the narrow Clinch River with a tall, sculptural curve. TVA engineers and the people of this region built these marvels “for generations yet unborn,” as Senator George Norris liked to say,  with no notion of how valuable they would become in an age of climate change.<br><br> Now it&#39;s time to build more.<br><br> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article is part of the</i> Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">Planet series supported by the HHMI Department of Science Education.</i></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 16:44:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tennessee-valley-authority-energy-transition-nuclear/674729/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/tennessee-valley-authority-energy-transition-nuclear/674729/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Two Players Who Tell the Story of U.S. Women’s Soccer]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Megan Rapinoe represents the national team&#39;s legacy; Alyssa Thompson, its future. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/89pjUd2MTqnOxtJ8tu8OcqdGuUE=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/womens_soccer/original.jpg" alt="Alyssa Thompson substituting in with Megan Rapinoe in a soccer match" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Brad Smith / Getty</figcaption></figure> I <span class="smallcaps">n 2019, I stood in a bar in Atlanta, Georgia,</span> surrounded by hundreds of other people adorned in red, blue, and white. It was the semifinals of the Women&#39;s World Cup, and the United States was playing against England. The US women were looking to go on to the final, but this would be no easy feat.<br><br> The game moved back and forth: The US scored in the first 10 minutes of the match, and the English scored about 10 minutes later. Then, 31 minutes in, the US captain, Alex Morgan, cut across an English defender and headed in the game-winning goal. She celebrated by pretending to sip a cup of tea. The Atlanta bar went wild, perhaps just as much for the trolling celebration as for the goal. A friend of mine, who spends far more of his time watching the NFL and NBA than women&#39;s soccer, turned to me and said, “This is the most fun I&#39;ve ever had watching sports in my life!”<br><br> The US would go on to defeat the Netherlands in the final to win its fourth World Cup. But the 2019 tournament was also a special turning point for women&#39;s soccer in America. It&#39;s clear, looking back, that the emotional investment of so many American fans was tied not only to the team&#39;s accomplishments on the field, but also to the national and sporting politics of the moment. For many, Megan Rapinoe, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/06/megan-rapinoe-new-muhammad-ali/592867/">the star of that World Cup</a> who continuously spoke out against homophobia, racism, and sexism, became a symbolic counterweight to the Trump administration. Watching the top women&#39;s soccer player in the world (Rapinoe would officially win the Best FIFA Women&#39;s Player award a few months later) adorned in the colors and crest of the United States provided many fans with a sense of pride in their country after years of political tumult. The success of the women&#39;s team also coincided with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/womens-world-cup-final-boon-equal-pay/593419/">their legal fight to be paid equally</a> to the men&#39;s team. Throughout the tournament, many people got the sense that cheering for the national team also meant rooting for the effort to close the gap between men and women in other areas of American life.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-soccer/674802/">Read: The Women&#39;s World Cup is about more than soccer</a><br><br> If the 2019 women&#39;s team represented a soccer culture in flux, this year&#39;s squad speaks to something else: how the women&#39;s game in the United States has never been more stable than it is today.<br><br> Rapinoe, now 38 and playing in her fourth World Cup, has announced that this will be her last tournament and that she will retire from professional soccer at the end of her domestic season. Rapinoe is the squad&#39;s oldest player, and her journey has been long. After she left the University of Portland, she decided to go professional in 2009. She became the second overall pick of the inaugural Women&#39;s Professional Soccer league at a time when the average salary of a professional women&#39;s player in the US was roughly $25,000. Just a year later, her team folded, and only two years after <em>that</em> , the entire league suspended operations. Rapinoe then played in Australia and France, and even in an amateur league, before joining the newly formed National Women&#39;s Soccer League in the US in 2013. She has played for OL Reign (formerly the Seattle Reign FC) ever since.<br><br> Now consider Rapinoe&#39;s teammate, Alyssa Thompson. She is 18 years old, currently in her first season in the NWSL, and, as of Friday&#39;s 3–0 win against Vietnam, the second-youngest player ever to represent the country in a World Cup.<br><br> The gap between the experience of the youngest and oldest members of the team tells the story of women&#39;s soccer in the United States. The NWSL is now in its 11th season. The league and the players have their <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/nwsl-players-make-history-with-first-ever-collective-bargaining-agreement-ahead-of-2022-preseason/">first-ever collective-bargaining agreement</a> , which includes an increase in player salaries, free housing, health insurance, 401(k)s, and formal parental leave. (The new agreement also put in place new protocols for player safety, something that took on an additional, urgent importance following a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/10/03/1126587851/womens-soccer-abuse-nwsl-report">2022 report</a> that found that emotional abuse and sexual misconduct were a systemic issue in the league.) More than 1 million fans attended NWSL matches last season. And this season, the average attendance on the opening night beat the league&#39;s previous attendance record <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://frontofficesports.com/nwsl-crushes-attendance-record-with-media-deal-looming/">by nearly 50 percent</a> .<br><br> Thompson&#39;s team, Angel City FC, based in Los Angeles, represents an unprecedented level of success and optimism for women&#39;s professional soccer. The team is owned by a conglomerate of high-profile celebrities including Natalie Portman, America Ferrera, Eva Longoria, and Serena Williams, as well as former soccer greats such as Mia Hamm, Abby Wambach, Julie Foudy, and Shannon Boxx. Their games have been attended by Hollywood stars and have an average home attendance of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://soccerstadiumdigest.com/2023-nwsl-attendance/">nearly 20,000 people</a> a game this season, which is higher than the average of more than a dozen Major League Soccer men&#39;s teams. HBO produced a three-part documentary about the team this past May. As of last year, the team reportedly has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sports.yahoo.com/nwsl-valuations-soar-angel-city-040100393.html?amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAALTYTIYrACmWnVGMYi1mMRxgVkwRudQ7WFCdBV_3zOI_dEIFbys4os-LiD98ojy1fQ9DyG0NRMsPkCfkSRqkWS4bJI0nWiEhES1x_BWWGA4bFGYtpN3iuN7SW4pgip8kvJ7FcBqYi-1naZqiJ2wePhRDApj2b5goC6bOHzfzWQVG&amp;guccounter=2">a valuation of $100 million</a> , twice as much as any other team in the league.<br><br> Though she is just in her first professional season, Thompson is quickly becoming the face of the franchise. Michael Holzer has been the private coach of Thompson and her sister Gisele (a year younger and a member of the US Women&#39;s Youth National Team) for the past two and a half years. He told me that Thompson was born with a natural gift for soccer but has also competed against boys and older women since she was about 13 years old. Of both sisters, he said, “I would often put them with adult college players or adult pro players to really test and challenge them.” Holzer also said that many of his sessions with the sisters would begin at 5:30 am, before school started, and that the two have pushed each other to a higher level. “They&#39;re so disciplined. That&#39;s what separates them, beyond their talent,” he said. He added something else that differentiates Thompson: “She is also incredibly fast.” (Even that might be an understatement. Thompson ran the 100-meter dash her junior year of high school in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/a44292226/alyssa-thompson-us-womens-national-team/">11.69 seconds</a> , one of the fastest times in the state, despite making track practice only periodically because of soccer.)<br><br> Thompson hadn&#39;t originally intended to go pro this early. She had committed to Stanford, a longtime powerhouse in women&#39;s soccer that has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.soccerwire.com/soccer-blog/stanford-world-cup-legacy/">served as an incubator</a> for future national-team players. But Holzer said that plans changed for Thompson following her national-team debut last year. In October 2022, when she was still in her senior year of high school, she made her first appearance for the US Women&#39;s National Team (USWNT), subbing in for the player she had long admired, Rapinoe. “I think that experience showed her and her family that she&#39;s ready,” Holzer told me. Angel City thought she was ready too, and spent nearly half a million dollars to ensure their selection of Thompson as the first overall pick in the 2023 NWSL draft this January.<br><br> Thompson has already shown why Angel City made such a big bet on her. Eleven minutes into her NWSL debut this past March, she received a pass from her teammate on the left side of the field, dropped her shoulder, let the ball run across the front of her body, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UULuwgn6mw4">fired a shot from about 20 yards out</a> into the top right-hand corner of the net. She became the second-youngest player in the league to score in a debut, and the fourth youngest to score any NWSL goal. She was still two months away from her high-school graduation. A couple of months later, she became the first teenager to make a USWNT roster since 1995.<br><br> Still, it is difficult to overstate the amount of groundwork that has been laid for players like Thompson by the athletes who came before them. When Thompson was growing up, many women who played professional soccer had to take on other jobs, most teams struggled to have even a few thousand people show up to games, and little protected the players from exploitation and abuse. The NWSL is still growing, and more can be done to support its athletes, but the landscape of US women&#39;s soccer today is radically different from Rapinoe&#39;s early days. Thompson is acutely aware of this. “I feel like I was born at the right time, because the women&#39;s game is growing so much right now,” she said in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IBy_oCaKQKg"><em>Players&#39; Tribune</em> interview</a> alongside her Angel City teammate Christen Press, a veteran of the USWNT and winner of two World Cups. Referring to Press, she said, “All the players like you and past national-team players made it to where it is now, and it&#39;s honestly amazing, because this would not be an option” before. In particular, she talked about her amazement at substituting for Rapinoe in her debut: “I could not stop thinking about going in, like, <em>I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m here</em> .”<br><br> Thompson isn&#39;t the only one here—a whole new generation of young women are at this year&#39;s World Cup. There&#39;s 21-year-old Trinity Rodman, who has reportedly signed the most lucrative contract in NWSL history, and there&#39;s 22-year-old Sophia Smith, the reigning US Women&#39;s Player of the Year, who scored twice in the opening game against Vietnam. These women, and others, represent the present and future of the US national team. It is a legacy they intend to protect.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 16:29:24 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-2023-nwsl-megan-rapinoe-alyssa-thompson/674816/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-2023-nwsl-megan-rapinoe-alyssa-thompson/674816/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[A New Kind of Fascism]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> I&#39;ve resisted using the word until now, but something menacing and novel is taking shape with the possibility of a second Trump term. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/YUXcFiauXpQZv1KuRzhYZNE0DR4=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/trump/original.jpg" alt="特朗普在连任竞选中" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Damon Winter / The New York Times / Redux</figcaption></figure> For some years, a variety of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.salon.com/tv/video/vuli6z">news commentators</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/1/29/22250294/trump-american-fascism-jason-stanley">academics</a> have called Donald Trump a fascist. I was one of those who resisted using that term. I thought it had long been abused by casual, imprecise applications, and as a historian of Nazi Germany, I did not think Trumpism was anywhere close to crossing the threshold of that comparison. I still deny that Trump&#39;s presidency was <i>fascist</i> ; but I&#39;m concerned that if he wins another trip to the White House, he could earn the label.<br><br> Fascism was most fully exemplified by the regimes of Benito Mussolini and Adolf Hitler. These regimes combined totalitarian dictatorship, wars of imperial conquest, and outright genocide in the case of Hitler (of Jews, Slavs, Roma) or ethnic mass murder in Mussolini&#39;s case (of Libyans, Ethiopians, Slovenes). Placing Trumpism in the same category seemed to me trivializing and misleading.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/10/25/suffocation-of-democracy/">I argued instead that</a> Trump was more like Hungary&#39;s Viktor Orbán or Turkey&#39;s Recep Tayyip Erdoğan than Hitler or Mussolini, and should be categorized as an “illiberal populist” rather than a fascist. And in one very important respect, Trump differed sharply from the European fascists of the interwar period.<br><br> They were ardent militarists and imperialists. War was the crucible in which the new fascist man was to be forged; territorial expansion was both the means and the end of fascist power and triumph. Trump has shown little ambition to pursue such aims. In his first term, he shamelessly abased himself before Russian President Vladimir Putin, exchanged <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/10/19/how-trumps-love-letters-with-kim-jong-un-could-cost-him/">“love letters”</a> with North Korea&#39;s Kim Jong Un, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/08/20/trump-peace-deal-taliban/">signed the Doha Agreement</a> with the Taliban committing the US to withdrawal from Afghanistan, and petulantly sought to downgrade US treaty obligations to NATO and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trump-shakedowns-are-threatening-two-key-u-s-alliances-in-asia/">South Korean</a> allies that he deemed to be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-hits-germany-and-other-delinquent-nato-countries-for-lack-of-defense-spending">“delinquent”</a> and getting a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/03/30/trumps-claim-that-the-u-s-pays-the-lions-share-for-nato/">“free ride.”</a><br><br> Trump has continued in the same isolationist vein in recent interviews and speeches. He has railed against “globalists.” He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/2023/05/11/trump-tells-cnn-town-hall-i-want-everyone-to-stop-dying-in-ukraine/">has promised</a> to settle the Russian-Ukrainian conflict in 24 hours by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.yahoo.com/trump-claims-could-zelensky-putin-225254398.html">cutting off aid</a> to Kyiv if President Volodymyr Zelensky does not reach an immediate settlement with Moscow—that is, capitulate to Putin. He <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4947134">has disparaged</a> Taiwan as a predator nation that stole microchip manufacturing from the US (That Chinese President Xi Jinping would construe the simultaneous abandonment of Ukraine and dismissal of Taiwan as anything other than a green light to invade the latter seems improbable.)<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/nazi-germany-hitler-democracy-weimar/671605/">Christopher R. Browning: How Hitler&#39;s enablers undid democracy in Germany</a><br><br> No question, Trump inflicted grave damage on our country&#39;s political culture, stoking toxic polarization and reveling in dishonesty. And Trumpism did exhibit distinct elements of the fascist style of politics: the inflammatory rallies; the incessant mongering of fear, grievance, and victimization; the casual endorsement of violence; the pervasive embrace of conspiracy theories; the performative cruelty; the feral instinct for targeting marginalized and vulnerable minorities; and the cult of personality. But the Trump presidency lacked any warlike, expansionist interest, and that made it decisively unlike 20th-century fascism.<br><br> Thankfully, also, Trump himself was too lazy, inexperienced, and unprepared to set about systematically constructing a true dictatorship. The main focus of the Trump presidency was less plans and programs and more the theatrics of satisfying his constant, insatiable need for attention and adulation. Everything—whether <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/09/07/president-trumps-repeated-claim-greatest-economy-history-our-country/">the state of the economy</a> or the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/donald-trump-shares-chocolate-cake-great-chemistry-china-s-xi-n745931">chocolate cake served</a> to China&#39;s Xi Jinping at Mar-a-Lago—had to be extolled as “the greatest ever.”<br><br> Until the final weeks of Trump&#39;s term, the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/the-seven-broken-guardrails-of-democracy/484829/">guardrails</a> of American democracy seemed to hold firm. The institutions of the federal government remained relatively intact, and civil servants largely secure and uncorrupted. The United States <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://freedomhouse.org/article/new-report-us-democracy-has-declined-significantly-past-decade-reforms-urgently-needed">experienced</a> democratic backsliding but not democratic collapse.<br><br> In a second term, however, a newly emboldened Trump could well attack democracy itself. The MAGA Republican Party of his making has openly explored ways to transform states where they control all branches of government. States that were once pluralistic democracies with at least some chance of a transfer of power are coming to resemble one-party regimes directed by a minority of the population. ( <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/tennessee-republican-partisanship-one-party-state/674732/">Anne Applebaum&#39;s report</a> from Tennessee is a case history in point.)<br><br> In Florida, Governor Ron DeSantis, Trump&#39;s putative rival for the 2024 Republican nomination, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/ron-desantis-2024-florida-authoritarian/673483/">has turned his state</a> into a laboratory for testing how a determined, calculating, uninhibited authoritarian can maximize executive power. In many respects, he has already accomplished at the state level what Trump did not have the discipline and focus to do at the federal level. And DeSantis has created a blueprint for other Republican state leaders to follow.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/americans-have-lost-sight-what-fascism-means/616846/">Shadi Hamid: Americans are losing sight of what <em>fascism</em> means</a><br><br> Just as state Republicans have become more ruthlessly autocratic in their methods, a new Trump presidency would be much more efficiently goal-oriented  at the federal level. A huge transformation of the administrative state <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/us/politics/trump-plans-2025.html">is being deliberately planned</a> . The government agencies and civil service he has decried as the “deep state” would be purged or politicized, and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/03/donald-trump-rally-waco-2024-campaign/673526/">“retribution”</a> he has promised against his enemies would also be carried out. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/12/10/nathan-simington-christopher-waller-fcc-federal-reserve-appointments-unitary-executive-authority-444136">“unitary executive”</a> theory long promoted by some Republicans would become the reality of an unabashed authoritarianism.<br><br> The very last months of the Trump presidency foreshadowed what a second term would entail. When formerly loyal vassals such as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/14/politics/william-barr-out-as-attorney-general/index.html">Attorney General William Barr</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/nov/09/mark-esper-fired-defence-pentagon-donald-trump">Defense Secretary Mark Esper</a> demonstrated that they would not cross the line into unconstitutional insurgency, Trump sought sycophants for whom no such line existed. In a new Trump administration, total devotion to the leader would be the sole qualification for appointment.<br><br> Unlike previous fascist leaders with their cult of war, Trump still offers appeasement to dictators abroad, but he now promises something much closer to dictatorship at home. For me, what Trump is offering for his second presidency will meet the threshold, and the label I&#39;d choose to describe it would be “isolationist fascism.” Until now, such a concept would have been an oxymoron, a historical phenomenon without precedent. Trump continues to break every mold.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25 Jul 2023 13:15:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-second-term-isolationist-fascism/674791/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/trump-second-term-isolationist-fascism/674791/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The American Evangelical Church Is in Crisis.

“没有人看到教会正处于危机之中吗？”<br><br>它的确是。我是一名保守的福音派人士，曾担任美南浸信会公共政策部门的负责人。多年来，我因反对唐纳德·特朗普以及对种族正义和教会性虐待等问题的看法而受到福音派的强烈反对，其中包括来自我最亲密的盟友和朋友的反对。我几乎不认为自己是一个“持不同政见者”。相反，我相信我还是我一直以来的样子：一个忠诚的美南浸信会福音派信徒，试图运用我从儿童主日学校学到的关于基本基督教道德和正义的知识。尽管如此，我仍感觉自己是一个被遗弃者和异端分子。我感到无家可归。两年前，我离开了我所热爱的美南浸信会世界。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/06/evangelical-church-pastors-political-radicalization/629631/">Tim Alberta: How politics poisoned the evangelical Church</a><br><br>我知道其他福音派人士也有类似的感受。我很难想象有哪个会众不会因政治时刻的动荡而分裂——或者因分裂迫在眉睫而处于紧张的紧张状态。这应该是我们教会复兴的时刻。复兴是美国福音派中一个有着悠久历史的概念，它植根于圣经，它说一个已经变得冷漠、死气沉沉的民族可以在信仰上得到更新。这是一种从死里复活。<br><br>然而，复兴的语言现在充满了愤世嫉俗，并与美国福音派的一些最糟糕的方面联系在一起。富有创业精神的美国福音派为“复兴”建立了一个纲领性的结构——无论是在像我长大的那样的圣经带小教堂的春季和秋季聚会安排中，还是在全国各地举办的大型体育场活动中，比如摇滚音乐会。正如<i>《卫报》</i>在 2016 年总统选举后的一篇社论中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jan/15/the-guardian-view-on-american-christianity-change-and-decay">指出的</a>那样，“最终，市场驱动的宗教催生了市场驱动的真理观，这种发展最终摧毁了美国保守的基督教，让它落入伪君子和小贩的手中。”<br><br>一些福音派基督徒将“复兴”与回到神话般的黄金时代混为一谈。一代人之前，一位福音派领袖表示，宗教右翼的目标应该是 20 世纪 50 年代的美国，只是没有性别歧视和种族主义。如今，就连这些资格也正在消失。调查显示，与其他宗教团体和普通民众相比，白人福音派最容易受到“大替代”理论等白人民族主义比喻的影响，他们的机构将对种族正义的最基本承诺讽刺为“批判种族理论”。那些在承认性虐待掩盖事实方面进展缓慢的教派，很快就会驱逐那些他们认为过于肯定女性领导地位的教会。<br><br>然而，怀旧与复兴的混淆不仅仅是 MAGA 右翼福音派的领域。<i>许多主流福音派人士认为，我们只是在等待一段混乱的时刻结束：如果我们能够安然度过 2016 年总统选举、疫情、种族歧视抗议和强烈反对、2020 年总统选举以及看似持续不断的福音派领袖性虐待丑闻，那么我们最终将安全地回到 2015 年。这显然不会发生。</i><br><br>危机动摇了旧的秩序——正如使徒保罗所说，撕裂了由“木头、干草、残茬”组成的东西（哥林多前书 3:12）。现在，每一刻都可能是一场大灾难——我们周围一直存在的一切都被揭露——因此每一刻都是一个做出决定的时刻。<br><br>将复兴视为回归某个真实或想象的伟大时刻的想法不仅是虚幻的，而且是危险的。在二战后被认为是田园诗般的基督教美国，福音派传教士 AW Tozer 写道：“我深思熟虑的观点是，在目前的情况下，我们根本不想要复兴。我们今天所知道的那种基督教在美国的广泛复兴可能会被证明是一场道德悲剧，我们一百年后也无法从中恢复过来。”托泽尔知道，复兴与怀旧的混淆可能正是<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">在本杂志中将其与圣经巴别塔的毁灭进行了比较</a>。<br><br>然而，巴别塔的问题并不在于碎片化。问题在于团结。建造者们因自己的傲慢而联合起来，建造了最终会毁灭他们的东西。语言的混乱和人口的分散都是上帝的杰作。答案不是重新组合旧的建筑计划并重新开始。答案就在下一章——乌尔的亚伯兰，一个孤独的人物，他听到了一个应许，长途跋涉进入沙漠，却不知道要去哪里。<br><br>解决美国福音派面临的可信度危机的答案并不是为“福音派灵魂”而战，让一个团体获胜并驱逐失败者。约翰·卫斯理和查尔斯·卫斯理并没有取代 18 世纪的英国国教会创建卫理公会，但他们的革新运动仍然在全世界和其他新教教派中引起共鸣。比利·格雷厄姆曾在许多原教旨主义领域被逐出，而他正是在这些领域学会了传播福音，但他却在他的导师们无法做到的地方传播了福音。<br><br>相反，答案始终如一：那些希望坚持旧时代宗教的人必须认识到上帝正在做一些新的事情。旧的联盟和联盟正在瓦解。许多基督徒感到的迷失方向、幻灭感以及政治和宗教“无家可归”的感觉不是一个需要克服的问题，而是这个过程的关键部分。福音派基督教最好的见解是，任何朝圣都不能从确定的路线图开始，而必须从信仰的呼喊开始，就像被错误地标记为怀疑者的高贵门徒托马斯一样，“主啊，我们不知道你要去哪里。我们怎么能认识路呢？” （约翰福音 14:5）。<br><br>怀旧——尤其是煽动者和独裁者所利用的怀旧——无法保护宗教信仰，因为它利用宗教作为实现世俗目的的工具，留下了精神空虚。基督教会仍然需要人们的有机运动，提醒我们其他人，个人转变还有希望，危机带来恩典。<br><br> CS刘易斯指出，上帝几乎从未应允的一个祈祷是“再来一次”。刘易斯写道，只要我们看到它们的本来面目——回忆，而不是蓝图，我们对“过去的黄金时刻”的怀念就可以滋养和维持。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cslewisinstitute.org/resources/reflections-september-2016/">刘易斯说：</a> “如果我们正确地埋藏在过去，而我们不会痛苦地试图唤起过去，它们就会长出精致的花朵。” “别管球茎，新花就会开出来。把它们捡起来，希望通过抚摸和嗅闻来获得去年的花朵，但你什么也得不到。”<br><br>如果福音派否认我们面前危机的严重性，而只是选择那种能够保留昔日联盟和权力结构的公共关系，我们将失去一代人，他们渴望看看福音是真实的，还是只是动员选民或向客户推销的另一种手段。我们将发现自己又陷入了一场竞赛，看看我们可以利用什么样的力量来实现这一目标——一如既往，这将使我们站在钉十字架的一边，而不是站在被钉十字架的一边。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/10/evangelical-trump-christians-politics/620469/">Peter Wehner: The evangelical Church is breaking apart</a><br><br>教会必须停止那些试图保住过去圣经带的疯狂言论和极度缺乏信心。相反，那些配得上<i>“福音派”</i>这个词的人应该培养喜乐、平静、充实的信仰，祈求根植于非常古老的事物的新事物——即对个人信仰和圣经权威的承诺。<br><br>这不是从宣言和战略路线图开始，而是从小规模的决定开始，以重新唤醒福音派所宣称的上帝的敬畏。我们必须重新把注意力集中在皈依上，而不是文化战争上，并真正阅读圣经，而不是挖掘其中的段落来赢得争论。没有人可以单独改变“福音派运动”。改变首先是一个人一个人地发生，然后是一个又一个会众的改变。如果我们中有足够多的人愿意将这种无家可归的感觉视为我们的新常态——我们本来就应该处于这种状态——那么我们就可以重新燃起对一个不同的王国称之为家的渴望。<br><br>在一个为让美国再次伟大而疲惫不堪的国家，也许我们需要的是让福音派重生。<br><br>最终，这不是一个策略。这是一个祈祷。<br><br><small><i>本文改编自拉塞尔·摩尔即将出版的新书《</i>

（“驱逐”），使用了错误的介词，并且无法完全掌握何时使用简单或不完美的过去时。当她开始用意大利语创作故事时，她意识到她永远无法达到用英语创作的能力。但意大利语重新给她的阅读带来了神秘、愉悦和强烈的感觉：“每一页似乎都笼罩着一层薄薄的薄雾，”她写道。 “这些障碍激励着我。每一座新建筑似乎都是一个奇迹。每一个未知的单词都是宝石。”在她的好奇心之下，隐藏着一个更深层次的论点——出于对新技能的热爱，从根本上来说，投入新技能是充满希望的，甚至是超越的。 “我越感觉不完美，”她写道，“我就越感觉自己还活着。”<br><br> <a

2005 年纽约市马拉松比赛进行训练的过程，并反思了认真跑步的生活。这本书接近于自助——章节标题包括“苦难是可选的”和“我通过每天跑步学到的关于写小说的大部分知识”——但整个过程中乐观的辞职气氛改变了它的基调。 “生活基本上是不公平的，”村上写道。 “但即使在不公平的情况下，我认为也有可能寻求一种公平。”你根本无法控制比赛当天发生的事情，就像村上无法控制自己衰老的身体和较慢的完赛时间一样，更不用说他“像一个旧手提箱一样”随身携带的顽固、回避的性格了。这本书令人耳目一新，没有劝告每个人都去跑步。 （事实上​​，作者认为强迫人们这样做是“毫无意义的折磨”，没错。）但他在考艾岛或马萨诸塞州剑桥慢跑的场景，脑子里只想着清晨清新的空气和“我的脚步声、呼吸声和心跳声，所有这些都以独特的多重节奏混合在一起”，这是他们自己的说服力。<br><br><a

英里马拉松的智慧</a><br><br><strong><em>精通程度</em></strong><strong>，作者：安妮·特雷梅尔·威尔考克斯</strong><br><br><em>《精通程度》</em>的第一部分将读者直接带入书籍保护的深处，并且非常引人入胜。威尔考克斯从 1817 年印刷的一本日益恶化的书上切下书脊，拆开装订，然后在去离子水中清洗书页。她小心翼翼地用日本小麦淀粉糊修补裂口，这种糊是用一种叫做“烹饪搅拌”的设备制备的。我知道了一些我不知道有名字的书的名称：例如，连接在精装书书脊上的条纹绳是一个端带。 1987 年，威尔科克斯成为著名图书管理员威廉·安东尼 (William Anthony) 的第一位女学徒，之后他因肝癌去世。她的回忆录详细描述了爱荷华大学图书馆保护部门工作台上的生活，在那里，她在安东尼耐心的注视下修改 15 世纪的古版古书和<em>《草叶集》</em>版本，开始装订书籍。这也是对学徒期本质、对手艺从业者之间的相互学习以及对那些通过拥护自己的知识和理想的学生继续生活的老师的感人思考。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link"

“一个工艺项目，”奥肯写道，“让你可以在手中握住一些具体的东西，即使你周围的一切都在旋转且难以辨认。”她明确表示，手工制作也非常有趣。奥肯带着她在地铁和海滩上编织，并诙谐地列出了她从纤维艺术努力中获得的技能。通过她的眼睛，我们看到了“一大堆双色绿色羊毛、三团未漂白的棉球、一小束丝绸”的无限潜力。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 25
