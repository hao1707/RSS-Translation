href="https://historicjamestowne.org/history/the-first-general-assembly/">全体会议</a>，颁布了“为居住在那里的人民提供快乐指导和治理的正义法律”。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://historicjamestowne.org/history/the-first-general-assembly/">由总督乔治·耶德利爵士组成</a>；他的四位议员；和 22 名当选的“公民”或代表，该团体批准了 30 多项措施。其中包括该国<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://oll.libertyfund.org/page/1619-laws-enacted-by-the-first-general-assembly-of-virginia">第一部枪支法</a>：<br><br><p>任何人不得向任何印第安人出售或给予任何物品、子弹或火药，或任何其他进攻性或防御性武器，否则将被视为殖民地的叛徒，一旦事实得到证实，将被处以绞刑，不得赎回。</p>在早期的枪支管制例子之后，出现了更多限制枪支拥有和使用的法律。如果枪支一直是美国社会的一部分，那么枪支法也是如此。<br><br>这一事实可能会让一些枪支权利倡导者感到惊讶，他们似乎认为美国的过去是枪支所有权不受管制的时期。这一观点在 2022 年得到了大力支持，当时最高法院在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-843_7j80.pdf"><i>纽约州步枪和手枪协会诉布鲁恩案</i></a>中宣布，现代枪支法的合宪性取决于它们是否“符合这个国家枪支管制的历史传统”。 ”换句话说，任何现代枪支法的宪法标准都归结为你是否能在 1700 年代或 1800 年代找到一个好的先例。<br><br>支持者的假设是，这样的先例很少见，但由于研究人员的工作和档案材料的数字化，现在可以参考数千条旧枪支法，各种可以想象的种类。枪支管制法规在美国历史上绝非罕见，而是默认法规。如果<i>布鲁恩案</i>的目的是废除许多枪支法的宪法基础，那么它应该会失败。<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/repository/search-results/?_sf_s=indian">都颁布了与詹姆斯敦类似的法律</a>，以防止枪支落入“敌对者”之手，但这些法律通常是无效的。在接下来的两个世纪里，直到内战之前，对奴隶叛乱的普遍恐惧促使许多殖民地以及后来的州颁布法律<a data-event-element="inline

个州颁布了许可法，通常在某种形式的监督下允许奴役和自由黑人携带武器。<br><br>在共和国历史的这段漫长时期中，直到 20 世纪初， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/guns-across-america-reconciling-gun-rules-and-rights-robert-spitzer/9780190228583?affiliate_id=atl-347">枪支法</a>对各类公民——特别是契约仆人、流浪者、非新教徒、拒绝向政府、重罪犯、外国人、未成年人和受酒精影响的人宣誓效忠。许多法律规范狩猎行为以及枪支的携带、使用、储存和运输；规范枪支的制造、检验、储存和销售；征收枪支许可证；以及受限制的危险或不寻常武器。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/freedmen-race-neutral-supreme-court-affirmative-action-clarence-thomas/674641/">Adam Serwer：最高法院法官提出的最令人困惑的论点</a><br><br>尽管托马斯意见声称“历史记录显示在 18 世纪和 19 世纪完全禁止使用武器的‘敏感地点’相对较少”，但一些地方当局也禁止在城镇、建筑物或道路内或附近开枪。例如天黑后、周日、公共集会和墓地。在某些司法管辖区，任何使用浪费火药的枪支的行为也构成犯罪。<br><br>对违反这些法律的典型处罚是罚款和监禁的结合。在 1700 年代和 1800 年代，由于 1791 年第二修正案的通过和 1868 年第十四修正案的增加，这是法官们主要关注的时期，违反枪支携带和狩猎法也可能导致没收。<br><br>当然，其中一些法律解决了当时特有的问题。例如，从 1600 年代到 1800 年代中期，对保存火药的担忧<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4007491">非常重要</a>，因为它的相对稀缺性使其成为一种珍贵的物质，无论数量如何，手头持有都是危险的，如果储存或处理不当，它很快就会降解。然而，其他类型的法律更直接地对应于现代枪支法规。<br><br>以在公共场合携带枪支或其他危险武器为例。早在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/the-grants-concessions-and-original-constitutions-of-the-province-of-new-jersey-page-289-290-image-293-294-1881-available-at-the-making-of-modern-law-primary-sources/">1686 年</a>，新泽西州就颁布了一项法律，禁止任何“私下佩戴任何袖珍手枪、绞绳、细高跟鞋、匕首或短剑，或其他不寻常或非法武器”的人，因为它们会引起“极大的恐惧和争吵”。这项法律还警告贵族们不要进行我们现在所说的公开携带：“任何<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncpedia.org/gentry">种植园主</a>不得骑马或携带剑、手枪或匕首，否则将受到处罚。”新罕布什尔州于 1744 年通过了一项法律，对任何“携带棍棒或其他武器（包括火器）”且拒绝驱散的十几人或以上的非法集会进行处罚。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1749-51-mass-acts-339-an-act-for-preventing-and-suppressing-of-riots-routs-and-unlawful-assemblies-chap-12-%c2%a7-1/">1751 年</a>，马萨诸塞州也效仿了这一做法。弗吉尼亚州和北卡罗来纳州分别于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1786-va-laws-33-ch-21-an-act-forbidding-and-punishing-affrays/">1786 年</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link"

年</a>通过了类似的禁止公开携带武器的法律。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=4825&amp;context=lcp">在革命后的 1800 年代</a>，随着暴力犯罪的增加导致更多的人武装自己，共有 42 个州（加上哥伦比亚特区）颁布了禁止隐藏携带武器的法律。 1900 年代初又有三个州这样做，因此总数几乎涵盖了联邦的每个州。从 1700 年代到 1900 年代，许多国家也颁布了某种形式的武器许可法。<br><br>那不是全部。同一时期，至少有 22 个州限制携带枪支，包括长枪。此外，在整个时期，四分之三的州制定了禁止“挥舞”（以威胁或威胁的方式挥舞枪支）或仅仅在公共场合展示武器的法律。<br><br>对于现代美国人来说，隐蔽携带就等同于携带手枪。但在 1700 年代和 1800 年代，单发手枪不可靠且不准确，格斗刀成为主要问题。其中最臭名昭著的是鲍伊刀，以吉姆·鲍伊 (Jim Bowie) 的名字命名，据说在 1827 年的一场<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/jim-bowie-stabs-a-louisiana-banker-with-his-famous-knife">战斗</a>中，吉姆·鲍伊 (Jim Bowie) 使用其兄弟雷辛·鲍伊 (Rezin Bowie) 送给他的一把“大刀”杀死了一名男子并打伤了另一名男子。 1836 年这位冒险家在德克萨斯州阿拉莫的死亡事件进一步放大了这种现象，这<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gunandswordcollector.com/product/bowie-knife-norm-flayderman/">刺激了对这把刀的需求</a>，但也刺激了禁止携带这把刀的法律的颁布。 1830 年代，至少有 6 个州通过了此类法律；到本世纪末，除了一个州外，每个州都限制了鲍伊刀。<br><br> <a

<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://firearmslaw.duke.edu/laws/1763-1775-n-j-laws-346-an-act-for-the-preservation-of-deer-and-other-game-and-to-prevent-trespassing-with-guns-ch-539-%c2%a7-10/">新泽西州 1771 年的一项法律将</a>“任何装弹枪的设置方式定为犯罪，即该枪应自行爆炸或放电，或通过任何绳子、绳子或其他装置放电”。从 1850 年代到 1900 年代初，至少有 17 个州颁布了反陷阱枪法。<br><br>据我所知，陷阱枪的使用相对较少，但涉及陷阱枪的事件引起了媒体的广泛关注。缅因州班戈市的一份报纸于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newspapers.com/image/663175190/?terms=%22trap-gun%22&amp;match=1">1870 年 10 月 27 日</a>报道，一名闯入纽约市一家商店的窃贼被机关枪“炸掉了头顶”。该杂志认为，“需要发生一些这样的‘事故’，给最近在这座城市里活动的小偷一个教训。”但大多数当代评论支持反陷阱枪法，因为存在无辜者受伤或死亡的风险，也因为人们对这种私刑式的正义感到厌恶。<br><br>到 19 世纪末，美国发生了巨大的变化，成为一个以城市为主的国家。向工业大都市社会的转变恰逢更便宜、更可靠的手枪的大规模生产和流通增加，导致凶杀案和其他枪支犯罪的增加。新世纪的另一个标志是现代警务的出现，它具有更大的能力来解决这些日益严重的问题；这一发展反映在旨在应对美国城市公共秩序和安全挑战的新一代枪支法中。因此，纽约的<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://theconversation.com/american-gun-culture-is-based-on-frontier-mythology-but-ignores-how-common-gun-restrictions-were-in-the-old-west-184932">我们的民间传说所暗示的</a>那样广泛和不受限制——但枪支法也是如此。<br><br>此外，尽管美国在其历史的大部分时间里都是一个农业国家，一个仍在形成中的现代民族国家，地方政府资源匮乏，权力有限，但其立法者和执法者在确保公共安全方面富有创造力和决心。当他们察觉到枪支对这一秩序构成威胁时，他们就通过法律来限制或阻止枪支。当时，总的来说，没有法院推翻这些法律。<br><br>这才是真正符合我国枪支管理历史传统的。因此，如果我们接受<i>布鲁恩</i>的原旨主义前提，实际结果应该是使一系列广泛的枪支法规符合宪法。<br><br></div>

src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/O_Q86vYrTAtNCkvI_NfZ8VZKN7I=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/how_to_john_wilson_2hr/original.jpg" alt="约翰·威尔逊 (John Wilson)，来自 HBO 的“如何与约翰·威尔逊 (How to With John Wilson)”" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>托马斯·威尔逊/HBO</figcaption></figure>每当我试图向从未听说过该节目的人推荐<em>《如何与约翰·威尔逊》时</em>，我都很难弄清楚从哪里开始。 HBO 将其作为电影制片人约翰·威尔逊 (John Wilson) 的纪录片系列进行营销，在片中他探讨了纽约市最古怪居民的怪异行为。但称其为“纪录片系列”感觉不太对。是的，该节目依赖于威尔逊在城市中漫步时收集的镜头和采访，但这些材料也以喜剧方式呈现。而且它并不完全是“关于”任何事情：有时一集会从一个主题转到另一个主题，以至于到半小时结束时，你几乎不记得自己是从哪里开始的。<br><br>描述威尔逊本人也很困难。表面上他是该剧的明星，但他很少出现在镜头前。相反，他用第二人称的视角来讲述观众所看到的一切，讲述自己的经历。 （例如，当他居住的大楼进行彻底翻修时，他观察到该建筑“很快就把你的公寓变成了你住过的最吵闹的地方之一。”）用他布偶般的声音和尴尬的喉咙——清理时，他听起来经常因为外出而感到紧张。相机似乎是他的盾牌，是他与拍摄对象进行目光接触而不必直视他们的方式。在第一季中，他采访的一位室内设计师温和地批评他有这个习惯。 “我会爱你，有时在你的生活中，在你的脑海中，你会说，‘在这种情况下我应该放下相机，’”她说。 “‘我应该是约翰。’”<br><br>在该剧的最后一季中，威尔逊似乎吸收了她的建议。这位电影制片人之前曾通过提及人际关系和他的朋友，并结合他年轻时的档案片段来展现他的个人生活。但第三季在拆除威尔逊与他的节目之间构建的层层方面取得了重大进展。周五的剧集“如何锻炼”是一系列剧集中的第一集，威尔逊将镜头转向自己，并开始定期在他长期探索的纽约市行政区之外冒险。结果是威尔逊迄今为止最脆弱和最雄心勃勃的作品。如果说在前几季中他是用<em>“如何”</em>来理解周围的世界，那么现在他有目的地试图理解自己，并在这个过程中强调了他的方法的局限性。该剧表明，记录现实总是涉及一定程度的捏造。<br><br>威尔逊被誉为一位慷慨的纪录片导演，他愿意跟随他的拍摄对象深入兔子洞，不加评判地聚焦他们的激情。与喜剧演员兼<em>How To</em>制片人内森·菲尔德 (Nathan Fielder) 制作的非传统系列剧《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/07/the-rehearsal-tv-show-review-nathan-fielder/670546/"><em>排练》(The Rehearsal)</em></a>非常相似，威尔逊的作品因此看起来可能会有些不舒服。两者都展现了我的喜剧，因为他们的主题对他们最奇怪的痴迷是多么天真地开放。在威尔逊的例子中，他故意跟踪那些似乎渴望被倾听并想要解释自己怪癖的人，例如他在杂货店<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIs5tOBDAyM&amp;ab_channel=TheOncomingStorm">遇到的</a>一个男人，他提到他对曼德拉效应的迷恋，曼德拉效应是一种人们集体错误记住重大事件或事件的现象。细节。尽管威尔逊在旁白中从未评论过他所拍摄的内容的奇怪之处，但这些剧集无论如何都传达了他的观点。本季早些时候，他和一名试图将家人搬进没有窗户的导弹发射井的男子一起度过了一段时光。在整个序列中，威尔逊使用了一种令人难以忘怀的配乐，听起来就像是一部阴谋惊悚片，似乎是为了强调这个男人的强迫症对威尔逊来说是多么可笑。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/07/the-rehearsal-tv-show-review-nathan-fielder/670546/">阅读：你从未见过像<em>《排练》</em>这样的东西</a><br><br>然而在最新一集中，威尔逊直面自己将人们的怪癖变成娱乐的冲动。当他前往参加 9 月 11 日主题的健美比赛时（这项赛事具有明显但令人震惊的喜剧潜力），他询问了多名参赛者对他们本应纪念的攻击的记忆，但当他收到的答复是关于精神上的痛苦时，他变得沉默了。艰苦的健美运动也可以。威尔逊遇到一名声称他曾经与一名劫机者共事的培训师后，他在简短的问答后故意剪掉，转而播放一部他小时候在 9/11 录制的自制超级英雄电影。就好像威尔逊本人太痛苦了，无法继续让其他人过度分享，所以他作为替代方案介入，跟随自己进入其中一个兔子洞。<br><br>对于威尔逊来说，这是一种出人意料的技巧，而且当他审视那天下午他为什么要拍一部电影时，也是一种发人深省的技巧。他思考自己作为电影制片人的角色，并思考他的平台如何改变了他，进而改变了他所做的工作。他剪下了自己僵硬地站在艾美奖红地毯上的片段。他插入了他拍摄的埃隆·马斯克(Elon Musk)、玛莎·斯图尔特(Martha Stewart) 和迈克尔·布隆伯格(Michael Bloomberg) 的镜头——这些粗体字的名字是他在高档宴会上与他共用房间的。他提请人们注意，因为他有一档以他的名字命名的 HBO 节目，他的相机如何从他的盾牌变成了他的武器；他放大了时代广场上空的自己的广告牌。 “你喜欢认为你只是从远处观看所有这些事情，”他严肃地叙述道，“但也许这就是你现在的样子。”<br><br>这个坦白让我想起了威尔逊在节目第一集中表达过的一些话。 “你与某人交谈的次数越多，”他沉思道，“就越难隐藏自己的真实身份。”三个多季的<em>《如何》</em>从来都不是一部真正的纪录片或喜剧，而是对故事讲述者和主题之间的微妙界限的探索，以及客观记录现实是多么不可能。威尔逊的好奇心塑造了这部剧，但尽管他试图让自己远离他所观察的内容，但他自己的特点影响了播出的每一秒。 “现在的一切都是表演，”他曾在接受采访时轻蔑地<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/magazine/how-to-john-wilson.html">说</a>，因为他解释了为什么他会被拍摄普通人及其平凡的生活所吸引。在最后一季中，威尔逊听起来似乎已经接受了自己不仅仅是一个偶然发现滑稽人物的纪录片制作人的事实。相反，他是一个扮演角色的角色。<br><br></div>

2019 年秋天进入了宾夕法尼亚大学，并于今年春天毕业。那时，古特曼已经在柏林安顿下来了。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Annie Lowrey：为什么你必须关心这 12 所大学</a><br><br>我并不嫉妒拜登竭尽全力让他的孙女考入一所名牌大学，这是一种令人钦佩的祖父般的奉献精神，也不嫉妒古特曼接受了他的恳求，因为她的工作在很大程度上是为了给他的孙女增添光彩。宾夕法尼亚大学。尽管如此，他们之间的关系仍然引人注目。人们通常会期望大学校长对美国前副总统表现出关心，而不是相反。<br><br>但古特曼并不是任何一所大学的校长。她是常春藤联盟大学的校长，这让一切变得不同。她与拜登家族的关系是常春藤盟校及其同行机构巨大影响力的完美升华，并且表明了这种影响力可能会如何消失。<br><br>凭借数十亿美元的捐赠，美国最优秀的大学在近几十年来已将自己转变为美国大众富裕人群的“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.folger.edu/explore/shakespeares-works/henry-v/read/5/2/">礼仪制造者</a>”。通过将富人和有权势的孩子与指定弱势群体的孩子混合在一起，他们产生了新的进步精英，对国家的文化和政治生活拥有巨大的影响力。现在，随着常春藤+的招生实践受到左翼和右翼的严格审查，这种强大的炼金术正面临风险，为一批新的精英培养机构打开了大门。<br><br>古特曼杰出的前任美国驻德国大使之一是詹姆斯·布莱恩特·科南特（James Bryant Conant），他曾担任美国驻德国高级专员，然后在冷战初期担任美国首任驻德国大使。与之类似的是，科南特在担任哈佛大学校长 20 年后担任了这一职位。<br><br>在科南特时代和古特曼时代之间，美国的精英高等教育达到了其权力的顶峰。但科南特对哈佛大学的愿景和古特曼对宾夕法尼亚大学的愿景截然不同。<br><br>科南特出身于波士顿的工人阶级童年，他曾致力于将哈佛从一所 WASP 精英的精修学校转变为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-big-test-the-secret-history-of-the-american-meritocracy-nicholas-lemann/9780374527518?affiliate_id=atl-347">一所更加精英化的机构</a>，他要求大学管理人员找到一种能力倾向测试，以选拔全美最聪明、最优秀的人才。有能力的年轻人，这构成了后来SAT的基础。他相信哈佛可以帮助实现“杰斐逊的理想”，即一个由热心公益的知识精英领导的国家，这些精英是通过严格的、基于证据的程序选出的。对于许多美国人来说，科南特论文的某些版本是哈佛大学和类似机构地位提升的最令人信服的理由，这就是为什么背离精英理想往往会破坏常春藤联盟精英的合法性。<br><br>这种<i>精英主义的精英主义</i>从未在实践中得到充分实现，尤其是在常春藤盟校。其一，科南特本人主持了犹太人的配额制度，他被指责<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/194316">至少</a>对反犹太主义的祸害漠不关心。此后的几十年里，一大批大学管理者放弃了精英统治，转而建立了一种不同的、可以说更强大的精英基础。精英高等教育不再一心关注学术卓越，而是采取了更加多元化的方法，将仅根据学术证书选择的学生与其他旨在丰富大学生活的学生混合在一起，无论是象征性的还是字面意义上的。在这一时期的大部分时间里，这些对精英管理范式的背离被视为对筹款和其他平淡的制度目标的必要性的让步。然而，近年来，这种招生多元化品牌在道德上发生了转变。称之为<i>进步精英主义</i>。<br><br> 1995 年 5 月，时任劳伦斯·S·洛克菲勒大学政治学教授兼普林斯顿大学教务长的古特曼在斯坦福大学发表了备受尊敬的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tannerlectures.utah.edu/_resources/documents/a-to-z/g/Gutmann96.pdf">坦纳人类价值观讲座</a>。她的言论集中在种族不平等上，她称之为“这个国家公共生活中在道德和智力上最令人烦恼的问题”。<br><br>古特曼的核心论点之一是，因为“有效解决种族不公正问题的公共政策和个人实践是集体利益”，“黑人批评那些从他们打击种族不公正的努力中受益但无所作为的其他黑人是公平合理的”帮助这一事业或同样紧迫的事业。”也就是说，美国黑人“需要团结起来，通过支持平权行动政策等方式打击种族不平等”。<br><br>古特曼认为，不仅仅是美国黑人在这一领域负有特殊义务。 “我们承受的种族负担越少，”她认为，“我们克服种族不平等的义务就越大。”非黑人美国人“负有与种族不公正作斗争的特殊义务，以减少他们成为不公平优势受益者的可能性，这些不公平优势源于社会职务的种族成见和其他形式的制度化不公正，使黑人不公平地处于不利地位。”<br><br>如果古特曼是对的，即优势个人和群体有特殊义务避免加剧种族不平等的不公平优势，那么我们应该如何理解拜登总统为确保他的孙女进入宾夕法尼亚大学而做出的共同努力——或者更确切地说，我们应该如何期待政治哲学家艾米·古特曼明白吗？<br><br>一个可能的解决方案是，为达到目的不择手段。也就是说，如果特权阶层有利于种族和社会正义的更大事业，那么他们利用自己的地位、关系和财富来获得高地位的教育机会是合理且适当的。<br><br>处于古特曼立场的人可能会坚持认为，因为她控制的机构与她和她的同龄人认为值得的事业保持一致，所以招收能够增强其中心地位和声望的学生本身就是一种崇高的追求。对平等主义的承诺不仅赋予宾夕法尼亚大学和类似的大学道德许可，而且赋予他们以国家最有特权家庭的子孙来强化学生群体的道德义务。这样做为像古特曼这样的进步大学校长提供了塑造美国新一代精英的强大工具。<br><br>至关重要的是，这个精英塑造项目需要一个更广泛接受的合法性理论。如果说精英精英主义的合理性在于需要向最优秀、最聪明的人灌输爱国主义和公民责任感，那么进步精英主义的合理性在于需要使美国精英多元化。这意味着增加美国黑人和其他历史上处于不利地位的群体在美国公共生活中扮演重要角色的代表性，但这也意味着保护和加强常春藤盟校作为机会瓶颈的作用。在进步精英主义的影响下，常春藤盟校不仅仅是王朝财富与第一代奋斗者的活力交汇的地方。这是美国精英获得道义认可的地方。<br><br><i>学生公平招生诉哈佛</i>案揭示了这种精英培养方法在实践中的运作方式。学生公平招生是一个反对种族偏好的非营利性法律倡导组织，它聘请杜克大学劳动经济学家彼得·阿尔西迪亚科诺（Peter Arcidiacono）来分析谁被哈佛录取，谁没有被哈佛录取，并利用了该校多年来有义务与他人分享的严密保护的数据。原告。他的<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/papers/w26316">提请注意</a>哈佛大学对招募的运动员、遗产、院长感兴趣名单上的未来学生以及教职员工子女 (ALDC) 的偏好，在某些情况下，这种偏好非常大。<br><br>对阿尔西迪亚科诺的发现感到震惊，批评者和种族意识招生的拥护者联合起来谴责对 ALDC 的偏好，这是跨意识形态一致的罕见例子。但种族偏好和对 ALDC 的偏好从根本上来说是互补的，正是这种互补性成为进步精英主义的基石。<br><br>越来越多的证据表明，精英教育的主要优势不是教学质量，而是它提供的与有权势人士建立关系的机会。在<i>《纽约时报》</i>最近的一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/opinion/alumni-affirmative-action-legacy-admissions.html">专栏文章</a>中，普林斯顿大学社会学家沙姆斯·汗 (Shamus Khan) 描述了来自特权阶层和弱势背景的学生的社会联系如何能够为后者带来好处。<br><br>汗写道：“从精英学校毕业，你可以加入一个杰出的组织，为你提供与身居高位的朋友的联系，并让你适应高地位环境的惯例和礼仪。”但是，虽然来自特权背景的学生甚至在进入哈佛或宾夕法尼亚大学等院校之前就可以接触到富裕、受过教育、有专业成就的成年人的网络，但地位较低的学生却不能。当这些学生聚集在一起时，那些享有特权的学生会获得一种被认可的感觉——他们的智力、成就和性格——而那些地位较低的学生则获得社会和文化资本，从而加速他们大学毕业后的职业提升。<br><br>尽管可汗并不是传统偏好的捍卫者，但他观察到，“传统学生拥有深厚的社会和文化联系，是弱势学生从精英学校获得如此多好处的部分原因。”这种逻辑不仅适用于传统学生，也适用于其他特权学生，包括杰出民选官员的子孙、主要慈善家、学术和文化名人，甚至可能还有成就斐然的马术运动员和壁球运动员。<br><br>进步精英主义不仅仅塑造精英大学学生的举止、道德和生活轨迹。它使招生人员能够更大规模地参与灵魂艺术。<br><br> 2010 年，经济学家瓦莱丽·拉米 (Valerie Ramey) 和加里·拉米 (Garey Ramey) 发现，自 20 世纪 90 年代中期以来，名牌大学入学<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2010a_bpea_ramey.pdf">竞争的加剧</a>导致受过大学教育的美国父母投入到孩子成长上的时间和资源急剧增加。 In contrast, there was no comparable increase in rivalry among parents in Canada, where the prestige hierarchy in higher education is not nearly as steep. The Rameys conclude that the net result of this intensified competition has been a wasteful, zero-sum “rug rat race.”<br><br> Building on this empirical foundation, the essayist Matt Feeney goes further still. In his 2021 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/little-platoons-a-defense-of-family-in-a-competitive-age-matt-feeney/9781541645592?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Little Platoons</i></a> , he denounces the hubris of selective college admissions, accusing admissions officers of arrogating to themselves extraordinary power over the inner lives of aspirational parents and their children.<br><br> Faced with a surge of applications as Millennials came of age, Feeney posits, “admissions people came to grasp that the selection power this competition had given them was also a deep and subtle sort of moral power … They could now tell their applicants which extracurriculars were <i>better</i> , and which sort of personal confessions were more pleasing in admissions essays, which sorts of person, as manifest in these essays and extracurriculars, they liked more.” By signaling these behavioral preferences to parents, teachers, counselors, and anxious young strivers highly susceptible to small gradations of status, admissions officers found that “they could now induce their applicants to become such people.”<br><br> A number of scholars and practitioners have called for using selective college admissions to “nudge” parents and students in several ways. In 2017, for example, Thomas Scott-Railton published a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://yalelawandpolicy.org/shifting-scope-how-taking-school-demographics-account-college-admissions-could-reduce-k-12">provocative article</a> in the <i>Yale Law &amp; Policy Review</i> urging elite colleges to give a substantial admissions bonus to applicants who had attended high-poverty K–12 schools even if they were not from low-income households themselves. “By rewarding applicants for attending socioeconomically integrated schools,” he argued, “colleges would mobilize the resources of private actors across the country towards integration.”<br><br> Leaving aside the merits of this particular proposal, it speaks to the extraordinary power that elite higher education has over the nation&#39;s middle-class-and-up families. Scott-Railton&#39;s proposal could be seen as an exercise in having Ivy League institutions advance a policy objective that Congress would likely reject. Striking legislative bargains in a culturally plural society is hard. Winning over the admissions office is a significantly lighter lift.<br><br> This disciplinary power has an ideological character, and it&#39;s not always subtle. In 2018, an admissions officer at Yale University published <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://admissions.yale.edu/bulldogs-blogs/hannah/2018/02/23/support-student-protests">a note</a> reassuring prospective applicants and admitted students that they wouldn&#39;t be penalized for suspensions or other disciplinary action imposed by their high schools for taking part in gun-control activism. “For those students who come to Yale,” she wrote, “we expect them to be versed in issues of social justice.” Imagine a similar note cheering on prospective applicants to Yale for taking part in the March for Life—and then imagine the opprobrium that would follow for the admissions officer who published it.<br><br> The result is that the opportunity choke point of elite college admissions has become, in the hands of progressive administrators and admissions officers, a tool for transforming progressive pieties into elite social norms.<br><br> And that leads us to why Ivy League eliteness may have peaked.<br><br> If progressive elitism has allowed selective universities to reconcile moralistic progressivism with the elitism that is the source of their desirability, what happens when Ivy League admissions officers&#39; power to reshape social norms is no longer undergirded by an appeal to racial justice? Since the Supreme Court&#39;s <i>Students for Fair Admissions</i> decision curtailed racial preferences, legacy preferences have come under vigorous attack, not least from the Biden administration, which has launched <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.yahoo.com/education-department-opens-civil-rights-233234623.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHOOaerPzinmGOtuHDAffHX5PSjL6lIfzs-_3utmYcp1ytXA3AEsLIpD35KQkKHeK-bmtuoCjLJryCZUQxOJXxCm9CFeC3L3ey5O77T1Fk3bm1hvjUXGVxvdZyeH9ZiAzMLlIdjDFoqcIVYDGnNKwXg2RaZeYboiWeSrHrTTupXj">a civil-rights investigation</a> into Harvard&#39;s use of the practice.

If Shamus Khan is right, although the symbolic value of an elite education for less advantaged students might persist beyond the end of legacy admissions, its value as a source of social and cultural capital will be greatly diminished.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/ban-legacy-college-admissions-nepotism/629566/">Richard V. Reeves: The shame deficit</a><br><br> This in turn could create an opening for a different set of higher-education institutions committed to a different set of values—perhaps even a revival of the midcentury vision of elite institutions that would promote social mobility while instilling patriotism and a sense of civic obligation.<br><br> That, at least, seems to be the impetus behind a slew of new higher-education initiatives in red and purple states, where many voters, policy makers, and philanthropists are wary of Ivy League progressivism. The School of Civic and Economic Thought and Leadership at Arizona State University, a public research university that has seen <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/local/phoenix/2022/06/13/arizona-undergraduate-enrollment-surges-nation-sees-decline">surging enrollment</a> in recent years, is pioneering an approach to civics that welcomes debate and encourages a deep understanding of the nation&#39;s founding principles. In Tennessee, Governor Bill Lee is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.utdailybeacon.com/campus_news/academics/gov-lee-announces-6m-civics-institute-at-ut-to-combat-anti-american-thought/article_b8f0588c-83af-11ec-a0a0-3329895fa268.html">creating</a> a similar institute, which aims to inculcate an “informed patriotism,” through the state university system.<br><br> And then there is the Hamilton Center for Classical and Civic Education at the University of Florida, a new initiative that is being led by Will Inboden, a distinguished scholar of international relations who most recently taught at the University of Texas at Austin. With more than 60,000 students at its Gainesville campus, UF is already one of the nation&#39;s most respected public universities and, in light of the Sunshine State&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-06-29/millions-move-to-the-south-as-us-economy-favors-its-wealth-job-opportunities">rapid economic and demographic expansion</a> , it is well positioned for further growth. The Hamilton Center, aimed at fostering diversity of thought and improving the quality of civic education on campus and throughout the state, represents a bet on UF&#39;s enormous potential. One possibility is that it will serve as the seedbed of a new liberal-arts college that would compete with the likes of Penn and Harvard, attracting bright and capable students from a wide range of social and ethnic backgrounds. To date, UF hasn&#39;t distinguished itself as <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://washingtonmonthly.com/2022-college-guide/national/">a beacon of social mobility</a> . But that could soon change.<br><br> No one expects these fledgling efforts to dislodge the Ivy League and its peers from their place at the top of America&#39;s higher-education status hierarchy, at least not yet. What we can say is that many young Americans and their families are looking for alternatives to elite education as we&#39;ve come to know it, and a growing number of civic entrepreneurs are hoping to revive something like the still-resonant meritocratic ideal.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 12 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/ivy-league-legacy-admissions/674986/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/ivy-league-legacy-admissions/674986/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Comebacker]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A short story <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/3B0sKKzdKy8Puh3r-ro_qwDytv8=/0x10:2252x2825/648x810/media/img/2023/07/31/0923_FIC_Eggers_Comebacker/original.jpg" alt="illustration of person standing alone and casting long shadow on pastel-pink baseball field in huge empty stadium with bird flying overhead" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> T <span class="smallcaps">he day was cold</span> , cold even for August in San Francisco. As Lionel walked over the Lefty O&#39;Doul Bridge, the wind seemed to be coming from every direction—the Pacific, the bay, the brackish creek underfoot. And with every step, Lionel&#39;s left shoe squeaked, an especially maddening thing, given that he&#39;d just had them resoled. For years he&#39;d passed a subterranean shoemaker&#39;s shop, thinking it would be old-timey and fun to engage the ancient Romanian proprietor in some project. Finally Lionel had entered the man&#39;s tiny shop and asked him to resole his favorite leather shoes, so soft they felt like moccasins. The whole encounter had been as quaint and satisfying as expected, until Lionel retrieved the shoes a week later and found that the left one now let out a cartoonish squeak with every footfall.<br><br> When Lionel went back to the shoemaker, the old man shrugged. “Some shoes squeak,” he said.<br><br> Lionel had learned to walk on the edge of his left foot. This decreased the sound, but gave him a worrying gait. People at the stadium had begun asking him about it.<br><br> Lionel covered the Giants for the <i>Examiner</i> —the home games at least. The paper didn&#39;t have the budget to send him on the road. The season was effectively over anyway; the team had no chance at the playoffs, and the mood in the clubhouse was dour. Not that the players were so garrulous in winning, either. Sydney Coletti saw to that.<br><br> Brought in to head the media-relations department, she&#39;d drilled the players on verbal discipline, and day after day, they dispensed word clusters that made sense but said nothing: “Trying to contribute.” “Just focused on getting the win.” “Great team effort.” “Happy to be here.”<br><br> Sydney strode around the stadium in beautiful suits, sunglasses embedded in her raven hair. As if aware of her imperious affect, she often brought in treats—candy, cupcakes, huge bars of artisanal chocolate. She was polished and warm, but had no qualms about limiting access if a reporter crossed her. So Lionel had traded candor for access, and loathed himself for it.<br><br> “Nice work, Lionel,” Sydney said when she approved of something he&#39;d written. It was a terrible thing, to be praised this way.<br><br> “Get me sticky,” Lionel&#39;s editor, Warren, demanded.<br><br> The problem was that when a player said something even vaguely sticky—Warren&#39;s word for memorable, colorful, controversial—the sportswriters pounced, and often the player paid the price. Apologies followed, and lost endorsement deals, diminished love from fickle fans, a requested trade, a new team. That, or a player could just keep his mouth shut.<br><br> <i>Squeak, squeak, squeak.</i><br><br> Lionel entered at the stadium&#39;s media gate and made his way through the dim hallways to the locker room, where he showed his lanyard to Gregorio, the security guard.<br><br> “Hannah beat you,” he said.<br><br> “Beat me how?” Lionel said, thinking it could be any of 10, 12 ways. There she was, interviewing Hector Jiménez.<br><br> Hannah Tanaka was technically his competition, in that she wrote for the <i>Chronicle</i> , the larger of the two valiant locals. But from the time he&#39;d started on the Giants beat, she&#39;d done everything humanly possible to help Lionel—introducing him to every staffer at the stadium, sharing every tip and data point—and he&#39;d quickly fallen in love with her. She was so steady, so funny; her laugh was raspy, almost lewd.<br><br> <i>Squeak, squeak, squeak.</i><br><br> She turned when she heard him. She had her notebook out, and her phone—she had some transcription app that converted everything a player said to text, instantly—but she looked at Lionel and smirked. That smirk! Good lord.<br><br> She was married, though, and had two teenage girls, and so every year Lionel had gotten better at disguising his heartache. During the games, they sat next to each other, bantering, complaining, comparing notes, and with every word she said, in her low, clenched-jaw way, he was stung by the great injustice of finding his favorite person, sitting next to her every day, but heading home each day alone.<br><br> Lionel looked around. He could talk to the second baseman, Hollis, who had some kind of problem with his heel, but what was the point? Warren wouldn&#39;t give him space for news of another almost-injury to a player on a losing team.<br><br> Hannah finished with Jiménez and sidled up to Lionel. “Behold the new guy,” she said, and nodded to a gangly man in the corner. She handed Lionel the day&#39;s media packet and pointed to the relevant paragraph about a middle reliever, Nathan Couture, being called up from AAA Sacramento. “Get him before Sydney puts the muzzle on,” Hannah said.<br><br> The man in the corner was holding the sleeves of his uniform apart, apparently dumbfounded to find his own name, <span class="smallcaps">COUTURE</span> , stitched to the back of a Giants jersey.<br><br> “Nathan?” Lionel asked.<br><br> The pitcher turned around and smiled. His teeth were small, and he was missing his left canine; it gave him a look of youthful incompletion. He had a narrow, pockmarked face and a weak chin. A wispy mustache overhung his stern, chapped lips.<br><br> “First time in the majors?” Lionel asked.<br><br> “Indeed,” Nathan said.<br><br> That word—it wasn&#39;t heard so much in a locker room. Lionel wrote “indeed” in his notebook, and then asked the most inane, and most common, query in sports. “How does it feel?” It hurt to utter the words.<br><br> But Nathan nodded and inhaled and exhaled expansively through his nostrils, as if this was the most provocative question he&#39;d ever heard.<br><br> “When I got the call, just yesterday, I was elated,” Nathan said.<br><br> Lionel heard an accent. Rural. Southeastern maybe. Georgia? He wrote down “Elated” and underlined it.<br><br> “The drive from Sacramento was a fever dream,” Nathan continued. “The scenery rushed by like meltwater. And then to get here, to this cathedral, to warm up, and to meet these men at the top of their craft”—he swept his arm around the room, now filled with a dozen or so players in towels and jockstraps; one was jiggling his leg, as if to awaken it—“and to be welcomed by them without condition, and now to see my name on this shirt … I have to say, it&#39;s sublime.”<br><br> Lionel wrote and underlined “sublime.” He looked around to see if he was being pranked. But no one was listening; no one was near.<br><br> “I&#39;m sorry, I didn&#39;t get your name,” Nathan said, and extended his hand. Lionel introduced himself, and found that Nathan was examining his face with a friendly but jarring intensity. He rested his eyes on Lionel&#39;s notebook. “Do you take shorthand?”他问。<br><br> Lionel&#39;s handwriting was a chaotic mix of cursive and all caps—a madman&#39;s scrawl. “No, no,” he said. “This is just my personal code, I guess.”<br><br> In four years, no player had ever asked even the vaguest question about Lionel&#39;s process or profession.<br><br> “I assume you&#39;ll call me a journeyman,” Nathan said.<br><br> Lionel had just written that exact word. He quickly crossed it out.<br><br> “Don&#39;t, don&#39;t,” Nathan said. “I like the word, and for me it&#39;s apt. And removed from baseball, it&#39;s a good word, don&#39;t you think? Journey-man. I know not everyone loves it, since it implies a kind of purgatory just below success, but in isolation, the word has a simple beauty to it, right? How could you not want to be called a journey-man?”<br><br> Lionel looked at the word he&#39;d obliterated. “I guess so.” He circled it. When he glanced up again, Nathan was looking down at him with priestly interest.<br><br> “Did you dream of this work as a boy?”他问。<br><br> Lionel couldn&#39;t speak. He returned to the assumption that this was a prank. He looked around. No one looked back.<br><br> “I&#39;m sorry. I shouldn&#39;t probe like that,” Nathan said, and laid a hand on Lionel&#39;s shoulder. “I just had the sudden awareness that the two of us are in the enviable, even surreal position of living out our most impossible dreams. The fact that we aren&#39;t digging ditches or mining coal—that I&#39;m paid to play a game and you&#39;re paid to watch a game and tell people what you see—it seems, in a world of sadness and misfortune, to be a thing of great luck. Don&#39;t you think?”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Lionel watched</span> the game in a daze. He sat in the press box, Hannah on his right. On his left was Marco DaSilva, in his mid-20s, round-shouldered and stat-obsessed, and for some reason doing AM radio, where the average listener was 76. Lionel read, and reread, his notes, while hoping Nathan Couture would be called in to pitch.<br><br> “Interesting guy?” Hannah asked.<br><br> “His numbers are shit,” Marco said.<br><br> It was not right to withhold anything from them, but Lionel kept the strange interview to himself. The Giants lost badly and Nathan didn&#39;t play, and somewhere along the way, Hannah, bored by Lionel&#39;s distracted state, moved to sit next to Marco, and made a show of having an especially good time with this new seating arrangement.<br><br> Lionel wrote up the game, but because Nathan hadn&#39;t been a factor, it made no sense to include him. He&#39;d play sooner or later, Lionel figured, at which point he could get him into a story. Maybe Warren would let him do a profile.或者可能不是。 Warren didn&#39;t generally like human-interest stories.<br><br> That night, Lionel went online, searching for Nathan Couture. His hometown was Thomasville, Alabama. He was 28 and had never been to college. His statistics were unremarkable in every way, which meant he was unlikely to remain in the majors for any stretch of time. He was both average and old. A mediocre pitcher who was happy to be in the bigs, and who asked about Lionel&#39;s work and method? What was he thinking?<br><br> Nathan was sent back to Sacramento the next day.<br><br> When Nathan stepped out, he waited on the warning track, taking a long breath. He walked onto the grass like it was the first step of a royal staircase.<br><br> Lionel wrote up his summaries of the games that week, printing the players&#39; inanities, and Sydney baked white-chocolate brownies, which were exceptional.<br><br> “I don&#39;t like her baking, actually,” Marco said. He and Hannah and Lionel were watching batting practice on another cool August afternoon.<br><br> “Her cookies are brittle,” Hannah said. Lionel hadn&#39;t thought about Sydney&#39;s cookies that way before, but they were definitely on the crumbly side. Soon the three of them had turned on all the food in the stadium. The garlic fries, which had been so crisp last season, were now less crisp, and the little pepperonis on the pizzas had dropped a few notches.<br><br> “Remember when they were sort of curly?” Lionel asked.<br><br> The gates of complaint were now open. The architects of the park, they agreed, had not allotted enough elevators, so the writers often had to wait—sometimes many minutes—to get from the field to the press box.<br><br> “And the paper towels!” Marco said suddenly, tragically.<br><br> In the bathrooms closest to the press box, the paper-towel dispensers had been replaced by air dryers, which they all agreed were too loud.<br><br> “Well,” Marco said, his voice weary, “I guess we should go inside and get the lineup for tonight.”<br><br> Lionel grabbed the copy Sydney had put in his cubby and saw Nathan&#39;s name. He felt a flutter of excitement that embarrassed him.<br><br> “Couture is back,” Hannah said, and Lionel nodded, giving away nothing.<br><br> The game began, and by the sixth inning, with the Giants up 5–0, it was highly unlikely they would need Nathan. He was the third or fourth middle reliever on the roster, and the starter was still soaring.<br><br> But the Padres hacked a series of singles into shallow left and right, and suddenly it was 5–3, then 5–4. The manager made his way to the mound and took the ball, and the starter walked to the dugout, head low and muttering. Lionel looked to the bullpen to see who would emerge.<br><br> When Nathan stepped out, he waited on the warning track, taking a long breath. He walked onto the grass like it was the first step of a royal staircase, and then broke into a steady trot. The rest of his entrance and preparations were routine. He kicked the dirt and took his warm-up pitches. His face appeared on the massive outfield screen, in a goofy photo, and 20,000 fans wondered, idly, who he was. Then, without fuss, he struck out the first batter with three pitches.<br><br> “Damn,” Marco said, and typed feverishly for a while. Lionel assumed he was looking for some numerical context for what had just happened.<br><br> The next batter hit a rope toward left. Winebrenner, the third baseman, knocked it down but bobbled it, and there was a runner on first.<br><br> When the third man up hit a dribbler to second, Hollis fielded it—clumsily—and flipped it to the shortstop, who stepped on second and threw to first for a double play.<br><br> “Okay,” Hannah said. “Okay.” For Hannah, this was high praise.<br><br> Next inning, Nathan took care of the first three batters in much the same way—with crafty pitch selection and pinpoint placement. When the third hitter fouled a ball high, Nathan ran after it, briefly confusing the first baseman, who waved him off and caught it.<br><br> Between innings, Hannah took a cryptic call.<br><br> “Huh,” she said. Apparently Hollis, the second baseman, was getting an MRI. The heel that had been bothering him was now shot. Something had happened during that double play.<br><br> More experienced pitchers closed out the eighth and ninth, and that was that. The Giants won, 5–4. Down in the locker room, the early word on Hollis&#39;s heel was bad. Warren would not want the story of Nathan Couture, not on the night the starting second baseman got injured. Lionel wandered over to Nathan anyway. Most of the players had showered already, but Nathan was still in his uniform.<br><br> “Is that corny?” Nathan asked. “I wanted to savor it a bit longer.”<br><br> Hollis seesawed into the room on crutches and the reporters swarmed. The professional thing to do would be to go over and hear from the player who&#39;d won four Gold Gloves and was being paid $12 million. But Lionel stayed with Nathan.<br><br> “I noticed you paused when you first stepped out,” he said.<br><br> “I did,” Nathan said. “I assume you want to know how it felt?”<br><br> Lionel smiled and licked the tip of his pen theatrically.<br><br> “It was big,” Nathan said.<br><br> Lionel wrote down “It&#39;s big” and for a moment, he wondered if Nathan&#39;s earlier eloquence had been a fluke.<br><br> “Kidding, Lionel. Truly, I think it&#39;s a happy, wholly irrational spectacle,” he said. “Don&#39;t you think? I mean—”<br><br> “Hold on,” Lionel said, and scrambled for his tape recorder.<br><br> Nathan took a deep breath. “I mean, those upper-deck seats are probably 200 feet up. Think of it. Twenty-five thousand people were here tonight, some of them sitting 200 feet in the air, to see men play as silly a game as has ever been conjured. Balls and bats and bases—all of it perfected and professionalized, sure, but essentially childish and irrelevant. And to serve it, to celebrate it, this billion-dollar coliseum is built. People come 100 miles to watch it under 1,000 lights. When you and I first met, it was a day game, a completely different atmosphere. At night the stadium takes on the look of deep space. The sky is so black, the lights so white, illuminating a surreal sea of green. When you jog out there, as I did, in the dark, it feels, briefly, like you&#39;re in a spaceship, approaching a new planet.”<br><br> Hector Jiménez, the catcher whose locker was next to Nathan&#39;s, had begun listening, and was giving Nathan a disapproving look.<br><br> “There was some confusion over that foul ball,” Lionel said, and already Nathan was nodding.<br><br> “First of all,” he said, “that ball was rightfully Gutierrez&#39;s, but it started out over my head, and that northeast wind took it toward the first-base line. So I had it in my sights, but then it evaporated. I mean, it ceased to be!”<br><br> Lionel caught Jiménez&#39;s eye. He looked alarmed, horrified.<br><br> “And for a long moment,” Nathan continued, “as I searched the void for the ball, I thought, <i>I&#39;ve caught a million balls. How could I lose this one?</i> And then I thought, <i>Why am I here? Where are my legs? Are my arms still raised? Why can&#39;t I see?</i> The sky was so black, and this solid thing, this baseball, had utterly disappeared in it! So I wondered if the ball had been real, and if I was real, if anything was real.”<br><br> Jiménez tossed his gear into his duffel and zipped it loudly.<br><br> “Then I smelled roast beef!” Nathan said, and laughed loudly, placing his hand on Lionel&#39;s shoulder. “I thought, <i>Is that roast beef I smell? Who brought roast beef to the ballpark?</i> Then Gutierrez yelled, &#39;Move, kid, I got it!&#39; and my eyes swung toward him. As they did, I saw the blur of 1,000 faces in the stands beyond first. Then he caught the ball.”<br><br> Jiménez walked away. Seconds later, Sydney appeared. She always grew suspicious when interviews ran long.<br><br> “Everything good over here?”她问。<br><br> “Fine,” Lionel said, but the interview was over.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Lionel had</span> to wait a few days for the drama of Hollis&#39;s injury to play out before asking Warren for some space in the paper to profile Nathan. Warren had zero interest in it, especially since Nathan hadn&#39;t played again. But then one day an ad dropped out, so on page 23, Lionel was allotted six column inches to introduce “Nathan Couture, Pitcher With Unique Outlook.” He did little more than print the two long quotes he&#39;d gotten from Nathan before Sydney had hustled him away, but the article made an impression.<br><br> “You have to play me that tape,” Hannah said, clearly dubious.<br><br> All the reporters wanted to talk to Nathan, but Nathan was suddenly unavailable. Sydney felt they&#39;d dodged a bullet in having this eccentric Alabaman talk and talk and somehow avoid a catastrophic mistake. She would not risk it again. But then she said she would.<br><br> “The owner insisted on it,” Warren said.<br><br> The octogenarian owner of the team had evidently read Lionel&#39;s article, and was an immediate fan of Nathan&#39;s. He wanted Nathan in games, and wanted Nathan to talk, as much as he could, before and after games. The owner, viewed as an eccentric himself (though from Kansas), was assumed to be not long for this world. Three days after Nathan&#39;s first outing, he pitched the eighth inning of another tight game, and again he held his own, and the Giants won. This time, he had to bat, and actually stroked a line drive into Triples Alley. Against the wishes of the first-base coach, Nathan rounded first base and was easily tagged out at second. It made for a comical and eventful inning, and the home crowd went berserk.<br><br> Afterward, a scrum of reporters surrounded him, and Lionel, who had unwisely waited for the elevator, found himself in the third ring. He felt oddly proprietary, even jilted. He wanted, to a degree that filled him with shame, some kind of acknowledgment from Nathan that he was different, that he had been first.<br><br> Nathan looked around and smiled broadly. “Well, this is extraordinary.”<br><br> Hannah was closest. “General thoughts, Mr. Couture?”<br><br> Nathan stared at the ceiling for a while, as if peeling back the many layers of the query, then rested his eyes upon her.<br><br> “First I thought about the smell of the grass,” he said. “They cut it today, so the smell was fresh and just a bit sour, as newly cut grass is. There&#39;s something both wet and dry at the same time, both dead and alive. I inhaled a bit longer than usual, wanting to take everything in, and I saw four men, all gray-haired, arm in arm in the stands, posing for a picture. Then the Jumbotron showed a picture of the same men, as teenagers, at a ball game. Same four guys, same pose, just 50-odd years ago. And I had the feeling that the four of them, whenever they stand side by side like that, probably feel invincible.”<br><br> “Nathan, I—”<br><br> Another reporter broke in, thinking Nathan was finished. But Lionel knew he wasn&#39;t.<br><br> “Then I saw a seagull. Maybe you did too? It hovered over home plate for a moment, maybe 20 feet up. Under the lights it looked like a tiny angel. I wondered what brought this bird, alone, to the ballpark. No doubt he hoped he might come across some discarded chips or fries, but the risk is considerable, too. Wouldn&#39;t the lights, and 30,000 people, be daunting? But then again, he can fly. Is anything daunting when you can fly? And briefly I thought about the nature of flight. I do think there will come a time when humans can fly more or less as birds do, and I wondered how that would affect our idea of freedom. Will anyone ever feel constrained, spiritually or materially, if they can fly?”<br><br> Lionel wrote down “If we can fly.”<br><br> “And then it was time to pitch,” Nathan said. There was scattered laughter, and the exchange of looks. Nathan was stranger in person than he had been in Lionel&#39;s article. A dozen hands went up.<br><br> “Oh jeez,” Nathan said. “I just went on and on. And you probably have so many other players to talk to. Why don&#39;t we do a speed round? Deal?”<br><br> Someone in front asked, “What was it like to get your first hit?”<br><br> “If you remember,” Nathan said, “I fouled off the first two pitches. And fouling a ball off is like every mistake you make in life: You put everything you&#39;ve got into a task, and if it&#39;s just a little wrong, it&#39;s wrong enough to make the whole effort a waste of time. The ball goes nowhere, or worse than nowhere. But when the barrel of the wooden bat hits the ball just so—you feel nothing. There&#39;s no resistance. Nothing at all. The ball leaps into the sky. The struggle is gone.”<br><br> Marco edged in. “Nathan, the average spin rate of your four-seamer is solid, at 2320, putting you ninth among middle relievers, but tonight, your average for the last three batters was 2090. Do you have a plan to address that?”<br><br> As Marco talked, Nathan&#39;s face slackened, his eyes glazed, and when Marco was finished, he said, “Honestly, Marco, I have no ever-loving idea.”<br><br> A balding man in a baby-blue sweat suit raised his hand. It was Tom Verlo, from the <i>LA Times</i> . He&#39;d likely come upstate to throw a bit of cold water on San Francisco&#39;s new attraction.<br><br> “Can you tell us about running?”他问。 “You looked a bit rusty.”<br><br> “Was it as bad as I&#39;m thinking it was?” Nathan said, and flashed an enormous and spectacularly awkward smile. “You know, as natural as it was when I hit that ball, running was the opposite. I felt like I was running in 1,000-year-old armor. By the time I got to second, the ball was in the second baseman&#39;s glove. He was waiting for me like a groom would a bride. When he tagged me out, I was so relieved, I wanted to fall into his arms.”<br><br> Tom smiled. “On the broadcast, it looked like he said something to you.”<br><br> “He did. He said, &#39; <i>Mijo</i> , now you can rest.&#39; ” Nathan looked at the clock on the wall. “We should hurry. Superspeed round now.”<br><br> “What does it sound like when a ball is caught?” a young web reporter asked.<br><br> “When I was a kid in Alabama, my grandfather lived in the backyard, in a little cottage. Every night after dinner, I would walk back to his place with him, and he would kiss me on the crown of my head and say, &#39;Adieu.&#39; Then he would close the door, and the sound of his door closing would be a muffled, wet, and decisive click. That&#39;s what it sounds like when a ball is caught. Like the click of the door to my grandfather&#39;s home.”<br><br> Nathan looked at the clock. “Okay, one last one? I see you, Lionel.”<br><br> Lionel, standing in the back, was happy for Nathan, and for the moment felt unnecessary. He shook his head.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">That was the game,</span> and the interview, that broke Nathan Couture into the national media. The next day, and for the following week, he was everywhere. ESPN did a segment, and Jimmy Kimmel had him on his show. With Sydney offering Nathan freely to all, the only thing Lionel could do was go to Phoenix.<br><br> Nathan&#39;s parents, though they&#39;d raised Nathan in Alabama, had moved to Arizona, and Warren green-lit a longer profile. In a stolen moment before a game, Lionel told Nathan he was thinking of going, and Nathan gave his blessing. “I trust you,” he said.<br><br> “Thank you,” Lionel said.<br><br> “You report accurately and you listen carefully,” he said.<br><br> “I try,” Lionel said.<br><br> “They are tremendous people,” Nathan said. “Immeasurably charming. You&#39;ll love them, and they you. I&#39;m envious that you get to see them. I&#39;ll call ahead and let them know I vouch for you.”<br><br> Lionel arrived at a comfortable ranch house 20 minutes from downtown Phoenix. A pickup truck was out front, and next to it, a small fishing boat rested on a trailer. Lionel rang the bell, and when the door opened, a thin couple in their late 60s stood before him, arms around each other&#39;s waists. Jim and Dot, short for Dorothy.<br><br> “Lionel,” Jim said.<br><br> “I took the liberty of pouring you a glass of ice water,” Dot said.<br><br> Lionel followed them in. He walked on the side of his left foot, but the squeaking was clearly audible. Lionel guessed, correctly, that they would be too polite to mention it.<br><br> “Come sit,” Jim said, and indicated a plush leather recliner in the living room. It was almost surely Jim&#39;s TV chair, and Lionel took the honor given. Nathan&#39;s parents sat to his right, on a matching couch.<br><br> “Nathan speaks highly of you,” Dot said.<br><br> “He does,” Jim agreed.<br><br> Lionel got his notebook out and looked around the room. He&#39;d expected a house full of books, but saw few. There were no trophies, either—no shrine to their son, the professional baseball player. An enormous TV dominated one wall. Next to it were two photos, from middle school, he guessed. One was clearly Nathan. The other was a girl, younger by a year or two, who shared a version of Nathan&#39;s goofy smile. But there was something knowing, even sardonic, in her eyes.<br><br> “So how does it feel,” Lionel asked, “with Nathan becoming this …” He almost said “curiosity” but instead chose “phenomenon.”<br><br> “Oh, it&#39;s been so nice,” Dot said.<br><br> “He worked hard,” Jim said. “Deserves it.”<br><br> Lionel smiled, thinking they were warming up. But they were done. Dot held her glass of water with two hands and smiled at Lionel in a motherly way. Lionel looked down at his notebook.<br><br> “So outside his skill as a pitcher,” he said, “one of the things that&#39;s gotten Nathan noticed is his way with words. Was he always loquacious?”<br><br> Dot winced. She looked to Jim. Jim chewed his cheek.<br><br> “I read your first article,” Dot said. “When you had him saying &#39;Indeed,&#39; right away I thought, <i>That&#39;s the comebacker</i> .” She pointed to her temple.<br><br> “He was never, you know, book smart,” Jim added. “That was his sister.”<br><br> “Never read a book unless you tied him down,” Dot said.<br><br> “He didn&#39;t talk a whole lot,” Jim said, “and when he did, he did it in a regular way. He was all laser-focused. That&#39;s how his coaches described him.”<br><br> “Single-minded. Then the comebacker happened,” Dot said.<br><br> “I&#39;m sorry. The comebacker?” Lionel asked.<br><br> “Well, he was hit by a comebacker,” Jim said, sounding surprised that Lionel didn&#39;t know. “In Sacramento. It was on the radio up there.”<br><br> “We were at the game,” Dot said. “It was awful. Nathan threw a fastball to a very big guy, I think he was from Nevada, and this guy hit the ball right back at him a million miles an hour. Hit him right here.” Again she pointed to her temple.<br><br> “From our angle, it looked awful,” Jim amended. “But later we saw it on tape, and it was more of a … It sorta grazed his head. The doctor checked him out and said he was okay. Nathan felt okay too. He pitched the rest of the inning and did fine. But then he took us out for dinner afterward, and it was like talking to some other person.”<br><br> “He had a $10 word for everything,” Jim said. “He said the wine was &#39;unafraid.&#39; I remember that. The wine was &#39;unafraid.&#39; That was new.”<br><br> “He did say that. He said a lot of things,” Dot said.<br><br> “He talked a lot that night,” Jim added. “We flew home the next morning, and a few days later, he gets called up to the Giants. Which is when you met him.”<br><br> “We figured the new way of talking was some temporary thing,” Dot said. “But then your article comes out, and he&#39;s still talking this way—&#39;indeed&#39; this and &#39;glorious&#39; that.”<br><br> “His sister talked like that. She was the reader.”<br><br> Lionel was afraid to ask.<br><br> “She passed young,” Dot said, and leaned forward, her hands on her knees. “It was a tumor. When they found it, it was too big.”<br><br> Jim cleared his throat. “Anyway. With Nathan, when he was talking like that, we put it together. It had to be the comebacker.”<br><br> Dot was nodding steadily, her eyes locked on Lionel. “Like something got knocked loose, and whatever was clogged up in there came pouring out. Sometimes people get hit in the head and start speaking another language.”<br><br> Jim nodded enthusiastically. “French, Portuguese, Turkish. But it seems like it&#39;s usually French.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">By the time</span> Lionel left, the impossible heat of paved Arizona had relented. He drove with the windows open, the red sunset behind him. He got back to the hotel and checked his messages. One was from Hannah.<br><br> “Sorry about your boy,” she said. “You probably know more than I do. Call if you want to compare notes.”<br><br> Lionel looked online and found a short blip about it. Nathan had been pitching in Cleveland when he blew out his arm. He left the park in a sling.<br><br> The professional thing for Lionel to do would be to return to Nathan&#39;s parents&#39; home and get their reaction. But he couldn&#39;t bring himself to bother them, and was so shattered that he sat on the bed and stared at the wall for the better part of an hour. Finally he got to his feet and drove his rental car to the airport.<br><br> Back in San Francisco, Lionel waited for news. For two days Nathan wasn&#39;t at the park, and no one had updates. Finally a press conference was called.<br><br> “How can a sequoia withstand a thousand years of earthquakes and fires and wind, and finally, one day, it just falls?”<br><br> The room was full. Lionel sat at the back. The team doctor came out and said they&#39;d done an MRI and consulted with the best specialists in the city. Nathan would need surgery, and even after that, the prognosis was not good. “I can&#39;t promise anything,” the doctor said.<br><br> And then Nathan walked in, wearing a coat and tie, his arm in a sling. He sat down. He looked warmly out at the throng of reporters, but before he could begin, Tom from the <i>LA Times</i> walked in late. “What&#39;s the prognosis?”他问。<br><br> The room groaned, but as always, Nathan treated the question with great decorum.<br><br> “If I were still 18,” he said, “I might be able to get the surgery. Then, in 10 or 12 months, I could return, though with reduced capacity. But I&#39;m almost 30, so there is no way back. Even if I did every last thing right, I&#39;d be, at best, a single-A player. And an old one at that.”<br><br> Hannah was in the front row. She raised her hand.<br><br> “Hi, Hannah,” Nathan said. “I&#39;m guessing you&#39;d like to know how it feels?”<br><br> She laughed and lowered her hand.<br><br> “It&#39;s a good question. At the moment, I&#39;m still stunned. Numb. I have to admit my imagination had gotten away from me, and I saw great glory ahead. I was looking forward to the rest of the season, to seasons to come, to the lights, all those people sitting 200 feet in the sky to watch this game. It&#39;s over sooner than I expected, for sure. So for the moment, I&#39;m adrift. Don&#39;t you cry now, Hannah.” He looked around the table for tissues. “All we have up here is water. Here,” he said, and poured her a tall glass from the pitcher. And as he did, time slowed. Every reporter in the room watched closely, as if they&#39;d never before seen water move from one vessel to another.<br><br> Nathan sat down again, and called on Lionel.<br><br> “Did you have any warning?” Lionel asked.<br><br> “You know, my friend, I really didn&#39;t. I felt good that day in Cleveland. But it&#39;s probably like any other thing. How can a sequoia withstand a thousand years of earthquakes and fires and wind, and finally, one day, it just falls? One afternoon, a gust comes and it gives up.” Nathan stood. “I&#39;ll miss you all. Hope I see you here or there or somewhere in between. Goodbye now.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Lionel walked</span> onto King Street, trying to figure out how to shape the story, or if he should bother. He still hadn&#39;t written about his time with Nathan&#39;s parents; his heart wasn&#39;t in it. When he turned the corner at Third Street, heading home, he felt a presence next to him.<br><br> “Caught up to you!” It was Nathan, out of breath. “I tried to find you at the park, and then was wandering around the neighborhood, hoping to run into you. I know you live around here. Then I heard the squeaking.”<br><br> They ducked into a burrito place. Lionel tried to order margaritas for them both, but Nathan declined. “I don&#39;t know why my mind is working the way it does now, but I don&#39;t want to mess with it.” He ordered a lemonade.<br><br> It was criminal to sit in that park, Lionel thought, with all that color, all that vaulting joy in a world of sadness and misfortune, and not do better.<br><br> Lionel ordered a lemonade too, and they sat by the window facing the park. “Your parents told me about the comebacker,” he said.<br><br> “Yeah, I figured,” Nathan said. “Funny thing is, I don&#39;t feel different, and I don&#39;t see differently than I ever did before. I&#39;ve always noticed the same things, but I guess that now I have the need, and maybe the words, to describe it.<br><br> “My sister was the eloquent one,” he continued after a pause. “My parents mention her?”<br><br> “A little bit,” Lionel said.<br><br> For a second Nathan smiled, as if thinking of her, of something she&#39;d said. “Anyway,” he said, “I&#39;ll be reading you, making sure you get it right.”<br><br> “I can do better,” Lionel said suddenly, and Nathan did not argue the point. It was criminal to sit in that park, Lionel thought, with all that color, all that vaulting joy in a world of sadness and misfortune, and not do better.<br><br> “You plan to fix the squeak?” Nathan asked.<br><br> “I took it back to the shoe guy,” Lionel said, “but he freed himself of any responsibility.”<br><br> “Can I?” Nathan asked, and Lionel took off his shoe and handed it to Nathan.<br><br> “It has to be an air pocket, right?” Nathan said. Even with one bum arm, he quickly found the pocket and aimed a fork at it. “Can I?” he asked again. Lionel nodded, and Nathan jabbed a strategic hole. “Try it now.”<br><br> Lionel put the shoe back on and walked a few steps. The squeak was gone. His relief was immeasurable. “Thank you,” he said.<br><br> They finished their lemonades and stepped back into the city. The lights were on in the stadium. Lionel had forgotten there was a home game that night. He turned to Nathan, thinking he&#39;d be wistful, but his eyes were sharp and happy.<br><br> “So what will you do now?” Lionel asked.<br><br> “I&#39;ve been thinking about that. Are you walking this way?” Nathan was heading toward the water, his gait loose. Lionel followed.<br><br> “Maybe you buy that Romanian shoemaker out.”<br><br> Nathan laughed. “You know,” he said, “a few years ago, I was in a high-rise in Guangzhou, visiting a friend at his office. Long story. But anyway, this was 42 floors up, and there was a man outside, cleaning the windows. He had one of those wide T-shaped tools for cleaning the glass—like a blade. You know the tool.很简单。 He drenched the window with soap, applying it with such liberality. Just soaked this vast window overlooking this limitless city.”<br><br> Nathan turned to the towers of downtown San Francisco.<br><br> “And then, with the T-shaped blade, he slashed the surface of the glass with the precision and finality of a guillotine. He got every last white sud. As we watched, the view through the window went from muddy to crystalline.”<br><br> Lionel couldn&#39;t figure out what the connection was. Nathan wanted to be a businessman in a Chinese high-rise? And how had this minor-league pitcher from Alabama ended up with a friend in Guangzhou?<br><br> “So I thought I&#39;d like to do that job,” Nathan said. He meant cleaning the windows. “Not necessarily in Guangzhou, and not forever, but I&#39;d like to try that for a while. I like being outside.”<br><br> They&#39;d arrived at the water, and Lionel thought he should get back to the ballpark. He reached out to shake Nathan&#39;s hand. Nathan lowered his sling and took Lionel&#39;s fingers in his.<br><br> “Or babies!” he said, still pumping Lionel&#39;s hand. “You know how after babies are born in hospitals, there are nurses who hold the babies while the moms recover from the birth?

Danya Perry 告诉我。她说，阿维纳蒂被关进了关押墨西哥毒枭“矮子”的同一间牢房。 （阿文纳蒂后来<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/13/nyregion/michael-avenatti-trump-jail.html">声称</a>，他的治疗是时任司法部长比尔·巴尔下令偿还的；监狱长<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/12/22/michael-avenatti-rise-and-fall-house-arrest-profile-525301">表示</a>，他被单独监禁是因为“严重担心”他的安全，而巴尔称阿文纳蒂的指控“荒谬”。）<br><br>然而，斯通和阿维纳蒂都不像特朗普那么引人注目，特朗普可以说是美国历史上最著名的联邦被告。佩里怀疑楚特坎会在审判前监禁他。多年来，特朗普无视负责监督针对他提起的各种民事案件的法官的警告，并且从未面临过切实的后果。佩里说：“他已经完成了很多次，并且成功滑冰了很多次，这让他更加有勇气。”<br><br>事实上，特朗普还暗示他将无视楚特坎的禁言令。 “我会谈谈它。我会。他们没有剥夺我的第一修正案权利，”特朗普周三在新罕布什尔州的竞选集会上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/08/trump-on-possible-gag-order-pound-sand-00110357">说</a>。<br><br>特朗普诽谤检察官并再次将自己描绘成政治迫害的受害者，其政治动机很明显：他试图激怒他的共和党基础。特朗普在有关审判的公开声明中似乎也在执行某种法律策略。他称华盛顿特区为“肮脏且犯罪猖獗的尴尬之地”，可能是因为这些言论将迫使法院同意他的请求，将审判转移到潜在陪审员群体更友善的地点，例如西弗吉尼亚州。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/">大卫·A·格雷厄姆：特朗普的表现就像他被逼到了绝境</a><br><br>据我采访的前检察官称，这种做法不太可能奏效。 “如果看到这一举措取得成功，我会感到震惊，”前联邦检察官、华盛顿反腐败倡导组织公民责任与道德组织的负责人诺亚·布克宾德 (Noah Bookbinder) 告诉我。 “这有点像一个老笑话，说的是一个孩子杀死了他的父母，然后因为他是孤儿而请求宽恕。我只是不认为法庭会这么做。”<br><br>特朗普的攻击也给特别检察官史密斯带来了问题。一方面，检察官显然有兴趣确保证人不会感到受到威胁；另一方面，史密斯可能觉得试图让特朗普保持沉默会助长这位前总统的受害者叙事。司法部检察官提醒查特坎注意特朗普在法庭文件中发表的“我正在追捕你”的帖子，在今天的听证会上，他们表示担心，如果不加以限制，特朗普可能会披露有利于他的竞选活动的证据。 （特朗普的一位发言人表示，前总统的警告是“政治言论的定义”，并且提到了反对他的候选资格的“特殊利益集团和超级政治行动委员会”。）但史密斯的团队并没有要求查特坎完全堵住特朗普的嘴，甚至警告他他。 “你看到检察官非常非常克制，”布克宾德说。 “很多被告都在说检察官和证人的坏话，他们会立即进去要求被告停止这样做。”<br><br>布克宾德将特朗普帖子的引用描述为政府的“回击”，这表明他们正在密切关注这位前总统的公开声明。但和查特坎一样，史密斯可能不愿意将此事推得太远。布克宾德指出，与特朗普就禁言令展开争执可能会分散政府想要将案件重点放在特朗普涉嫌犯罪上的注意力，并且可能会满足他拖延审判的愿望。但特别检察官必须权衡这些担忧与失控的被告可能危及检察官和证人安全的可能性。 “我强烈怀疑杰克·史密斯不想去那里，”布克宾德说。 “我认为在某些时候他可能别无选择。”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 11 Aug 2023 17:38:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊插图。资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure>拉达·帕特尔（Radha Patel）<span class="smallcaps">在马里兰州长大</span>，她没有看到她所在地区的任何人使用媒人。 But she was aware that in India, where her parents had emigrated from, plenty of couples were fixed up—by relatives, respected elders, women in the community trusted to intuit good pairs.不知为何，这个念头一直在她的脑海里挥之不去。 2018 年这种情况依然存在，当时朋友们对约会应用程序感到沮丧，开始寻求帮助寻找爱情。 “我不是技术人员，”她想。 “我能做些什么？”然后她意识到<em>自己</em>可以扮演媒人。<br><br>她开始介绍人，这变成了一种爱好，并于当年晚些时候变成了一项生意，《Single to Shaadi》。 2020 年，Netflix 热门节目<em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/08/netflix-indian-matchmaking-and-the-shadow-of-caste/614863/">《印度婚介》</a></em> （讲述了来自孟买的职业丘比特的故事）播出后，她和她认识的许多媒人迎来了一波新客户。冠状病毒大流行可能是导致病例激增的原因之一；尤其是在早期，很多人不想进行不必要的面对面约会。也许他们还意识到，他们的时间太宝贵了，不能浪费在约会应用上毫无结果的刷卡上。 Patel 表示，从 2019 年到 2020 年，Single to Shaadi 的活跃客户数量翻了一番，第二年又翻了一番。<br><br>该领域仍然有动力。过去几年里，新的婚介公司<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/04/tired-of-swiping-left-singles-turn-to-new-matchmaking-services-.html">不断</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/27/style/what-its-like-to-work-with-a-matchmaker.html">推出</a>，我采访过的婚介者告诉我，他们最近的兴趣有所上升。一些约会网站也试图利用这一趋势。 2021 年，拥有 Tinder、Hinge 和其他几款约会应用程序的巨头公司 Match Group 在 Match.com 上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/match-introduces-a-human-matchmaking-element-to-its-dating-app-11637269774">推出了</a>一项功能，通过该功能，真人教练每周为愿意每周支付 4.99 美元的每位会员推荐两份个人资料。今年早些时候，Netflix 推出了一部衍生剧： <em>《犹太婚介》</em> 。<br><br>这一历史传统的某些方面似乎与当代社会很好地契合。在约会应用程序让用户对自己的浪漫生活拥有令人难以置信的控制权的时代，对于某些人来说，让别人来掌控方向盘似乎越来越有吸引力。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">在世界各地的社会中</span>，人们都向第三方寻求合作伙伴。在犹太社区，几千年来，学者和拉比等值得信赖的人物充当了<em>媒人</em>的角色。在日本，传统上会招募一位“<em>中间人</em>”来推荐浪漫的候选人。历史上，韩国家庭会拜访<em>中美</em>以寻求配对，而在中世纪的天主教社会中，乡村牧师有时也会发挥作用。在所有这些习俗和许多其他习俗中，媒人通常为符合条件的年轻人的父母工作。家庭，而不仅仅是个人，都被联系在一起。 <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/labor-of-love-the-invention-of-dating-moira-weigel/9780374536954?affiliate_id=atl-347">《爱的劳动：约会的发明》一书</a></em>的作者莫伊拉·韦格尔告诉我，至少在工业革命之前，许多文化中的婚姻通常都与农业有关：将家庭团结起来，分担农业劳动，并确保下一代能够继续下去。那个工作。<br><br>但韦格尔告诉我，从 19 世纪左右开始，工业化使许多家庭不再需要这种结合；爱情成为更普遍的理想。尽管相亲在许多文化中仍然很流行，但在许多其他文化中，寻找浪漫已成为一种更加个人化的追求。人们仍然得到一些非正式的帮助；朋友和家人可能会尝试为单身人士牵线搭桥，无论他们欢迎与否。但随后出现了约会应用程序——这是一种特别孤独的求爱形式。<br><br>网上约会不仅会让人感到孤独，而且还非常耗时。梳理这些应用程序感觉就像是一份兼职工作。 2016 年，Hinge <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/soloish/wp/2016/10/03/why-is-the-dating-app-hinge-bashing-swipe-apps/">报告称</a>，该应用程序上的滑动次数只有五分之一会导致电话号码被交换。同年，当该公司对其 300 名用户进行调查时，发现<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thedatingapocalypse.com/stats/">其中 81% 的用户</a>从未在任何基于滑动的约会应用程序上找到过长期关系。 2018年，约会公司Badoo对英国5000名18至30岁的人<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/dating-apps-millenials-10-hours-per-week-tinder-bumble-romance-love-a8174006.html">进行调查</a>时发现，用户平均每周在约会应用上花费10个小时。<br><br>所有这些工作都让约会者在爱情生活中比以前有更多的代理权。他们不需要等待一次偶然的邂逅，甚至不需要离开家。他们可以随时滑动、发送消息、约人见面。但这种控制感对许多人来说是一种祝福，也可能是一种负担——尤其是当你同时与几个追求者交谈时，这在应用程序中很常见。帕特尔称之为“DIY约会”：所有的分析和过度思考都涉及到——“<em>什么不起作用？什么是对的？</em> ……<em>我在消息之间等待的时间是否太长？电话那头的那个人是真的吗？</em> ——这一切都得你自己做。”<br><br>那么，难怪媒人会很高兴。许多有能力外包约会劳动力的人都渴望这样做。婚介服务的成本可能非常昂贵：虽然有些公司可能会承诺以几百美元的价格提供几次匹配，但许多公司会收取数千甚至数十万的费用，以获得为期 6 至 12 个月的会员资格或少数有保证的日期。但他们宣传的是一个细致的流程，专家根据客户的兴趣、价值观和对过去关系的评估，有条不紊地缩小大量候选人的范围。人们不会倾向于使用媒人，除非他们正在寻求长期承诺，因此客户可以非常有信心，他们不会在令人困惑的情况或歪曲的意图上浪费时间。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/04/couples-dating-defining-the-relationship-status-uncertainty/673650/">阅读：关系中最可怕的部分</a><br><br>媒人还可以在整个非常脆弱的约会过程中充当向导。为一个热情、令人安慰且……人性化的中介人进行算法交易可能很有吸引力。与应用程序不同的是，许多媒人会就如何寻找伴侣、如何展现自己、何时再给某人一次机会、甚至某人在人际关系中可能出问题的地方等方面提供建议。当婚介公司 Selective Search 让我联系他们的客户 Connie Weaver（一家人寿保险公司的首席营销官）时，我听说了这件事。她告诉我，在她的丈夫于 2020 年去世之前，她已经结婚三十多年了。当她在 60 多岁时再次开始约会时，她不知道自己想要什么，也不知道如何去寻找它。她是一位成功的高管和人际交往能力，擅长在任何商务会议上进行对话。 “但这并不意味着 35 年后，”她告诉我，“我在这方面很擅长。”在选择性搜索中，“有人拉着我的手给我信心，”她说。<br><br>韦弗的第二场比赛是她可能不会直接滑动的人，如果他们是在应用程序上的话。她不想和医学界的任何人约会——他的领域。 （她有过糟糕的经历。）但她决定对这个过程充满信心。 “你必须相信他们会从你身上吸引出<em>真正的你</em>，”她告诉我。四个月后，韦弗仍然见到他；虽然很新，但感觉很特别。 “我高兴极了，”她告诉我。 “每个人都说我容光焕发。而且我已经很久没有发光了。”<br><br>对于在约会世界中挣扎的人们来说，经验丰富的化学专业人士可以发现你内心深处隐藏的品质，并利用它们引导你找到你可能错过的人，这个想法可能非常诱人。但为了让媒人做到这一点，他们可能需要了解客户告诉他们的内容之外的内容。西北大学研究浪漫吸引力的心理学家伊莱·芬克尔告诉我，人类往往不太擅长推断我们自己想要什么。在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-00466-005">一些</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51251730_When_and_why_do_ideal_partner_preferences_affect_the_process_of_initiating_and_maintaining_close_relationships">研究</a>中，研究人员询问参与者他们在寻找什么样的伴侣，结果发现他们的答案并不能预测他们真正喜欢的人类型。无论如何，人们往往会被相同的品质所吸引。如果你正在寻找一个有吸引力的、友善的、有趣的人，那么你并不完全是独一无二的。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/helen-fisher-science-online-dating-apps-tinder/672419/">阅读：让网上约会成为一门“科学”的女人</a><br><br>即使媒人试图不相信客户的话，芬克尔也认为提前预测兼容性本质上是一场艰苦的战斗。 “很多让我们与人相处融洽的因素都是<em>自然而然出现的</em>，”他告诉我。 “也就是说，它是在我们相遇<em>之后</em>才开始存在的。”即便如此，化学仍然是复杂而神秘的，并且部分取决于运气。他举了一个例子：也许约会时一个人说他们来自阿肯色州，另一个人说，<em>哦！这次公路旅行我去了阿肯色州，去了约瑟夫母亲熟食店。你到过那里吗？</em>晚上的进展情况可能部分取决于这个问题的答案，因为<em>“是”</em>和<em>“否”</em>会让谈话转向不同的方向。也许两个人都去过那里，他们交换意见，这会引发笑声，引发内部笑话，感觉就像火花一样。<br><br>但爱情的谜团也是媒人魅力的一部分。如果你自己没有答案，你至少可以希望别人能找到答案。韦弗告诉我，她认为相亲既是“一门艺术，也是一门科学”。一方面，令人欣慰的是存在可以破解的兼容性代码。另一方面，我们不希望浪漫过于临床，纯粹从几次采访或详细的调查问卷中推断出来。米哈尔·奈斯特 (Michal Naisteter) 是费城的一名媒人，也是播客<em>The Yentas</em>的联合主持人，他告诉我，这就是人们向她寻求帮助的部分原因，而且通常是向人类而不是算法寻求帮助。 “这个过程有些是神奇的，”她告诉我。 “这有点宇宙性。”<br><br>这就是现代的浪漫之道：人们需要效率，但也需要人性。他们想要独立，而不是依赖家庭，但他们仍然需要指导；他们想要选择，而不是仅仅从该地区的少数追求者中进行选择，但他们不想花几个小时来筛选他们。当代婚介是人类在爱情方面相互对立的冲动的支点：它试图平衡现代性和传统，将劳动力外包，并在不剥夺人们自主权的情况下，在孤独的约会世界中为人们提供一个盟友。<br><br>帕特尔只是众多试图向客户展示他们可以拥有这一切的媒人之一。她给她的公司起了一个口号：“不是你父母的媒人”，并且她对自己的流程进行了现代化改造：她不会根据种姓进行匹配。她强调与不同宗教以及不同性取向的人一起工作。 Single to Shaadi 不与客户的父母合作（尽管帕特尔还有另一家更以家庭为导向的婚介公司），帕特尔试图让她的服务相对实惠——起价略高于 100 美元——这样年轻的单身人士就可以在不涉及他们的情况下支付费用。家庭。这看起来和她从小到大听到的相亲有点不同，但也不是无法辨认。她还没有摆脱基本的福利：不需要确切知道自己想要什么的天赋，因为你不是独自做决定。<br><br><em><small>当您使用此页面上的链接购买书籍时，我们会收到佣金。感谢您对</small></em><small>大西洋月刊</small>的支持<em><small>。</small></em><br><br></div>

Threads 这样的新网站，还是想从 F​​acebook 这样的老网站中获得更多信息，这里都有一些关于如何在不使用社交媒体的情况下使用社交媒体的提示。<br><br><strong>举办一场街区派对。</strong><br><br>在现实生活中，如果有人闯入一群陌生人的聚会并开始大声辱骂并扰乱谈话，他们很快就会被赶出聚会。然而在社交媒体上，这种刻薄的​​行为不仅被容忍，有时甚至受到赞扬。在我们的日常生活中，对不当行为进行纪律处分是我们学习变得更好的方法。但由于这些规范在互联网上从未得到维护，许多空间变得有毒，许多人从未得到改掉坏习惯所需的反馈。阻止是反馈的一部分。当人们意识到如果以某种方式表达自己的意见就不会被听到时，他们就会停下来。即使他们不这样做，您也没有义务适应他们。您的社交媒体动态就是您的聚会，您可以决定宾客名单。这样做，你并不是脸皮薄，而是脸皮薄。您是一位尽职尽责、营造良好氛围的主人。<br><br><strong>正确地阅读房间。</strong><br><br> “阅读房间”的警告是社交媒体上最懒惰的反驳之一。对于那些理智上不严肃的人来说，这是一种通过示意想象中观众的反应来驳回争论而不涉及其实质内容的方式。但这个概念包含着真理的核心。在社交媒体上，我们都在不同的房间里工作，说话时会想到不同的人。许多在线冲突都是由交叉线造成的，当针对一种情况的对话（对志同道合的人来说是一个讽刺性的笑话）渗透到另一种情况（在不理解这个笑话的人之间）时。但这个问题有一个简单的解决办法：在发布内容之前，问问自己这是否是适合您要说的内容的平台。<br><br>有些声明是针对群聊的，而不是针对整个互联网的。其他人则受益于尽可能广泛的听证会。想要电视或旅游推荐吗？问问 Twitter 或 Facebook 的蜂巢思维。想分享您的风景假期吗？ Instagram 吧。想要讨论敏感的个人事务或解决棘手的政治问题吗？在聊天中与您的朋友联系，或者只是向值得信赖的知己发送私人消息。如果做得好，阅读房间不应该阻止你说出你想说的话，而是帮助你说出可以真正被听到的事情。<br><br> <a

Rosenberg：如何重新控制您在互联网上阅读的内容</a><br><br><strong>不要使用社交媒体作为公众舆论的代理。</strong><br><br>正是因为不同的平台有不同的用处，所以吸引了不同类型的人群和话语。这意味着这些网站并不能很好地反映民众情绪。举个例子，皮尤研究中心<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/">发现</a>，只有 23% 的美国成年人使用 Twitter（该网站现在被称为 X），而<a data-event-element="inline link"

的成年人。这没有什么问题。一般来说，每个社交媒体网站都服务于自己的利基市场和社区。当人们试图将这些平台当作他们不具有代表性的公众样本时，问题就出现了。这往往会导致对我们的世界做出<a data-event-element="inline link"

等网站往往会优先考虑最响亮、最有趣或最粗鲁的声音，而不一定是最明智或最友善的声音。此外，与大多数新技术一样，社交媒体平台的用户群<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/">偏向年轻人</a>，这意味着人们不太可能听到老年人的观点和经历。 （这就是为什么像乔·拜登这样的政治候选人往往在社交媒体上表现不佳，但在投票箱上表现更好的原因之一。）在采用新平台和使用旧平台时，我们应该牢记它们的局限性，而不是不加批判地允许流行的内容他们影响整个公司或国家的进程。<br><br><strong>抵制愤怒的诱饵。</strong><br><br> “推特的棘手之处在于：你看到人们对不公正现象有多么愤怒，你会说‘哦，这是一个很棒的地方’，但当你再滚动一点时，关于苹果酱的对话同样愤怒，你开始思考也许这毕竟不是那么好。”视频游戏主播斯蒂芬·弗拉瓦尔 (Stephen Flavall) 在 2020 年的 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/JoINrbs/status/1286131058266632192">观察</a>完美地捕捉到了社交媒体在愤怒和其他方面的运行方式，以至于似乎所有在线亚文化最终都会被最愤怒、最反对的版本所取代。这是有原因的：愤怒会传播。<br><br> 2021 年，剑桥大学和纽约大学的研究人员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2024292118">发现</a>，关于一个人的意识形态对手的推文比关于其政治盟友的推文更有可能被分享，也更有可能引起愤怒的反应。换句话说，事实证明，分歧比一致更能传播。与此同时，耶鲁大学的研究人员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/13/likes-and-shares-teach-people-express-more-outrage-online">发现</a>，愤怒帖子的点赞和分享会鼓励那些发帖者在未来发表更多愤怒的帖子。总而言之，这些研究说明了社交媒体如何创建一个反馈循环，在这个循环中，平台本身鼓励用户逐渐发布更多关于敌人的精神错乱的言论。获得奖励的行为会被重复。<br><br>

（其中一个甚至成为了总统。）但是有一个简单的方法可以摆脱这个陷阱：增强你喜欢的东西，忽略你不喜欢的东西。阻止不良行为者而不是与他们接触。这条规则可能有例外，但坚持将其作为默认规则将极大地改善您的在线体验，并阻止煽动性个人试图劫持我们的集体注意力。<br><br><strong>放下干草叉。</strong><br><br> 2020 年 6 月，彼得·温伯格 (Peter Weinberg) 登上 Twitter 热搜榜，多个平台上充斥着来自他从未见过的人的恶毒、斥责信息。这位49岁的人的家庭住址甚至被发布在网上。原因是：他在一段<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/nyccookies/status/1268640734254714883">病毒视频</a>中袭击了一名张贴支持乔治·弗洛伊德传单的女孩。但他不是。整个事件是业余网络侦探的身份错误所致。事发<em>第二天</em>，温伯格就在现场。他也不是这场驾车私刑正义的唯一受害者。正如<em>《纽约》</em>杂志<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/what-its-like-to-get-doxed-for-taking-a-bike-ride.html">报道的</a>那样，“另一名男子，前马里兰州警察，也受到了错误的指控。指责他的推文被转发并点赞超过 50 万次。”<br><br> Outrage mobs are perhaps the most pernicious manifestation of social media&#39;s pathologies.许多这样的进攻在目标选择上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://patch.com/illinois/chicago/trolls-wrongly-accused-retired-firefighter-capitol-riot-murder">都是</a><a data-event-element="inline link"

Twitter 这样的平台就没那么宽容了——它更像是一串意识形态香蕉皮摆在数百万陌生人面前。每天，网站上的某些内容或其许多后继者都会诱使我们发表超出我们专业知识的评论。但我们不必这样做。<br><br>这种克制不仅能让你避免尴尬，还能防止你对最新的突发新闻反应过度，而且当你有重要的事情要说时，它还能帮助你发挥作用。你在网上公开武断地谈论的话题越多，你就越有可能犯错，让人们有理由对你所说的其他内容打折扣。这并不意味着您不应该在互联网上直言不讳！但你应该将自己限制在你最希望被听到或影响别人的实际专业领域。你最不想看到的就是你对文化战争问题的即兴看法会损害你对真正重要的事情的深刻见解。这也是为什么依赖公众信任来传达信息的记者和学者应该坚持自己的节奏，而不是发布超出其范围的主题。如有疑问，请回忆一世纪拉比的智慧，他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.17?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en">说</a>：“我一生都是在圣贤中长大的，对于一个人来说，没有什么比沉默更好的了。”<br><br><strong>燃烧前请阅读。</strong><br><br>我们都做到了。我们被文章的标题、推文或屏幕截图激怒，分享了我们对某个故事的不满，但没有真正阅读相关文章，也没有弄清楚标题是否准确，或者摘录的引文的上下文是否改变了其含义。 Doing this may seem harmless in isolation, but in practice, it&#39;s not happening in isolation.如今，许多社交媒体用户认为，对他们没有真正消费过的内容做出判断是完全合理的，而这种波将金式的武断的集体积累会污染公共话语。<br><br>你的一年级老师说得对：不要以封面来判断一本书，或者，在这种情况下，不要以推文或标题来判断一个故事。自信地评论你懒得读的材料不仅是智力上的不诚实，而且是一种不诚实的行为。它告诉你的追随者你对他们的重视不够，无法阅读你与他们分享的内容，这是对他们的不尊重。它将社交媒体变成了一场闹剧，人们为想象中的争论而争论，但实际上没有人提出过。没有人能赢得这些辩论，也没有人变得更明智。现在是集体承诺结束这种做法的时候了，并在必要时呼吁那些参与这种做法的人。<br><br>哦，如果你在评论这里写的内容之前就已经到了这里：恭喜你。您已经是解决方案的一部分。现在请随意告诉我为什么我完全错了。<br><br></div>

href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/03/wisconsin-democrats-ben-wikler-00022556">全国最好的国家主席</a>”<span class="smallcaps">的人</span>并不是全国家喻户晓的人物。在他自己的州，他甚至不是家喻户晓的名字。但最近的一个下午，在威斯康星州格拉夫顿的一个小村庄，本·威克勒就像波诺一样。<br><br>两打中年和退休志愿者排队握住威斯康星州民主党主席的手。 “感谢你们所做的一切，”当威克勒在奥佐基县党总部绕了一圈时，他们微笑着对他说道。 “我们很高兴你在这里。”就像骄傲的孩子面对钦佩的父母一样，志愿者告诉他今年夏天他们筹集了多少钱以及敲开了多少扇门。<br><br> “这是康妮，”有人拍着一个女人的肩膀说道。 “她刚刚赢得了学校董事会的竞选。” “耶，学校董事会！”威克勒欢呼起来。<br><br>他在那里为一位威斯康星州议会候选人敲开最后一天的大门，这位候选人在纯红色的奥佐基县获胜的机会很小，奥佐基县是密尔沃基以北密歇根湖岸边的一个远郊地区。但重点不是赢，而是输得<i>少</i>。那天下午，威克勒成功地发表了一场演讲，其热情几乎与黑门阿拉贡一样鼓舞人心。他对志愿者们说：“这次选举向我们民主党人和整个国家表明，现在正在发生变化。”同时也提醒共和党人“民主党人没有放弃民主。”<br><br>自 2019 年担任主席以来，威克勒让他的政党在威斯康星州摆脱了事实上的无足轻重的局面。在唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 拆除中西部北部所谓的蓝墙四年后，威克勒 (Wikler) 的领导力帮助威斯康星州以及整个总统选举在 2020 年向民主党倾斜。然后，今年早些时候，威克勒 (Wikler) 筹集的数百万美元帮助了民主党一位进步的候选人在非周期州最高法院竞选中获胜，这可能会导致威斯康星州<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/voting-rights/2023/8/3/23818858/wisconsin-gerrymander-clarke-wisconsin-election-commision-supreme-court-janet-protasiewicz">严重不公正划分的地图</a>重新设计。<br><br>威克勒的才华在于让人们展现出来。他通过将每一次竞选都视为一生中的一次选举来做到这一点。他告诉我：“资源往往会流向那些可以发挥作用或激发他们的想象力的地方。”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/10/wisconsin-democrats-worried-about-2020-election/616894/">阅读：威斯康星州的事情还没有结束</a><br><br><i>资源</i>是一种委婉的说法。他真正指的是<i>美元</i>。由于共和党几年前通过的立法，威斯康星州是少数几个个人可以<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/who-were-the-50-largest-campaign-donors-to-wisconsin-political-parties-in-2022/">无限</a>量向政党捐款的州之一，而政党又可以无限量地向候选人转移资金。<b> </b>威克勒的天才之处在于他将筹款的武器转向了使其成为法律的政党。<br><br>在明年总统选举前夕，美国人的目光将再次集中在威克勒的家上。 “如果我们能在所有 50 个州都有本·威克勒 (Ben Wikler)，那么民主党的状况将会更好，”播客主播、前奥巴马演讲撰稿人乔恩·费儒 (Jon Favreau) 告诉我。但人们可能已经厌倦了事关生死存亡的选举，无论该党花多少钱说服他们出去投票。再次激发想象力，尤其是代表一位支持率不太高的年长现任议员，可能是威克勒迄今为止最艰巨的挑战。<br><br>我和 Wikler 的团队一起<span class="smallcaps">乘坐</span>他们租来的小型货车去参加奥佐基县的活动。当我滑开后门时，我发现党主席被扣在中间一排的座位上，他的头擦着天花板。 42 岁的 Wikler 留着山羊胡，身材高大（6 英尺 4 英寸），戴着透明框眼镜，穿着牛仔衬衫和牛仔裤。他看起来像布鲁克林的父亲，但威克勒是来自麦迪逊的父亲，他对此感到非常自豪。<br><br>我刚坐下来，威克勒就开始了一个 30 分钟的复习课程，为了我的利益，讲述威斯康星州独特的过去。罗伯特·拉福莱特和国家的社会主义根源。参议员乔·麦卡锡。汤米·汤普森州长的福利改革。接下来是最近的历史：2011 年斯科特·沃克 (Scott Walker) 就任州长，共和党成功推翻州议会两院。沃克第 10 号法案削弱了公共工会的权力。共和党<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/magazine/the-new-front-in-the-gerrymandering-wars-democracy-vs-math.html">颇具争议且秘密的选区重划计划</a>。<br><br> “你已经说过多少次这样的话了？”我问他什么时候完成。<br><br>他笑了。 “实际上还有一个扩展版本。”<br><br>如今，威克勒与妻子、三个孩子以及一只巨大而兴奋的伯尔尼山犬一起住在麦迪逊西区童年的家中。但在搬回中西部北部之前，威克勒是华盛顿特区进步组织 MoveOn 的主任，他领导了该组织的抗议活动，反对共和党试图推翻《平价医疗法案》。在此之前，威克勒在担任阿尔·弗兰肯的研究员和制片人一段时间后，主持了一个名为<i>“The Good Fight”</i>的政治播客。这位来自明尼苏达州的前参议员仍然是一位亲密的朋友。 “他非常聪明，非常有趣，而且是一位非常优秀的作家，”弗兰肯上个月在电话中告诉我威克勒。 “他拥有全套的条件，这很难成为州主席。” （弗兰肯说，弗兰肯 2003 年出版的书名《<i>谎言和告诉他们的说谎的骗子</i>》是威克勒的主意，弗兰肯说。）<br><br>然后，2016 年，特朗普冲破了蓝墙，自 1984 年罗纳德·里根以来首次为共和党赢得了威斯康星州的选举团票。这就是为什么威克勒最终决定搬回家乡，帮助重振共和党的命运。<br><br>作为主席，威克勒因在推特上发布有关威斯康星州选举的高潮帖子而闻名，这些帖子在网上疯传。他不断接受采访，传达竞选上下投票的紧迫性。威克勒告诉我，他担任主席期间的核心策略是“购买更大的警报器，并尽可能将其置于尽可能高的位置。”<br><br>美国大多数州政党大约有六名全职带薪工作人员，但威克勒将其工作人员从 30 人扩大到 70 人。<b> </b>他拥有全面的数字化运营、内部研究小组和全职青年组织者。<br><br>自 2019 年以来，威克勒利用他在国家政治中的关系筹集了超过 1.1 亿美元，这对于一个缔约国来说是一个惊人的高数额。他的团队最成功的筹款活动是让 Robin Wright 和 Julia Louis-Dreyfus 等名人关注獾州：2020 年 9 月，威斯康星州民主党举办了一场 Zoom 桌读会，宣读 1987 年的电影<i>《公主新娘》</i> ，这部影片将大部分成员重新聚集在一起。原来的演员阵容。该活动吸引了超过 10 万名观众并筹集了 425 万美元。于是他们又做了两次，分别是<i>《白宫风云》</i>和<i>《副总统》</i>的演员。<br><br>威斯康星州本可以走邻国爱荷华州的道路，后者在过去六年中急剧右转。在獾州，偏向民主党的趋势始于2018年，当时许多选民反抗特朗普。但在很大程度上要归功于威克勒建立的机器，该党在过去几个周期中继续在该州大都市区以越来越大的优势获胜，而在密尔沃基倾向共和党的郊区则以较小的优势输掉。 <i>《密尔沃基哨兵报》</i>退休华盛顿分社社长克雷格·吉尔伯特告诉我，尽管民主党在全国范围内一直在农村地区流失选民，但他们至少成功地止住了威斯康星州农村地区的选民流失。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/05/democrat-rob-sand-iowa-statewide-office/674109/">阅读：爱荷华州最危险的民主党人</a><br><br>事实证明，全州选举是民主党最有价值的战场。在威斯康星州，拜登在 2020 年以 2 万票击败特朗普，去年民主党州长托尼·埃弗斯以微弱优势赢得连任。唯一令人失望的是曼德拉·巴恩斯输给了现任共和党参议员罗恩·约翰逊。但就在去年春天，威斯康星州人选举珍妮特·普罗塔谢维奇进入州最高法院，这场竞选打破了投票率<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/voter-turnout-in-wisconsin-supreme-court-race-breaks-record/">记录</a>，并吸引了乔治·索罗斯、史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格和伊利诺伊州州长 JB·普利兹克的捐款。<br><br>威克勒作为民主党领导人的遗产将是该州捐助基础的国有化——他通过主张威斯康星州处于美国政治斗争的中心而实现了这一点。这是否有利于民主则是另一回事。<br><br>来自加利福尼亚州或伊利诺伊州的富有的民主党人进行了大量捐赠，但他们并不是普通威斯康星州人的理想替代者。 “选举不应该是少数右翼亿万富翁和少数左翼亿万富翁之间的拉锯战，”威斯康星州民主运动前执行董事马修·罗斯柴尔德告诉我。 “但是本没有进入竞争环境。威斯康星州的共和党人创造了竞争环境。美国最高法院创造了竞争环境。”<br><br><span class="smallcaps">如果威克勒的战略</span>是使威斯康星州的政治成为全国性的，那么他也致力于超本地化的竞选活动：威克勒认为，民主党应该在各地都有存在。这就是为什么这辆货车从格拉夫顿再向西行驶两个小时到达巴拉布，参加一年一度的农业设备博览会。<br><br>该缔约国的农村核心小组在农作物喷洒无人机展示区和研磨林产品示范区之间搭建了一个帐篷。威克勒向他的一些成员发表了鼓舞人心的讲话，然后大步走向索克县共和党人的帐篷。 “嗨，我是民主党主席，”他一边说，一边向三个在树荫下聊天的 60 多岁男人伸出了手。在几分钟的时间里，这四人有点尴尬地来回讨论前州长沃克的成功和失败，以及他们中是否有人对特朗普的第二次提名感到特别兴奋。 （他们没有。） 这一切都足够令人愉快。<br><br>然后，当威克勒转身离开时，其中一名男子把他拉到一边。 “我得告诉你一件事，”他低声说道。 “今天早上我在你的帐篷里和一位绅士谈过话，我从来没有遇到过比他更好的人，也没有进行过比他更合理的谈话。”威克勒笑容满面。 “作为党主席，听到这个消息我很高兴，”他回答道。<br><br>下午晚些时候，我们离开巴拉布，前往米德尔顿参加志愿者野餐，米德尔顿是门多塔湖沿岸绿树成荫的麦迪逊郊区。聚会是在一个郁郁葱葱的后院举行的，那里到处都是不守规矩的开花灌木和那种古怪的动物草坪装饰品，似乎在宣告，<i>一位民主党人住在这里！</i><br><br>院子里挤满了来自不同街区的上门小组的白发志愿者。 “我认为没有本我们什么也做不了，”活动主持人乔安娜·理查德告诉我。 “他的领导力至关重要：他的人脉关系，以及我们全年筹款和组织的方式。”几分钟后，威克勒发表了当天的第三次也是最后一次励志演讲，感谢人们在过去几年中所做的工作。他告诉他们，我们正在“建造比我们任何人都更大的东西”。 “你是这个项目的核心，是民主最关键的熔炉——关键引擎，网络的中心。”<br><br>共和党人正在为威斯康星州的反弹而努力。本月晚些时候，他们将在密尔沃基举办共和党总统初选的第一场辩论，共和党全国代表大会将于明年夏天在同一城市举行。这种全国性的关注对于该州来说是件好事，因为该党最近低估了民主党的支持率。<br><br> “他们非常擅长获得好莱坞的资金，”州共和党主席布赖恩·希明(Brian Schimming)在电话中告诉我，语气听起来既阴暗又嫉妒。 “It&#39;s hard to compete with” the Democrats&#39; celebrities and wealthy out-of-state donors, he said. “我需要将威斯康星州进一步国有化。”<br><br>这一次，共和党人肯定会更加关注筹款。 “如果本认为他或他的继任者总能赢得金钱竞赛，那他就是在自欺欺人，”罗斯柴尔德告诉我。但金钱并不是<i>这场</i>比赛最终最重要的因素。<br><br> “我宁愿遇到我的问题，也不愿遇到本的问题，因为本是一位非常不受欢迎的现任议员，”席明告诉我。 “我们的人们对这场比赛真的很兴奋。”<br><br>事实上，威克勒似乎确实有点紧张。 He worries about a low-turnout election—and that people aren&#39;t taking seriously enough the very real possibility of a second Trump presidency. “2020 年，人们准备不惜一切代价击败特朗普。我让人们提前退休并搬到威斯康星州做志愿者，”他在车上告诉我。 “现在这一切都没有发生。”<br><br> <a

moderates in the suburbs and the small cities around Green Bay.障碍已经很高了，拜登并没有让很多人热血沸腾。 “自 2020 年以来我一直担心这个问题，”费儒说。 “很容易看到一些人说，‘[拜登]太老了。我要回到特朗普。”更容易看到这样一种情况，一些威斯康星州人厌倦了这一切，干脆不投票。<br><br>在米德尔顿乔安娜·理查德的后院，威克勒正在结束他的鼓舞人心的演讲，有点气喘吁吁。他说，他们将“在今年全年、明年春天的地方选举中，以及 2024 年明年秋天”开展工作。 “然后我们将在六个月后的 2025 年地方选举中继续！下一场州最高法院竞选——”<br><br>一些人在这一点上发出了一声叹息，可能是期待着接下来两年疲惫不堪的敲门、电话银行和舔信封来捍卫民主。我旁边的一个男人喊道：“我们累了！”但这种动摇的热情只持续了几分之一秒，整个团队就开始大笑。<br><br>当然，他们累了。但对于威克勒来说，他们会出现。<br><br>其他人都会吗？<br><br></div>

class="smallcaps">any people say</span> they are looking for happiness. They spend a lot of time and resources searching for the secrets of well-being, like old-time miners prospecting for gold. But for some sages throughout history, this is the wrong approach. Happiness isn&#39;t something to be <i>found</i> ; it&#39;s something to <i>attract</i> .<br><br> Perhaps the most famous proponent of the second path was the Greek philosopher Aristotle. He defined happiness as <i>eudaemonia</i> , which means “good spirit.” To us moderns, this might sound vaporous, like the superficial happy feelings that so many people (incorrectly, in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/11/finding-happiness-and-meaning-in-politically-divided-america/672130/">my view</a> ) chase. Instead, the philosopher meant that happiness was a divine state that would visit each of us as it pleased. Our only responsibility was to open the door to it. And we do so by living well.<br><br> To live well, we should practice specific virtues and make them into habits. As Aristotle <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D1%3Achapter%3D9">wrote</a> in his <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> , “If it is better to be happy as a result of one&#39;s own exertions than by the gift of fortune, it is reasonable to suppose that this is how happiness is won.” Here are 10 of the virtues he recommends—which, as modern research shows, do generally attract the good spirit.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C.

Whether he would recognize the virtue in our modern settings is hard to guess—who knows what he would say about the fear of being canceled on social media? But the question at hand is not the source of fear but whether courage—to act in the face of fear rather than give in to it—invites happiness.

He would classify the hippie motto “If it feels good, do it!” as a recipe for misery. Modern researchers investigating self-control agree, but with a twist. Scholars writing in the <i>Journal of Personality</i> in 2017 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12322?casa_token=xFX0iDLDuiQAAAAA%3AfPL8aHFxVyoSerYzXI9M4aTRzOK-q_SMOPXPgMgGf9gzupRILN3uZvR-ZMakYB2hPOk1F9PnepszUL0">found</a> that as impulse control among college students increased over the course of a day, positive affect initially <i>fell</i> . As self-control kept rising, however, negative feelings decreased; happiness rose to its highest levels when self-control was at its highest as well. In other words, a little moderation isn&#39;t so good for well-being, but immoderate moderation may be great.<br><br> <b>3.</b><b> </b><b>Liberality</b><br> By this, the philosopher is referring not to politics (liberal <i>ism</i> ) but to money. Specifically, he recommends avoiding stinginess but without being profligate. In fact, evidence suggests that being a cheapskate influences your well-being. For example, three economists in 2014 set up an ultimatum-bargaining game in which participants had to split a certain amount of money: One participant offered a certain split; the other could say yes or no, but <i>no</i> meant that neither side got anything, so the offer of a lousy split could be answered with spite. The authors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108218">found</a> that physical stress levels were higher for both parties when the bargaining involved offered a split lower than 40 percent.<br><br> <b>4.</b><b> </b><b>Magnificence</b><br> Related to liberality is what Aristotle <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-nicomachean_ethics/1926/pb_LCL073.207.xml">calls</a> “magnificence,” according to which a person “will think how he can carry out his project most nobly and splendidly, rather than how much it will cost and how it can be done most cheaply.” He was not asserting here that the path to happiness is to buy an ostentatious yacht; rather, magnificence <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://philarchive.org/archive/ATHADO">means</a> giving to projects that benefit a large number of people. Today, we might call this “munificence”—to be as philanthropic as you reasonably can be. For this, the support is unambiguous: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.journalppw.com/index.php/jpsp/article/view/4535">Giving feels good</a> .<br><br> <b>5.</b><b> </b><b>Greatness of soul</b><br> A great-souled person, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0002.002/--modern-greatness-of-soul-in-hume-and-smith?rgn=main;view=fulltext">according</a> to Aristotle, acts like his close predecessor in ancient Greek philosophy, Socrates, who was a “being indifferent to good and bad fortune.” This requires being high-minded—not that you can&#39;t tell the difference between pleasant and unpleasant things, but that you are occupied by what is deeper and more meaningful in life than transitory pleasures and passing irritations.

The idea is that to be self-possessed in this way brings happiness. If true, then gentleness&#39;s opposite, aggression, should lower well-being by making it harder to manage one&#39;s own emotions. Researchers have tested this idea by asking people to think of someone they despise, and then either to imagine violent, malicious actions toward the person or to focus on a neutral thought (specifically, what they planned to do the following Wednesday—presumably <i>not</i> beat up the person in question). They <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260518812796?journalCode=jiva">found</a> that the aggressive thinkers began to brood over their fantasy assault and experienced lower well-being than the temperate crew as a result.<br><br> <b>7.</b><b> </b><b>Truthfulness about yourself</b><br> Aristotle put a great premium on honesty. He counseled against “pretense in the form of exaggeration” and boastfulness, but also against self-deprecation. You might say he recommended that we seek something like secure humility, through which we recognize ourselves and can show others who we are without either puffery or self-denigration. This tracks with the general work on humility, which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lisa-Ross-4/publication/357425333_Humility_Personality_and_Psychological_Functioning/links/6238bf09781d2e6df7ab6792/Humility-Personality-and-Psychological-Functioning.pdf">correlates</a> with lower levels of neuroticism and depression, as well as with a greater love of life. But it is also consistent with research <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760801999461">showing</a> that insecurity and excessive self-criticism are associated with anxiety and sadness.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/when-philosophy-becomes-therapy/380531/">Read: When philosophy becomes therapy</a><br><br> <b>8.</b><b> </b><b>公平</b><br>This is a word that gets a lot of attention in our modern debates. It commonly involves efforts to increase fairness and to redress past discrimination. And it is manifestly true that when people believe they are being treated unfairly, it <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797611417262">lowers their happiness</a> . But Aristotle meant something totally different. “The equitable man,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D10">wrote</a> the philosopher, “is one who by choice and habit … does not stand on his rights unduly, but is content to receive a smaller share although he has the law on his side.” He called this “a special kind of Justice.” For this proposition, I can find no specific empirical evidence. However, it is almost certainly related to the next virtue.<br><br> <b>9.</b><b> </b><b>Forgiveness</b><br>亚里士多德<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D11">写到</a>了考虑他人的美德。 To the contemporary ear, this sounds like politeness, or sensitivity to others&#39; feelings, but the philosopher was recommending something much trickier: forgiveness and forbearance toward others&#39; faults. The wisdom of this advice has a large modern literature to support it. Virtually every study of forgiveness <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://osf.io/8qzgw/">shows</a> that practicing it purposefully and letting go of grievances lowers depression and anxiety symptoms.<br><br> <b>10.</b><b> </b><b>Modesty</b><br> Modesty is often thought in the modern world to resemble humility. But Aristotle defined it as refraining from shameful (if tempting) behavior—and applied this even to private conduct. This conception of modesty makes it similar to temperance, except that instead of moderation in the face of base appetites, we should abstain completely from vices. He added a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0054:book=4:chapter=9&amp;highlight=modesty">caveat</a> , however: Modesty could be a virtue only if “a good man would be ashamed if he were to do so and so.” In other words, you have to believe a certain action is vicious in order to be virtuous in avoiding it. I personally have no moral qualms about liquor but don&#39;t drink myself, so by the Aristotelian standard, my teetotaling is not a virtue. Bearing this caveat in mind, this kind of modesty is indeed a happiness strategy: When people undertake what they consider <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1251560?casa_token=RE8pgoNigLIAAAAA:TcdOOZGDpCbkQbmv_wZgSuAGB-YrCj_FrXPAg7kR4I0-p9wP-Bn3iBHGcMVa1TMHqJvHiauz-0vU">moral acts</a> , they gain in happiness and even more so in sense of purpose; when they commit immoral acts, they experience the opposite.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">ristotle proposed these</span> happiness virtues more than two millennia ago, but I believe they provide a handy checklist today for living well.

How could you not? The glaciers, the pine air, the small-town feel. Whitefish was always expensive: When he first got there, Dugan camped on and off for a month before he found an affordable home. But it got far more expensive during the pandemic, when wealthy retirees and digital nomads flooded the tiny town&#39;s tiny housing market. Out-of-staters were making cash offers on homes, sight unseen. Airbnbs started going for Bay Area prices. Rentals dried up. This has become a familiar story across America, where the housing crisis has gotten so severe that even rural communities in northern Montana are feeling the pinch.<br><br> Here&#39;s another familiar story: Seeking to capitalize on the real-estate gold rush, a developer proposed building a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/feb/07/whitefish-council-faces-decision-big-mountain-hous/">handsome 318-unit community</a> just north of downtown, on Whitefish Lake. The property would include a series of low-slung apartment buildings and townhomes, including units reserved for low-income families. Whitefish&#39;s residents freaked. Hundreds submitted letters to the town&#39;s planning committee. Local philanthropists, some billionaires, reportedly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dailyinterlake.com/news/2022/feb/02/donors-threaten-pull-support-if-whitefish-housing-/">threatened to pull</a> their support from local nonprofits if city officials did not <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2022/02/16/how-billionaires-helped-kill-a-housing-development-in-a-montana-ski-town/?sh=cc3d2e1d4b72">nix the proposal</a> . Nearly 200 people showed up at a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cityofwhitefish.org/AgendaCenter/ViewFile/Minutes/_10212021-284">marathon public meeting</a> , one of several, to argue about, and mostly against, the project: It would look too tall, pollute the lake, pollute the night sky with light, change the neighborhood&#39;s character, stress the community&#39;s schools and medical services, destroy wildlife habitats, and increase traffic, which would interrupt snow plows and endanger families fleeing from forest fires. The town rejected the proposal.<br><br> Dugan was at that meeting and left incensed. “There&#39;s a gut reaction in places like this: <em>All development is bad, and we need to stop any development to maintain what we have,</em> ” he told me. “But the people who showed up to that meeting were all older and generally very wealthy.” They made it sound like the new development would ruin their lives, he said. But those people were doing fine. They already had a home in Whitefish.<br><br> Here&#39;s where things get different. NIMBYs have throttled the supply of homes across the country. In Montana, the state government was not just paying attention but primed to do something about it. At the same time that Dugan was steaming over his neighbors in Whitefish, analysts in Helena were worrying about the displacement of middle-class families, and politicians in Bozeman were hearing complaints about long commutes. “I can&#39;t do a town hall in any community in Montana and not have the affordability of housing come up,” Governor Greg Gianforte told me. “Housing prices have just been out of control.”<br><br> Last July, Gianforte created a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deq.mt.gov/about/Housing-Task-Force">housing task force</a> , bringing together homebuilders, politicians, experts, and advocates, including Dugan, who had gone on to found a housing nonprofit called Shelter WF. In October, the group delivered a series of proposals to state officials; in December, to local officials. Montana&#39;s legislature debated a set of bills based on those recommendations. Then it passed them this spring. The state transformed its land-use policies. It set itself up for dense development. It did this on a bipartisan basis and at warp speed.<br><br> Montana&#39;s just one state. But it did something—and maybe enough—to fix its housing crisis.<br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">ver the past decade</span> and change, the country&#39;s housing shortage has spread from coastal cities to suburbs and satellite cities to rural communities and small towns in the Mountain West, the plains, the interior South. Fannie Mae estimates that the country needs 4.4 million <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fanniemae.com/media/45106/display">more homes</a> . The National Association of Realtors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nar.realtor/magazine/real-estate-news/biden-administration-takes-aim-at-america-s-housing-shortage">puts the number at</a> 5.5 million. But the country is not building enough homes to close the gap, or even keep up with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://usafacts.org/articles/population-growth-has-outpaced-home-construction-for-20-years/">population growth</a> .<br><br> Millions of families are stuck in apartments they do not want to live in, paying prices they cannot afford. Eventually, many decamp for low-cost, low-wage regions of the country. “Even before the pandemic, there was an increasing trend of people leaving expensive coastal areas like San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York for more affordable places,” Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist at Redfin, told me. “Then the pandemic hit, and the trend accelerated.”<br><br> In recent years, that migration has buoyed or battered Montana, depending on how you look at it. The state&#39;s population surged 1.6 percent from mid-2020 to mid-2021, faster than that of 47 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2021/2021-population-estimates.html">other states</a> . Montana added nearly 20,000 residents while it permitted just 3,000 new <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MTBP1FH">single-unit homes</a> . Home prices climbed by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MTSTHPI">nearly 50 percent</a> in a matter of months.<br><br> When the pandemic hit, Montana already had a housing shortage; in fact, it had a few of them. First, a dilapidation problem. Building new housing in Montana&#39;s rural reaches is expensive, which leaves many residents occupying decaying and at times dangerous units. (This is a particular problem on Montana&#39;s American Indian reservations.) “If you look at population numbers and counts of housing units in these rural places, it doesn&#39;t <em>look</em> that bad,” Andrew Aurand of the National Low Income Housing Coalition told me. “But when you look at the <em>quality</em> of the housing, the safety of the housing, and the extent to which families are doubling up, the housing crisis is severe.”<br><br> Second, the tight market in resort, gateway, and second-home communities. Coastal-city billionaires and rich retirees keep buying up ranches and lodges in Montana. Their shmancy consumer spending creates jobs. But the people working those jobs end up living in campers close by or in homes far, far away, because there is just not enough housing.<br><br> Third, a shortage of affordable homes in Montana&#39;s population centers, such as Billings and Missoula. “The math does not work” for homebuilders to create low-income housing anywhere in the country absent government subsidies, Jeffrey Lubell, the director of housing and community initiatives for Abt Associates, told me. The math especially does not work in Montana, where frozen ground shortens the construction season, and where a lack of skilled tradespeople drives up costs.<br><br> These problems collided with the state&#39;s pandemic-era population surge. “I started looking around and thinking, <em>Holy cow, prices are going up</em> ,” Christopher Dorrington, the director of the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and the chair of Gianforte&#39;s housing task force, told me. The state suddenly had a noticeable homeless population; town squares and vacant lots filled with tents in the summertime. All but the very wealthiest families started feeling strained. “You couldn&#39;t move, because supply was so short,” Adam Hertz, a real-estate developer and former member of Montana&#39;s house, told me.<br><br> Gianforte said that the answer was obvious to him: Montana had a supply crisis. It needed a supply solution. His task force soon figured out how to get Montana more housing: Make it possible for folks to build housing units by right, rather than having every development go through a miserable, expensive process of negotiation. Encourage dense development in already dense areas. Cut red tape. Indeed, Montana already had pretty loose <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://realestate.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/558.pdf">building regulations</a> , and legislators loosened them even further—functionally banning single-family zoning and preventing towns and cities from adding onerous zoning policies, among many other changes and investments.<br><br> “We obviously did not anticipate being able to get the big wins we did,” Kendall Cotton, the founder of the local think tank the Frontier Institute and a driving force behind the housing bills, told me. “We thought maybe there might be one bill that passed. We ended up getting almost everything that we were asking for.”<br><br> Montana&#39;s policies aren&#39;t perfect. There still isn&#39;t enough incentive for developers to create low-income housing units, experts told me. Housing costs won&#39;t decline immediately, because building takes time (and because high interest rates have frozen the development pipeline). Montana has weak tenant protections and too few resources for struggling renters, antipoverty advocates said.<br><br> Still, housing experts around the country are cheering. Montana now arguably has the most pro-development, pro-housing set of policies of any state. How did this policy phenomenon happen, and so fast?<br><br> The explanation has something to do with the nature of Montana&#39;s housing crisis, and something to do with the nature of Montana itself. The fact that so many people in such a small state found themselves affected at once pushed legislators to act. “We were victims of our own success,” Hertz, the developer and former state representative, told me. “We&#39;ve been having all of these discussions about how to get people to move to Montana and start a business here: <em>How do we get more tourism in Montana? How do we get tech businesses here?</em> We got the demand, and wow, we got caught totally flat-footed on the supply side.”<br><br> Politics, for once, helped too. Montana had lower housing prices and fewer roadblocks to development than other states to begin with. Republicans with a strong libertarian streak, like Gianforte himself, are a powerful bloc, and happen to be the kind of folks thrilled to slash red tape. Joining them were anti-sprawl environmentalists, student activists, urban-density advocates, real-estate developers, and antipoverty liberals, creating a coalition spanning from the far left to the far right. The fact that Gianforte pushed so hard on the issue and that Montana&#39;s legislature meets only once every two years put more pressure on those elected officials to get something big done.<br><br> Yet perhaps the biggest motivating factor—one mentioned by nearly every Montanan I spoke with—was California. Montana did not want sprawl ruining its wildlands, as happened in the Central Valley and along the Pacific Coast. Montana did not want San Francisco&#39;s sky-high inequality and huge homeless population. Montana did not want middle-class families squeezed out, as they were in Oakland and San Diego. Montana did not want to throttle its own economy, as the Bay Area did.<br><br> “If you have single-family zoning and bury your head, you will eventually face San Francisco&#39;s problems. It&#39;s not just the high cost of housing. It&#39;s a high cost of living, wealth inequality, homelessness, and crime,” Fairweather of Redfin said. “All cities should look at San Francisco as an example of what happens when you do nothing.” Montana did, benefiting from California&#39;s missteps and learning from its YIMBY advocates.<br><br> Many other communities are doing the same. Washington and Maine are banning <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/politics/was-new-ban-on-single-family-zoning-exempts-some-of-seattles-wealthiest-neighborhoods/">single-family zoning</a> , as Oregon did in 2019. A number of cities are allowing single-room-occupancy buildings, getting rid of parking minimums, and letting homeowners build second properties on their lots. YIMBY groups are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/where-pro-housing-groups-are-emerging/">blanketing the country</a> , pushing for denser development. Dugan&#39;s is one of them. He&#39;s hopeful that the state&#39;s new policies will increase the housing supply in Whitefish, where he and his partner just—finally—bought a home.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Wed, 09 Aug 2023 15:02:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/rural-montana-housing-crisis-supply/674950/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/rural-montana-housing-crisis-supply/674950/</item></channel></rss>
