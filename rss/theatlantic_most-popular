referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>华纳兄弟影业公司</figcaption></figure>我认识很多与男人结婚的令人印象深刻的女人。也许男人们也令人印象深刻。老实说，我并没有过多考虑他们。当我了解这些女性所做的一切并对世界现状表示同情时，我们很少有时间谈论她们的丈夫。有时，出于礼貌，我会问，但通常不会出现，除非正在酝酿某些冲突。这并不意味着我的朋友不爱他们的伴侣——只是，当有空间谈论他们的生活时，这就是他们想要谈论的：<i>他们的</i>生活。<br><br>看着<i>芭比娃娃</i>，我记得当我还是个女孩的时候和芭比娃娃一起玩时，肯很少出现在我的叙述中。芭比盛装打扮去上班和和朋友们出去玩；当我需要一个戏剧性的故事情节时，肯就会出现。一场婚礼！一场热血的战斗！配偶出轨！ （我能说什么？我是看着<i>《达拉斯》</i>和电视剧长大的。）<br><br>这种态度是和我一起玩的女孩们的典型态度。同样典型的是，当我们到了十几岁和二十多岁的时候，情况发生了多大的变化。随着玩偶被丢弃，游戏被重新定义为泡吧、酒吧、核对我们杰出女性宾果卡上的每件事（最终，你猜对了，婚姻），肯一家不再是客串明星。这个故事——我一生的命运——围绕着男人和他们的行为。他们在干什么？他们在想什么？他们在想我什么？关于我们？关于我们的未来？！一起？！！<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">阅读：理解芭比电影的令人惊讶的关键</a><br><br>但随着年龄的增长，我的态度又发生了转变。这并不是说我不爱男人，也不喜欢他们的想法和陪伴。我和他们约会。我将他们视为朋友和同事。但与人结合并不是我现在的主要关注点。而且，老实说，除了少数例外，我觉得她们并不像我认识的女性那样有趣。我不认为我是唯一一个这样做的人。<br><br>这是格蕾塔·葛韦格扮演的<i>芭比娃娃</i>揭露的秘密。<br><br>当谈到我们最亲密的友谊时，我认识的许多女性已经生活在芭比娃娃的世界里。正是这些女性让我们感到惊讶、惊奇、愉悦，她们把事情做好，把家庭经营得井井有条。在我们看来，他们的伴侣和丈夫是“和肯斯”——在我们朋友忙碌的生活中支持玩家，推动职业进步、跨国搬家和房屋装修，同时在崩溃的世界中照顾年迈的父母和养育孩子。<br><br>虽然我认识的大多数女性都会和她们的女朋友一起去看<i>芭比娃娃</i>，但我的一些好朋友却是和她们的丈夫一起去看的。每个人都表示很喜欢这部电影，但不止一个人提到，在之后的几小时和几天里，丈夫们都患有严重的阴郁的 Kenergy。他们挠头担心：他们是自己家里的“肯夫妇”吗？坐在芭比驾驶的粉色双人自行车后座上？<br><br><i>芭比</i>不是一部完美或交叉的电影。它呈现了对女性复杂性的狭隘且主要是白人的看法。但它确实以极大的幽默和纯粹心碎的时刻揭示了许多女性看待和体验世界的方式。这部电影风格化且讽刺，但在粉红色的 Pepto Bismol 之下却隐藏着很多真相。而真相，尤其是女性的真相，可能会让人感到不舒服。<br><br>在女性友谊的范围内，芭比<i>就是</i>一切。但在这个空间之外，女性常常被视为一无是处。葛韦格当然知道这一点。正如亚美莉卡·费雷拉 (America Ferrera) 饰演的格洛丽亚 (Gloria) 在她充满激情的独白中所说，在现实世界中不可能成为一名女性。这个世界是由男人创造的，也是为了男人而创造的，他们不必考虑芭比需要多少劳动力来维持梦想之家的运转。<br><br>这是许多女性群聊和 Instagram 分享中的一个熟悉的主题，但我不确定它是否得到了好莱坞通常为有关超级英雄、枪支或男人炸毁事物的电影保留的大预算流行文化饱和待遇。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-ken/674852/">阅读：芭比就是一切。肯就是其他一切。</a><br><br>也许没有什么比男人可能并不总是女人思想和世界的中心这一事实更令人不安的了。<br><br>这或许可以解释为什么关于这部电影的大量讨论和媒体——完全是关于女性、由女性制作的——已经转向以男性为中心。具体来说，肯.我们现在已经阅读了有关<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jul/25/ryan-gosling-ken-barbie-movie">瑞恩·高斯林</a>（精彩）表演的文章、肯对<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://screenrant.com/barbie-2-new-ken-actors-fancasting/">续集</a>。<br><br>当然，这些都是关于一部有趣的电影的有趣的事情。但她们的数量之多让我想知道：我们是否对在女性的叙述中徘徊感到如此不舒服，以至于我们——甚至我们当中的女性——不得不急于谈论男性？难道我们就这么害怕伤害男人的感情吗？<br><br>看<i>《芭比娃娃》</i>时我笑了很多，但也哭了很多——作为一个女孩是多么艰难，作为一个女人是多么艰难，世界还要多长时间才能拍出另一部关于我们生活的大制作电影和想法。我什至有点迷茫地想到现在作为一个男人是多么的困惑和挑战。<br><br>但如果有续集，请不要以肯为主角。<br><br></div>

World]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>两年前妻子去世后，理查德·E·格兰特开始拍摄自己谈论丧亲之痛的视频，创造了失去亲人后的非凡生活记录。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/8ny6MtCE5Eq8BE0Kxg8D-bkQGhM=/0x0:3307x4134/648x810/media/img/2023/07/31/eyevine03346058/original.jpg" alt="演员理查德·E·格兰特闭着眼睛的肖像" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>索菲亚·斯普林 / Guardian / eyevine / Redux</figcaption></figure>在镜头前，演员理查德·E·格兰特倾向于散发出一种不为人知的、阴暗的气质：无论他的角色表达了多少，你总是能感觉到字里行间有一些无法校准的东西。在他的新回忆录<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/a-pocketful-of-happiness-a-memoir-richard-e-grant/9781668030691?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>《一袋幸福》</em></a>中，格兰特优雅地将自己的职业生涯概括为数十年的“极简主义恶行”。他的角色包罗万象，从享乐主义的浪荡演员（《 <em>Withnail and I</em> 》）到专制的女子乐队经理（ <em>《Spice World》</em> ），再到迷人的犯罪同伙（他在<em>《你能原谅我吗？</em> 》中获得奥斯卡提名的角色），但如果他们有共同的共同点属性，那就是如果他们偷了你的钱包，你甚至不会感到惊讶。<br><br>然而在生活中，格兰特将诚实变成了一种富有创造力、极其精致的艺术形式。大约两年前，与他结婚 35 年的妻子、方言教练琼·华盛顿 (Joan Washington) 因肺癌去世，在失去她的几个月后，他在 Instagram 上记录了丧亲之痛的片段。在典型的视频中，他的脸稍微偏离中心，视线远离镜头。他看上去衣衫不整。他看起来很闹鬼。 “令人难以理解的是，我们再也不能互相接触或交谈了，”他在一卷中说道。在另一张照片中，他拍摄了自己走过树林的情景，简单地说：“一次一步。”<br><br>在悲痛之中——这是最孤立的状态——格兰特迅速建立了社区。 “在您与我们分享的这些深思熟虑的视频中，我找到了令人难以置信的安慰；他们美丽的诚实，他们的痛苦，但总是在美好生活的更大马赛克中仔细地重新构建每一件作品，”最近当格兰特分享他母亲去世的消息时，一位女士评论道。总的来说，这些上传的内容可能会让人迷失方向，这也是它们作为失去亲人后的生活记录如此具有启发性的原因。格兰特发布了来自朋友家的视频；他推广自己的项目；他重新创作了<em>《Withnail》</em>中的场景来打发隔离期间的 10 天时间。但一切的根本原因是琼的缺席——正如他在澳大利亚海滩上散步时在一篇帖子中所说的那样，这种感觉“就像一只没有壳的老乌龟”。<br><br>今年春天早些时候，当我在格兰特位于伦敦西南部的家中会见他时，他似乎仍然对过去几年的悲伤、生产力和公众反应的融合感到茫然。在他的文学经纪人和女儿的敦促下，他写了一本关于琼生命最后几个月的回忆录，其中穿插了他职业生涯过去几年的故事。由此产生的书<em>《一袋幸福》</em>本月在美国出版，以琼去世前给他的遗嘱命名，保证如果他能试着找到一点点来感激每一个幸福，他就会没事。单日。 “在我们的婚姻中，她以前从来没有想到过这句话，”66 岁的格兰特说道，他身材修长，穿着黑色灯芯绒裤子和黑色衬衫，腿上抱着女儿的猫。 “我想，如果我们中有人说过这句话，我们就会得出结论，这听起来像是霍尔马克卡片上的内容。但事实证明，这是一个非常深刻的生活准则。”<br><br>他决定将最迷人的高潮（奥斯卡奖、与奥利维亚·科尔曼在贝蒂·戴维斯以前拥有的房子里唱卡拉 OK）和最惨淡的低谷（琼的诊断、有一天格兰特无意中使用<em>“终端”</em>一词时她的愤怒）共同构成这本书的叙述他说，这是出于他想要准确捕捉大多数人的生活的愿望。 1986 年，也就是格兰特与琼结婚的那一年，格兰特充其量只是一名打工演员，负责拼凑地区戏剧片尾字幕和电视电影。在经历了九个月的痛苦失业之后，丹尼尔·戴·刘易斯拒绝了他的一个角色：布鲁斯·罗宾逊的半自传故事片中华丽、浑身湿透的威斯奈尔。这份工作是一个巨大的突破。第一周排练结束时，怀孕27周的琼就早产了。他们的第一个孩子蒂芙尼只活了半个小时，她的肺部尚未发育成熟，无法自行呼吸。 “我不认为你能克服它，”格兰特说。 “你可以绕过它。”<br><br> <em>《一袋幸福》</em>捕捉到了如何在灾难性消息发生时完全摆脱困境，即使是在持续的承诺和繁杂的日常任务中。格兰特写道，在等待琼的放射治疗开始时整理花园，收拾起琼的衣服盒子以腾出空间，并为她可能再也不会穿它们而感到震惊。他们的关系是这本书引人入胜的中心支柱——一位极其注重隐私的苏格兰方言教练和一位来自南部非洲斯威士兰、比她小十岁、长期过度兴奋、心直口快的演员之间一段不可预测的持久爱情。在他们关系之初，琼的事业已经很成熟，而格兰特则在做服务员。在他们的婚姻过程中，地位的平衡发生了变化，但他对我说，他们从未失去联系：“一段从 1983 年 1 月在床上谈话开始的关系，以床上握着彼此的手而结束。” 38 年后与她交谈。”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/05/emma-straub-interview-this-time-tomorrow-grief/674035/">阅读：现代生活的决定性情感</a><br><br>在这本书去年首次出版的欧洲和澳大利亚，格兰特带着这本书进行了巡回演出，举办了一场戏剧表演，其中融入了琼的视频和照片；在第二幕中，观众有机会分享自己的悲伤。他愿意表现出一种通常被认为是私人的经历——如此积极地颠覆我们的感觉，即“正确”的方式来度过它是坚忍的、孤独的——是惊人的。他对在丧亲之痛后立即给予人们空间的不言而喻的传统不屑一顾，而这正是“你需要人们倾诉的时刻”。对于那些根本不承认琼死讯的人，他的态度明显很凶猛。今年早些时候，他发布了一段视频，内容是在法国偶遇一对夫妇，他们是他认识 25 年的朋友，但他们在街上明显避开了他，而不是对没有联系表示遗憾。 “我感觉自己好像被打了一巴掌，”他告诉我，气得浑身发抖。<br><br>在 Instagram 上，正如他的许多评论者所明确指出的那样，他的言论产生了强烈的认可感。他愿意公开哀悼，这引发了一些问题：如果分享悲伤可以让人感觉宣泄，为什么要隐藏悲伤呢？为什么悲伤的配偶、父母、孩子应该安静地表达呢？为什么我们对那些正在经历巨大损失的人的本能反应是躲起来并躲起来？ “我认为（人们）担心他们要么会入侵，要么你会像人行道上的果冻一样崩溃，”格兰特说。他承认，他仍然有被悲伤“折磨”的日子，唯一能做的就是屈服并等待它过去，但他也有美好的日子，灿烂的日子，充满幸福的日子。 。他在导演埃默拉尔德·芬内尔（《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/12/emerald-fennell-promising-young-woman-subverting-femininity/617467/"><em>前途无量的年轻女子</em></a>》）备受期待的第二部长片<em>《索尔特伯恩》</em>中扮演角色。他还计划出演萨姆·门德斯和阿曼多·伊安努奇关于超级英雄系列的新 HBO 讽刺剧，以及与保罗·路德和珍娜·奥尔特加合作的 A24 的<em>《独角兽之死》</em> 。 （后者是今年夏天在演员罢工期间获准拍摄的少数独立项目之一。）<br><br>他认为，他现在所做的很多事情——巡回售书、现场活动——放在过去都太令人生畏了。 “琼之死的重新调整让我意识到，你所担心的所有这些事情都与自我有关，”他说。 “处理死亡是如此灾难性的，以至于它简化了其他一切。”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

2026 年民主党在国会取得压倒性胜利，甚至足以撼动特朗普领导的共和党。<br><br>特朗普可能会想象他手头上有一场一劳永逸的战斗：猛烈打击，快速打击，然后安安静静地享受不法权力的腐败特权。如果是这样，他和他的追随者就是在自欺欺人。整个任期都被围绕特朗普利用总统权力保护自己免受涉嫌犯罪后果的斗争所消耗。<br><br> <a

年的多数裁决反映了法官们通过推理得出了在法律上站得住脚、实际上可行的结论，无论你是否同意他们的观点。这些裁决根本没有提供任何依据来质疑法院的合法性，而那些这样做的人不仅目光短浅、轻率，而且具有误导性。<br><br><b>投票权案件</b><br><br>在本学期的两起案件中， <a data-event-element="inline link"

(John Roberts) 撰写的一份意见中，以 6 比 3

（类似地，在<i>《美国诉德克萨斯州》</i>中，以 8 比 1 的多数裁定德克萨斯州和路易斯安那州这两个由共和党控制的州缺乏宪法第三条规定的资格来挑战拜登的移民执法政策。）一些观察家认为<i>摩尔v. 哈珀案</i>对于捍卫美国民主、反对民粹右翼窃取 2020 年选举的努力至关重要。<br><br>律师兼评论员戴维·弗伦奇 (David French) <a

Prime 送货服务的城市的天主教教区出售蜡烛一样？<br><br> <i>303 Creative LLC 诉 Elenis 案</i>的不同寻常之处在于，案件双方在许多此类区别上达成了一致。尼尔·戈萨奇法官的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-476_c185.pdf">多数意见</a>总结了这些无可争议的事项：史密斯将“乐意为任何性取向的客户创建”图形和网站。她不会为任何性取向的客户创作“与圣经真理相矛盾”的内容。她相信婚姻是一男一女的结合，这是“一种真诚的宗教信仰”。史密斯计划的网站“本质上将具有表现力”，并将表达她的信仰，同时庆祝她对以自己名义命名的婚姻的看法，并注明出处。如果史密斯拒绝客户，许多其他公司“提供定制网站设计服务”。<br><br>

年民权法案保护同性恋和变性雇员免受歧视”）在他的多数意见中写道，根据科罗拉多州的逻辑，“政府可以强迫任何人如果该主题以某种方式暗示了客户受法定保护的特征，则该主题的付费发言者将接受该主题的所有佣金（无论其背后的信息如何）。严肃地说，这一原则将允许政府强迫各种艺术家、演讲撰稿人和其他涉及言论服务的人说出他们不相信的内容，否则将受到处罚。”<br><br>戈萨奇还小心翼翼地澄清，“我们并不质疑公共设施法在实现所有美国人的公民权利方面发挥的重要作用”，并指出法院不断承认“消除公共设施场所歧视的‘令人信服的利益’， ”并明确指出州政府可以保护同性恋者获得“无数的商品和服务，没有人会认为这些商品和服务与第一修正案有关。”<br><br>尽管裁决明确表明，许多公共住宿法都通过了宪法审查，而有些法律“在部署以强制言论时范围过于广泛”，但如何决定边缘案例还不太清楚。 “确定什么是受第一修正案保护的表达活动，有时会引发棘手的问题，”戈萨奇写道。 “但本案并没有出现此类并发症。”如果未来的一些裁决允许因为同性恋者本身的性取向而拒绝与他们做生意，或者开始将每个餐馆老板、旅馆老板、水管工、机械师和牙医视为创意专业人士，我会非常担心同性恋者的后果人们试图平等地驾驭社会。但这个裁决并没有到那里。<br><br>至于其实际后果：同性伴侣是否会很难找到创意婚礼工作的供应商？值得庆幸的是，没有。 71% 的美国人支持同性婚姻，89% 的 18 至 29 岁人群也支持同性婚姻。索尼娅·索托马约尔法官在她的异议中担心，拒绝为同性婚礼制作网站的平面设计师会侮辱同性恋者；我认为拒绝参与同性婚礼的婚礼行业人士更有可能给自己的生意带来耻辱。有多少订婚的同性恋夫妇甚至想聘请一位强烈反对同性婚姻的创意专业人士来与他们合作举办婚礼？<br><br> 20年后回顾这个案件，我怀疑我们会得出这样的结论：法院实现了合理、实际的权利平衡，继续为公共设施中的歧视提供实质性保护——并且其强迫言论先例将被再次援引再次由美国人，包括同性恋者和进步人士，捍卫他们的权利，反对国家行为者以我们尚未预料到的方式进行强制。<br><br><b>学生债务案件</b><br><br>在<a data-event-element="inline link"

的投票结果裁定，拜登政府的教育部长“声称《英雄法案》赋予他取消 4,300 亿美元学生贷款本金的权力。它不是。”<br><br>民主党参议员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/1674794719048781825">查克·舒默(Chuck

抱怨法院“拒绝遵循学生贷款取消法律的简单语言”，仿佛学生贷款债务取消不仅合法，而且显然是合法的，因此任何相反的裁决都是恶意固执。无论喜欢还是讨厌这项裁决，这些批评都具有严重的误导性。<br><br>拜登超越了行政部门的合法权力并不是 MAGA 共和党人原创或独有的观点。 2021 年，教育部总法律顾问办公室被要求权衡教育部长是否拥有取消、免除或免除学生贷款的法定权力。

日，众议员南希·佩洛西被问及取消学生贷款债务的不同方法。 “人们认为美国总统拥有免除债务的权力，”<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.ph/xCDHb">她说</a>。 “他没有。他可以推迟。他可以拖延。但他没有那个权力。这必须是国会的一项行为……总统只能推迟、拖延，但不能原谅。”<br><br> <a

是一位总统权力专家，曾是时任进步派参议员拉斯·法因戈尔德 (Russ Feingold) 的顾问，也是布伦南司法中心 (Brennan Center for Justice) 的高级主任。她在 2022 年<i>《华盛顿邮报》的</i>一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/09/01/biden-student-debt-emergency-powers-are-slippery-slope/">专栏文章</a>中谈到了学生贷款争议。她写道：“拜登不能使用紧急权力来免除某些私人学生贷款债务或在covid-19紧急声明失效后产生的债务。” “通过紧急权力将国会边缘化意味着将维护我们自由和民主的制衡边缘化。”<br><br>人们甚至不需要同意教育部总法律顾问，或者佩洛西在 2021 年表达的观点，或者罗斯或戈伊坦，就可以看到沃伦所做的描述是极其不诚实的：这完全是错误的任何读过法律明文的理性人都站在拜登一边。国会可以随时取消学生贷款债务。这样做的唯一障碍是那些赞成取消这项法律的人无法通过这样一项法律，因为美国民选代表对此的支持不够。这不在最高法院的范围内。<br><br><b>一致和近乎一致的决定</b><br><br>最有趣和最容易理解的一致判决是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/600/22-174/#tab-opinion-4758923"><i>格罗夫诉德乔伊案</i></a>。此案涉及福音派基督徒杰拉尔德·格罗夫(Gerald Groff)，他在美国邮政局找到了一份工作，当时不需要在基督教安息日工作。但时代变了：美国邮政局与亚马逊达成协议，在周日送货。<br><br>为了继续遵守《十诫》中规定的安息日，格罗夫转移到逃离亚马逊的送货足迹，最终来到宾夕法尼亚州的小霍尔特伍德，但亚马逊既不为人也不为上帝休息，也在那里扩张。随后，格罗夫开始因拒绝周日劳动而受到举报。因此，他根据 1964 年《民权法案》第七章提起诉讼。据他所说，美国邮政局可以“不经意间”满足他的宗教信仰。对于一致同意的法院，塞缪尔·阿利托法官写道，“过度困难”是指“当雇主的整体业务负担很大时”，而不是当有任何微不足道的成本时（一些下级法院错误地采用了这一标准，因为）过去案例中的语言）。法院裁定，雇主“必须证明提供便利的负担将导致与其开展特定业务相关的成本大幅增加”。<br><br>无论好坏，它都站在工人一边，反对大雇主的利益。它可能会略微使各种信仰的宗教工作者受益，同时也会略微增加公司和其他企业的负担。这与法院的“右翼”特征如何相符？<br><br>对于我们的目的来说，不如<a

拍摄了一张照片。后来，她向<i>《名利场》</i>授予了一次性许可，允许其使用王子的照片作为“插图的艺术家参考”——这意味着<i>《名利场》</i>聘请了著名的流行艺术家安迪·沃霍尔为王子绘制插图。沃霍尔根据这张照片创作了一系列不同的图像。他的作品中有一幅丝网印刷肖像<i>《橙色王子》</i> ， <i>《名利场</i>》的母公司将其重新用于 2016 年的封面。这是否侵犯了摄影师的版权或合理使用？<br><br>索托马约尔站在摄影师一边，撰写了多数意见，托马斯、阿利托、戈萨奇和巴雷特以及科坦吉·布朗·杰克逊和布雷特·卡瓦纳也加入了其中。罗伯茨和埃琳娜·卡根共同持反对意见。我不知道谁说得对，但是法官联盟的变化破坏了党派站在他们的团队一边的还原论叙述。<br><br><b>赌注</b><br><br>对主要机构的不准确描述总是值得纠正的，但当最高法院受到那些试图破坏最高法院的人的不准确攻击时，风险尤其高。<br><br>只要法院失去了地位和合法性，它就失去了制衡和制衡政府其他部门未来滥用权力的能力，<i>其所</i>有先例也失去了地位。<br><br>由于右翼有时会获胜，因此更容易看到合法最高法院的价值。对上一届堕胎决定感到痛苦的进步人士可能会本能地认为，如果最高法院失去影响力，那会是件好事。但这是短视的。由于<i>多布斯</i>，堕胎问题又回到了政府的政治部门。如果高等法院在美国人的生活中失去权力，堕胎权的支持者也不会好过——这个问题仍然会由联邦和州一级的民选官员来处理。<br><br>然而，如果法院失去合法性——如果人民和政治部门不再尊重其裁决——美国人将失去各种权利和保护，就像<i>米兰达案</i>中对执法的限制、<i>纽约时报公司诉纽约时报案中对新闻保护的限制一样。

沙利文</i>，以及<i>奥伯格费尔</i>的婚姻权保护。如果没有强大的最高法院，我不禁想到最倒退的南方腹地立法者将如何绘制重新划分选区的地图并限制投票权。<br><br>那么，对于不喜欢目前最高法院多数席位并希望推翻其裁决的民主党人和进步人士，我有什么建议呢？回想一下沃伦法院的时代，被许多人认为是一个特别左倾的时代，以及伦奎斯特法院及以后的时代，当时保守派认为他们已经成功地选出了任命了他们喜欢的多数的总统，结果却是看到堕胎和平权行动得到维护。在那些日子里，当保守派节节败退，或者尽管经过数十年的努力仍未能夺回阵地时，你会认为什么是合理的批评，什么是对司法合法性的腐蚀性攻击？让这些——以及真相——成为你的指南。同时，做到忍、忍、劝，赢得选举。法庭的另一个时代总会到来。<br><br></div>

（当她被指责长期存在种族主义比喻时，她回应说，“当一个人试图在某个职业中站稳脚跟时，他无法选择角色。他必须接受所提供的一切。”）黄在好莱坞历史上占有独特的地位。以及20世纪亚裔美国人的历史；正如黄所说，她的存在是由“同时排斥和欲望”决定的。通过详细描述她面对这些挑战时的韧性，黄讲述了一个关于亚裔在美国脆弱地位的重要故事。 <em>—<a data-event-element="inline

Others lived with the mess and stagnated. Women did most of the cleanup, as part of bucket brigades, because of a postwar imbalance in the population—many men never returned home from the front. For every 1,000 German men in 1950, there were 1,362 women. This is the off-kilter society dissected in Jähner&#39;s highly readable cultural history. What makes his book so fascinating—and so poignant—is the relative banality of his subject: a country of one-night stands and wild dance parties, with little recognition of the atrocities it had committed. In fact, Germany largely wallowed in self-pity. Rendered with irony and based on skillful scholarship, Jähner&#39;s book describes both a democratic rebirth and a moral evasion, uncomfortably and inextricably linked. — <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/franklin-foer/"><em>FF</em></a><br><br> <span class="section-headline-top">Feel Wonder</span> <span class="section-headline-bottom"><em>About the Universe</em></span><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/francisco-alison-mills-newman/9780811232395?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Francisco</em></a><br><br> by Alison Mills Newman<br><br> Mills Newman originally published <em>Francisco</em> , based on her life and love affair with her eventual husband, the director Francisco Newman, in 1974; the publisher New Directions rereleased it earlier this year. It&#39;s told by a young Black actor in California, and the eponymous character is her lover, who is obsessively working on a documentary. The narrator is dissatisfied with Hollywood and her career, but she&#39;s hungry for everything else life offers. She is a wise and insightful reader of people, and she and Francisco hang out with a lot of them, up and down the coast of California. Mills Newman&#39;s novel feels like a long party, punctuated by difficult questions: about white standards of beauty, what it really means to be a revolutionary, how to be an artist, and how to be a woman partnered with a man. In the decades since it was published, Mills Newman has become a devout Christian and come to reject elements of the novel. These include, as she mentions in a new afterword, the “profanity, lifestyle of fornication, that i no longer endorse”—adding another layer of complexity to this curious, short book. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/maya-chung/">MC</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1999368436/?tag=theatl0c-20"><em>Elena Knows</em></a><br><br> by Claudia Piñeiro, translated by Frances Riddle<br><br> <em>Elena Knows</em> is a mystery novel, but it&#39;s certainly not a traditional page-turner.

She&#39;s traveling by train to reach someone she believes can help her find her daughter&#39;s killer, but the journey is near impossible: Even when her medication is working, she can&#39;t lift her head to see where she&#39;s going or walk without great effort. As her pills wear off, she risks being stranded wherever she happens to be at the time. Still, Elena&#39;s not meant to be pitied; she&#39;s flawed and funny and irreverent. (Her name for Parkinson&#39;s is “fucking whore illness.”) Piñeiro&#39;s book is smartly plotted and genuinely suspenseful, but her greatest achievement lies elsewhere: She describes Elena&#39;s minute-by-minute experience so meticulously that I was almost able to comprehend—even just for a moment—the incredible multitude of perspectives that exist in this world at once.

Her book reimagines the real Gunness, a late-19th-century Norwegian immigrant and early American female serial killer, as a woman overcome by yearning. Belle can&#39;t shut her eyes to the dazzling, splendid world; in Searls&#39;s translation, the thoughts running through Belle&#39;s head are breathless. “All this longing, this dripping love-sweat, it stuck to everything she did,” the narration frantically recounts. From the first pages she craves a blissful obliteration that can be found only through intimacy. After she moves from Norway to the American Midwest, her desire curdles into something more delusional that threatens everyone in her orbit—especially her lovers. Kielland gives readers scarce glimpses of lucidity as the novel takes on the tone of a dream. Belle has “the northern light tangled around her ribs”; she feels “the wet grass grow in her mouth.” Empathy slowly turns to horror, though, as it becomes clear that nothing can fill up the canyon inside her except an ultimate, bloody climax. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/emma-sarappo/">ES</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0399573003/?tag=theatl0c-20"><em>The Afterlives</em></a><br><br> by Thomas Pierce<br><br> <em>The Afterlives</em> is set in the near future, in a town full of holograms; the plot involves a haunted staircase, a “reunion machine” meant to reunite the living and the dead, and a physicist who argues that everything in existence is roughly 7 percent unreal. And yet, the protagonist—a 33-year-old loan officer named Jim—is a thoroughly normal guy. Even as the book&#39;s events spin off in strange, supernatural directions, its real focus is on Jim and his developing relationship with Annie, a high-school girlfriend who&#39;s recently been widowed; when they&#39;re offered the chance to try the reunion machine, the story is less concerned with the details of that futuristic technology than it is with Annie&#39;s grief and Jim&#39;s quiet, persistent love for her. No matter how surreal things become, Pierce implies, people will keep moving forward in much the same way, living humdrum little lives together, wondering and hoping in the face of existential mystery. Our desperate curiosity about the afterlife is really about <em>this</em> life, and the people in it we don&#39;t want to give up. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/faith-hill/">FH</a></em><br><br> <span class="section-headline-top">An Old</span> <span class="section-headline-bottom"><em>Gem</em></span><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-annotated-mrs-dalloway-merve-emre/9781631496769?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Mrs. Dalloway</em></a><br><br> by Virginia Woolf<br><br> Woolf&#39;s 1925 fourth novel, <em>Mrs. Dalloway</em> , is made for summer reading or rereading, overflowing with vitality. “What a morning—fresh as if issued to children on a beach. What a lark!

An upper-class English woman in her early 50s, she is preparing to throw a party with her husband that evening, not yet aware that two people she once loved passionately will be there. Woolf slips in and out of Clarissa&#39;s consciousness, “tunneling” (her term) into other minds, too, as the day unfolds. The most notable of them belongs to Septimus Smith, a young World War I veteran who hallucinates, hears voices, and speaks of suicide—and yet who is, like Clarissa, a celebrant of life in all its abundance: For him, death offers the only way to preserve his vision of plenitude. Treat yourself to a beautiful supplement as well, <em>The Annotated Mrs. Dalloway</em> , full of notes, photos, and insights, and edited by the critic Merve Emre.

Bayoux is a middle-aged Black intellectual, a former United Nations official who seems to know everyone and can opine on every topic; he is also an alcoholic at the bottom of a deep pit. Weissnix is a 21-year-old Jewish refugee from Vienna who can barely speak English when the book begins, unsure if she has been orphaned by the war. The story of their affair is also a story about Ilsa&#39;s American education: She learns from Bayoux how to function at the margins, how to succeed by charming, how never to lose a sense of one&#39;s own distance from the center. The more she grows into her independence, though, the further he sinks, until it&#39;s clear that he can&#39;t be saved even as she begins to build a life of her own. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/gal-beckerman/">GB</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-stone-face-william-gardner-smith/9781681375168?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Stone Face</em></a><br><br> by William Gardner Smith<br><br> Following the path of James Baldwin, Richard Wright, and Chester Himes, a Black American émigré arrives in 1950s Paris to find an existential freedom in the city&#39;s cafés and bars, a space free of white leering and judgment. Simeon Brown, an aspiring painter and the protagonist of Smith&#39;s deeply underappreciated novel, grew up in Philadelphia, where he suffered a brutal racist attack that left him blind in one eye, an incident that haunts him. While abroad, his reprieve from racial animus dissolves when he befriends a group of young Arabs struggling against France&#39;s colonial atrocities in Algeria. These young men see Simeon as benefiting from a kind of whiteness, insofar as he&#39;s free from the racial violence of their state. But Simeon&#39;s Black expat friends believe taking up the Arab cause risks the very freedom they all came searching for. Trapped by a dizzying moral question, Simeon is forced to confront the shifting realities of identity and racial allegiance as he fights the personal demons that have followed him across the ocean. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/oliver-munday/">Oliver Munday</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/hotel-du-lac-anita-brookner/9780679759324?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Hotel du Lac</em></a><br><br> by Anita Brookner<br><br> <em>Hotel du Lac</em> is <em>technically</em> a vacation novel. On the page, though, it&#39;s much cooler and more dispassionate than that description implies. When Edith Hope, a 39-year-old romance writer, arrives at a Swiss hotel as fall begins for a period of self-imposed exile, the landscape is gray, the gardens are damp, and everything in her bedroom is “the color of overcooked veal.” Edith has committed a sin that Brookner withholds until midway through. Suffering through dreary evening dinners with the Hotel du Lac&#39;s similarly compromised guests is her uncomfortable penance, until she receives an offer that forces her to think about how she really wants to live. The novel, Brookner&#39;s fourth, drew uncharitable responses after it won the Booker Prize in 1984. But there&#39;s fascinating, bracing tension amid the book&#39;s women, each deemed unfit to be anywhere else: Monica, whose aristocratic husband bristles at her eating disorder; the narcissistic, flamboyant widow Iris Pusey and her stolid daughter, Jennifer; the elderly Madame de Bonneuil, deaf and desperately lonely. Edith can&#39;t quite bond with any of them—she&#39;s too brittle and skeptical for sisterhood—but each woman shades a different kind of existence that throws Edith&#39;s final decision into sharper relief. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/sophie-gilbert/">Sophie Gilbert</a></em><br><br> <span class="section-headline-top">Devour Something</span> <span class="section-headline-bottom"><em>Totally New</em></span><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-guest-emma-cline/9780812998627?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Guest</em></a><br><br> by Emma Cline<br><br> Alex, the protagonist of Cline&#39;s second novel, is an escort in her early 20s, desperate to evade paying both her New York City back rent and a menacing ex-boyfriend to whom she owes an apparently hefty sum of money.

The discomfiting yet universal phenomena of aging, being ill, and having your body let you down are Irby&#39;s most reliable subjects, and anaphylaxis, perimenopause, and diarrhea all get their moments in <em>Quietly Hostile</em> , her fourth essay collection. But the book is also a receptacle for her wildest dreams, such as what she would say to Dave Matthews if she could meet him backstage, or a self-indulgent meditation on how she would rewrite original <em>Sex and the City</em> episodes (fueled by her time as a writer on its reboot, <em>And Just Like That</em> ). When she wants to, Irby can evoke grief without blinking: She recounts, for example, her final, painful, conversation with her mother. But her writing about the great transition from being “young and lubricated” to middle-aged is reliably moving in its own way, and consistently hilarious. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/emma-sarappo/">ES</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-wager-a-tale-of-shipwreck-mutiny-and-murder-david-grann/9780385534260?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Wager</em></a><br><br> by David Grann<br><br> The dramatic story of the 18th-century shipwreck of the HMS Wager seems almost ready-made for Grann, the best-selling <em>New Yorker</em> writer famous for dynamic narrative histories, such as his previous book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/killers-of-the-flower-moon-the-osage-murders-and-the-birth-of-the-fbi-david-grann/9780307742483?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>Killers of the Flower Moon</em></a> . When the British ship gets shredded traversing the treacherous waves and rocks of Cape Horn on a quixotic mission to search for and plunder enemy Spanish boats, the survivors find themselves stranded on an island off the coast of Patagonia. What happens next can be neatly summed up by the fact that Grann has used a quotation from <em>Lord of the Flies</em> as part of his epigraph. His dogged search through ships&#39; logs and other contemporaneous accounts of the disaster and its mutinous aftermath has turned up the kind of sterling details that make his writing sing; he is also interested in the way these events were recorded and then recounted, with many different people trying to shape the memory of what happened. Grann simultaneously reconstructs history while telling a tale that is as propulsive and adventure-filled as any potboiler. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/gal-beckerman/">GB</a></em><br><br> <a href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-late-americans-brandon-taylor/9780593332337?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Late Americans</em></a><br><br> by Brandon Taylor<br><br> A small, quiet act “had the indifference of love,” Taylor writes near the end of a chapter in <em>The Late Americans</em> . In this scene, a couple is on the outs; they each seem to feed off of needling the other. Yet even as the relationship fissures, Timo makes sure Fyodor gets home safe, driving behind him as Fyodor walks, unsteadily drunk, through the Iowa City night and back to his cold, blank apartment. Their distant togetherness echoes across the novel, where young poets, pianists, meatpackers, and aspiring investment bankers are clumped on and around a university campus, teetering through graduate courses, financial strain, hapless affairs, and the casual dread of not quite knowing their place in the world. The connections between Taylor&#39;s multiple protagonists seem alternately random, doomed, and deeply romantic—much like the conditions that tie them to their creativity, and that keep them moving elliptically, tenderly, toward coming of age. <em>— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/nicole-acheampong/">Nicole Acheampong</a></em><br><br> Photography Credits from top to bottom: Guy Le Querrec/Magnum; Herb List / Magnum; JK / Magnum Photos; Herb List / Magnum; Clinton Cargill; Donovan Smallwood for <em>The Atlantic</em><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 01 Aug 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/summer-reading-2023/673948/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/summer-reading-2023/673948/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Trump’s Inevitability Problem]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> His apparent stranglehold on the GOP race is both emboldening and hindering. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/pItqRQjM6NijNJzJjGhB2qfety4=/0x312:6000x3687/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_1577576024-1/original.jpg" alt="7 月 28 日，唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 在 2023 年林肯晚宴上向宾客致意。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Scott Olson / Getty</figcaption></figure><small><i>这是</i>《大西洋<i>日报》的一个版本，是一份时事通讯，可引导您了解当天最大的故事，帮助您发现新想法，并推荐最好的文化。</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/"><i>Sign up for it here.</i></a></small><br><br> There&#39;s Donald Trump, and there&#39;s everyone else. At the moment, the former president of the United States appears unbeatable in the 2024 Republican primary race. But perhaps <i>inevitable</i> is a trickier word than it seems.<br><br> First, here are three new stories from <i>The Atlantic</i> :<br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/ukraine-kakhovka-dam-destruction-gallery/674806/">Ukraine after the deluge</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/">The misunderstood reason millions of Americans stopped going to church</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/summer-covid-wave-2023/674863/">One more COVID summer?</a></li> <strong>It&#39;s Iowa Time</strong><br><br> What happens when you say the unsayable? Former Representative (and current GOP presidential contender) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/will-hurd-2024-book/629398/">Will Hurd</a> found out the hard way Friday night. “Donald Trump is not running for president to make America great again,” Hurd told the Republican masses inside the Iowa Events Center. “Donald Trump is running to stay out of prison.”<br><br> The boos rained down, and, rest assured, they were mighty.<br><br> Hurd was one of 13 candidates who had trekked to Des Moines for the Iowa GOP&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/presidential/caucus/2023/07/28/iowa-gop-lincoln-dinner-draws-2024-contenders-to-des-moines-friday/70457582007/">cattle-call event</a> known as the Lincoln Dinner. Prospective voters and donors gathered roughly six months ahead of Iowa&#39;s first-in-the-nation caucus to remind themselves of their importance, which may or may not be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/12/iowa-caucus-democrats-dnc-vote-2024-presidential-primary-election/672444/">waning</a> . The night was ostensibly a chance for Iowans to listen to a range of electability pitches. Former Vice President Mike Pence told the room he would reinstate a ban on transgender personnel in the US military and endorsed the idea of a national abortion restriction after 15 weeks. The businessman Vivek Ramaswamy rattled off a list of government agencies he would shut down: the FBI, CDC, DOE, ATF, and IRS. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis boasted that he had refused to let his state “descend into a Faucian dystopia” during the pandemic and called for term limits in Congress. (One dinner attendee, the 89-year-old Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley—currently serving his eighth term—probably didn&#39;t like that one.)<br><br> The whole spectacle—including the after-parties where you could snap selfies with candidates or, at the DeSantis event, knock down a pyramid of Bud Light cans—felt like a study in performative competition.<br><br> Each speaker was given a democratizing 10-minute time limit to deliver his or her remarks (poor Asa Hutchinson suffered the embarrassment of having his mic cut off), but all were merely warm-up acts for the headliner. When Trump finally took the stage, he seemed tired, bored, and annoyed with this obligation. A lack of teleprompters meant that Trump spent the bulk of his 10 minutes looking down at printed notes, only occasionally making eye contact with the audience or ad-libbing. He got a few chuckles out of his old pandemic go-to, the “China virus.” He notably referred to his White House predecessor as “Barack Hussein Obama.” The only newish development was that Ron “DeSanctimonious” had been shortened to the easier-to-say but far more confusing “DeSanctis.”<br><br> Trump is not running as an incumbent, but it sure seems that way. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/us/politics/2024-poll-nyt-siena-trump-republicans.html"><i>New York Times</i> /Siena College poll out today</a> shows Trump with a 37-point lead over DeSantis, who was the only other candidate able to crack double digits among respondents. Did January 6 matter? Do the indictments matter? Does <i>anything</i> remotely negative about Trump matter?还没有。 Trump remains the Katie Ledecky of the 2024 contest—so far ahead of the pack that it feels wrong to even call it a race. Trump knows it too. He may not even bother to show up at the first Republican debate next month, in Milwaukee.<br><br> These factors would suggest that the Republican Party is delaying the inevitable, that the GOP base earnestly wants to “Make America great again” … again. And yet, the various campaign buses keep on rolling across Iowa and New Hampshire. The noble attempts at retail politics and down-home charm continue apace. Pence strategically name-dropped the Iowa chain Pizza Ranch. Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina tweeted a video of himself fist-pumping after <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/votetimscott/status/1685070929343229952">sinking a bag in cornhole</a> . (“If God made you a man, you play sports against men,” Scott said onstage Friday night.) Expect <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/06/the-secret-presidential-campaign-dress-code/674298/">much more of this</a> at the Iowa State Fair, which kicks off in just over a week.<br><br> I was in the press pen at the Lincoln Dinner on Friday night, and I spent the weekend in Iowa speaking with various Republicans about all things 2024. I came away with the sense that a not-insignificant portion of conservatives is willing to accept Trump&#39;s dominance, but that many are still quietly hoping for a deus ex machina to avoid a 2020 rematch. The still-rolling indictments don&#39;t seem to have much effect—too many Republican voters argue that the legal cases against Trump are politically motivated. He shows no signs of giving up his nickname, “Teflon Don.”<br><br> The fact that Trump is running from a stance of inevitability is paradoxically both emboldening and hindering. Trump doesn&#39;t seem to want to actually be president (as Hurd suggested). Maybe he just wants to prove he can win again. Will that motivational gap matter to voters? Will <i>anything</i> matter?<br><br> <b>Related</b> :<br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/03/will-hurd-2024-book/629398/">The revenge of the normal Republicans</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/06/the-secret-presidential-campaign-dress-code/674298/">The secret presidential-campaign dress code</a></li> <strong>Today&#39;s News</strong><br><br><li> A state judge in Georgia <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/31/us/trump-georgia-prosecutor-election.html">rejected</a> Trump&#39;s bid to derail the investigation into his attempts to overturn election results in the state.</li><li> A <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russian-missile-strike-hits-kryvyi-rih-ukraine-interior-ministry-2023-07-31/">Russian missile strike</a> on Kryvyi Rih, President Volodymyr Zelensky&#39;s hometown, killed at least six people, including a 10-year-old girl and her mother, and wounded dozens more.</li><li> The Islamic State <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/pakistan-suicide-bombing-death-toll-rises-45-2023-07-31/">claimed responsibility</a> for Sunday&#39;s suicide bombing of a political rally in Pakistan that killed at least 54 people.</li> <strong>Dispatches</strong><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/the-wonder-reader/"><b>The Wonder Reader</b></a> <b>:</b> In 1980, the film critic Roger Ebert argued that movies were better in theaters.

Having one parent with myopia doubles the odds that a kid will need glasses. Having two parents with myopia quintuples them. Over the years, she did indeed diagnose lots of nearsighted kids with nearsighted parents. These parents, she told me, would sigh in recognition: <i>Oh no, not them too.</i> But something was changing.</p> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/10/kids-glasses-vision-increased-nearsightedness-myopia/671244/">阅读全文。</a><br><br> <b>More From <em>The Atlantic</em></b><br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/fitboxing-classes-sparring-noncontact/674869/">What “fitboxing” is missing</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/speaking-ukrainian-russian-language/674860/">“Ukrainian is my native language, but I had to learn it.”</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/twitter-alternatives-bluesky-mastodon-threads/674859/">The weird, fragmented world of social media after Twitter</a></li><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/ups-strike-union-contract-package-deliveries/674864/">America is drowning in packages.</a></li> <b>Culture Break</b><br><br> <b>Read.</b> “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/poem-michael-white-i-wish-i-could-remember/674867/">I Wish I Could Remember</a> ,” a new poem by Michael White.<br><br> “ <i>It&#39;s just a dream</i> , / I&#39;d tell myself.

So does the internet. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/t7BDtYVKp8MpaERxjMGJdYeYExo=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/twitter_final/original.jpg" alt="蓝色鸟舍的照片插图，上面画有黑色“X”" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic. Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> I woke up Sunday to find I had begun using the social network formerly known as Twitter. The app had updated to show the new name chosen by its owner: X. Now, underneath the friendly and familiar blue icon with a white bird, that letter alone was displayed— <em>X</em> —as if my iPhone was affirming that Elon Musk&#39;s Twitter had become an error. Soon after, the bird icon disappeared, too, in favor of a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90927535/elon-musk-twitter-logo">white-on-black 𝕏</a> .<br><br> The change has rolled out slowly. First the website rebranded, and then, by the end of last week, Musk had dismantled the Twitter signage on the company&#39;s San Francisco headquarters and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/twitter-san-francisco-building-x-elon-musk-4e0ae2a3b1b838b744bb2dc494f5b23c">erected a huge, glowing <em>X</em></a> on its rooftop. (It has since been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abc7news.com/twitter-x-sign-taken-down-bright-light-sf/13578182/">taken down</a> .) Reprising the creeper thinking that inspired Musk to name Tesla&#39;s models the “S,” “3,” “X,” and “Y,” such that they would combine to spell “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://electrek.co/2016/07/30/tesla-vehicle-naming-convention-sexy-model-y-elon-musk/">S3XY</a> ,” Twitter also reportedly gave several conference rooms new, <em>X</em> -oriented names, including “eXposure” and, once again, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/technology/twitter-x-elon-musk.html">s3Xy</a> .”<br><br> As my colleague Charlie Warzel <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-musk-x-rebrand/674818/">explained last week</a> , Musk has been trying to make X happen for decades now; PayPal arose from a merger with his X.com website. Now he&#39;d like for X to be a superapp, a platform for chat, banking, news, shopping—everything. Musk&#39;s insistence on packaging that idea, already megalomaniacal, with a logo that resembles a nerdy middle-school boy&#39;s notebook doodle underscores a difficult truth: Nerdy middle-school boyhood, once a phase to be outgrown, has become a philosophy of life. “Anyone else look at the 𝕏 icon and not even want to open this app?” the Chicago-based product designer Chad Ashley tweeted—err, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/cgpov/status/1685616291703410688">posted on X</a> . He&#39;s right. It&#39;s embarrassing.<br><br> Maybe that&#39;s for the best. As a cultural practice, social media is bad— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/fix-facebook-making-it-more-like-google/620456/">people aren&#39;t meant to talk to one another this much</a> —and anything that might erode the practice is worthwhile. But also, Twitter, like other social platforms and the very internet itself, is already redolent of the seventh grader&#39;s mindset that Musk&#39;s behavior betrays. Maybe we should be grateful that his X fetish forces us to admit that truth, so we can someday move beyond it.<br><br> In its un-rebranded form, Twitter helped make the lifestyle of posting seem benign. Before it was a company (and then an online addiction), <em>twitter</em> was just a word: a reference to the sound of birds or certain kinds of human prattle. What harm could come of that?<br><br> Lots. For starters, it normalized the very notion of a platform where everyone can speak to everyone, all at once. This feels natural today, but it wasn&#39;t when the service launched in 2006. Back then, some might have had a blog, but people ordinarily posted only to small, closed online networks. That&#39;s how Facebook still worked, and LinkedIn too, and Orkut, may it rest in peace. Social networks were initially designed around communities of trust. Twitter and then Instagram are to blame for expanding the act of posting to the world.<br><br> The shift from social networks to social media was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/">culturally destructive</a> . It set the expectation that everyone deserves—is owed, even—an audience for their every notion, quip, photo, or activity. This is a selfish child&#39;s idea of living in the world, now so commonplace that opposing it seems controversial.<br><br> That ethos has consequences. The rise of public shaming online, whether <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html?_r=0">in response to jokes</a> , to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2016/02/the-evolution-of-shaming/470544/">affirm personal virtue</a> , or to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/05/best-shaming-happens-private/612082/">deepen group membership</a> , was dependent on an infrastructure of public data from which shameworthiness could be assessed, and also on the viral spread that Twitter both invented and perfected. So was the spread of QAnon, and the planning for the January 6 insurgency. The ability to repost something instantly and without comment to one&#39;s own network, first invented as the “retweet button” in 2009, became a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alexkantrowitz/how-the-retweet-ruined-the-internet">vector for harassment and misinformation</a> , allowing messages true or false, virtuous or vicious, to reach far beyond their original environments. Every other platform adopted a version of this feature because of its ability to produce engagement, and now imagining social media without it is almost impossible.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/11/twitter-facebook-social-media-decline/672074/">Read: The age of social media is ending</a><br><br> Those are influences of function—many frequently acknowledged. Less discussed: Twitter and the services it influenced also changed aesthetic life. They brought a new style to the fore: juvenile narcissism. X is its purest, dumbest distillation, a seemingly edgy but ultimately corny name that evokes mathematics and nightclubs, pornography and tabletop games.<br><br> Like many styles, Musk&#39;s (and Twitter&#39;s) came out of a subculture, and one that thrives online. The infinity of social media creates communities at the fringe. In the best cases, these improve the lives of people who might otherwise struggle for connection, but they can also serve as bubbles that amplify and normalize perversion. When everyone can find a group of like-minded individuals, all flavors of mindedness can end up seeming justified—including, most of all, the weird-schoolboy-mindedness of the people who happen to have invented the internet as we know it.<br><br> Online culture began in corners where weirdos could connect. Dialed into local <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/">BBSes</a> , or logged on to Usenet threads and text-based virtual worlds called MUDs, nerds and outcasts were the first to find their tribes online. Some shared recipes or crochet patterns; others expressed their board-game, anime, or furry fandoms; while still others passed around conspiracy theories. And there were always piles and piles of naked pictures.<br><br> Across many of these communities, no matter their host, content, or members, an ethos of dorky behavior was ascendant—and it persists today. You can&#39;t browse a subreddit for plumbing or coffee-brewing tips without running the risk of wading through a hundred nested replies containing dumb jokes, sneers, and sexual innuendo. Bizarre beliefs that once would have been confined to email forwards became widespread on Facebook. Every tweet becomes an opportunity for some miscreant, mansplainer, or literalist to pick your words apart. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Comic_Book_Guy">Comic Book Guys</a> took over.<br><br> Sexual desire and frustration, familiar feelings for the outcast teenage nerd, pervade the social internet. S3xy-ness is everywhere. Posts by women are dismayingly likely to produce advances, or threats, from creepers on all platforms; at the same time, sex appeal is a pillar for the influencer economy, or else a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/style/onlyfans-porn-stars.html">viable</a> and even noble way to win financial independence. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-internet-is-for-porn">The internet is for porn</a> , as the song goes.<br><br> In all these ways, online life today descends from where it started, as a safe harbor for the computer nerds who made it. They were socially awkward, concerned with machines instead of people, and devoted to the fantasy of converting their impotence into power.

He had been married for more than 20 years to his ex-wife, and they have a kid together. I have heard about many of his former girlfriends before his first marriage, and I know he had one girlfriend after his marriage ended and prior to dating me.<br><br> He also has a best friend, a man who lives next door to us. A few weeks after our wedding, I was looking for a place in the filing cabinet to stash some papers I&#39;d brought from my prior home, and I saw a paper stuck in the roller wheel. It said “[name of his best friend] loves [my husband&#39;s name].” I wanted to find out what this was about, so I invaded his privacy. I found many cards and love notes from this friend to my husband dated about 12 years prior to our wedding.<br><br> I cried and was in shock. I spoke with my husband, and he said that after his divorce from his wife of two decades, he was hurt. He didn&#39;t want a woman but wanted a companion. I found out that he spoke with several men during that time frame—about four years—until he fought to overcome his feelings. He made his best friend move out of his house, but the friend still lives next door to us, on my husband&#39;s family&#39;s property. I have to be reminded every day of what went on between them. They had sex when they were together, and now when I look at the two of them, that&#39;s all I can envision.<br><br> I know it was about 10 years before I came into the picture, but I&#39;m bitter. My husband says he has no romantic feelings for his friend at all anymore. My husband is an only child, and he says this best friend is like a brother.<br><br> This all bothers me so much. It&#39;s been over a year since I found out, and I still can&#39;t seem to accept my husband. What can I do to get over this? My husband is loving and kind to everyone. He is good to me and my daughter and loves family, both his and mine. But I keep seeing his past mistake. He says it&#39;s his past, and happened before I came along. Still, being reminded daily is hard.<br><br> <strong>Anonymous</strong><br><br> <strong>Dear Anonymous,</strong><br><br> One of the most jarring experiences in a relationship is learning that something is not as it seemed. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/02/how-to-tell-child-sperm-donor/673194/">discovery of a secret</a> can leave you reevaluating everything you thought you knew about your partner, and make you question both your sense of reality and the trust you thought you shared.<br><br> For you, there&#39;s the added layer that two secrets were revealed at once. First, that your husband&#39;s closest friend is also his ex. Second, that your husband has had relationships with men. And although both facts have left you feeling confused and betrayed, it will be important for you to consider your reaction to each of these discoveries separately in order to figure out how to move forward and heal from these deceptions.<br><br> On the first point, your husband had a romantic relationship with the person you knew only as his best friend, and you&#39;re reeling from a lie of omission. Putting gender aside for a moment (because we&#39;ll discuss that next), you weren&#39;t told that someone very close to him and present in both of your lives as your next-door neighbor has a sexual history with your husband. This isn&#39;t a “Whoops, I forgot to mention it” oversight, but a deliberate attempt to prevent you from finding out. I say that gender isn&#39;t the issue here because even if this person were a woman, I imagine you would feel betrayed had you not been told that his closest friend who also lives on your shared property is also his ex.<br><br> It makes sense that you feel bitter after your trust has been breached. And although you had a conversation about what you discovered and your husband came clean about his history, more has to be done to repair the damage from his dishonesty. For instance, has he shared with you why he didn&#39;t tell you about his romantic involvement with his best friend, and what steps he will take to be honest in the future? Has he taken full responsibility for keeping this from you, regardless of his reason? (There&#39;s a difference between “Yes, I lied, but it was because of X” and “I lied because of X, but regardless, I never should have lied, and I&#39;m committed to being honest with you in the future.”) Have you shared with him how untethered his holding of this secret makes you feel as you begin your marriage together, and what your expectations are, going forward, regarding honesty?<br><br> When you have conversations like this, you&#39;ll need to listen from a place of curiosity and compassion, which doesn&#39;t mean that you aren&#39;t holding him accountable for deceiving you. Instead, you&#39;re creating an environment that can incubate more trust between you. He might, for example, say that he was afraid to tell you because he believed you would feel threatened by the daily presence of an ex and want him to end a friendship that&#39;s very important to him, and he felt stuck between disclosure and losing his best friend. He might say he was worried that if you knew he was attracted to men, you might reject him or even leave him (and given your reaction, he could have been right). In turn, you might tell him that his hiding relevant information about an ex with whom he interacts regularly has left you wondering what else he might be hiding, and questioning whether you can trust him: Has he shared the full extent of their past and current relationship? Are there other secrets unrelated to this person that he&#39;s still hiding?<br><br> As you talk, make sure you&#39;re being completely honest not just with him, but also with yourself. You will need to reflect on what will make you feel safe in the years ahead and communicate that to him. This might include a full accounting of his relationship with his best friend so that more aspects of the story don&#39;t come out later, his sharing any outstanding lies of omission with you now so there are no more surprises (you might frame this as “If there&#39;s anything that I will want to know, now is the time to tell me, because telling me later will likely make it impossible for me to trust you again or stay with you”), and going to couples therapy to work through this together. These are just suggestions—you will have to decide what you truly need, and ask for that.<br><br> You might also discuss your feelings about the current living arrangements. What might not have been a problem had there been no secret to begin with could be a problem now, because your trust has been fractured. Perhaps you&#39;re comfortable with their continuing friendship but would prefer that the ex not live next door, or maybe you&#39;re fine with this proximity given how long ago they were romantically involved. Something to think about as you answer this question is what you mean when you say that “being reminded daily” of your husband&#39;s ex is hard. Which reminder is hard for you: that he had a romantic past with an ex who&#39;s in your lives, that he deceived you about it, or that the ex is a man?<br><br> This brings me to the second secret—your husband&#39;s attraction to men—which seems more complicated for both of you. Neither you nor your husband appears comfortable with his sexuality. You say “he fought to overcome his feelings” after dating the ex and talking with several men over a four-year period, which indicates shame or denial on his part, and your disapproval and judgment come across in your calling his dating a man “his past mistake”—something you don&#39;t say about any of his former girlfriends. You each seem reluctant to acknowledge that your husband has been attracted to both men and women, and you&#39;ll need to examine what your husband&#39;s sexuality brings up for both of you so that these feelings don&#39;t contribute to more secrecy.<br><br> You might start by exploring why you “can&#39;t seem to accept” him and clarifying any misconceptions or assumptions you have about bisexuality. Maybe you believe that it means he will always miss being with men and therefore might cheat on you—which is not how sexual attraction works. Just as you will always be attracted to other people, so will he; the key is that neither of you will act on those desires if you both choose to be in a monogamous relationship. You can ask him to share with you what his experience is as someone attracted to both men and women so that he can clarify what his sexuality means for him. You can talk about your respective histories with cultural or family stigma regarding same-sex partnerships, and how those views might evolve so that there&#39;s space for your husband to be loved fully by you as his authentic self—a man who seems to be attracted to both men and women, and who is in a monogamous marriage. If you force his authentic self into hiding, you will be encouraging more secrecy and causing your husband to feel shame for who he is. You might need to spend some time trying to understand (perhaps with the help of a therapist) how it is that the man you love and are attracted to becomes someone else in your mind—someone you view with aversion—because he has a history with partners of his own gender.<br><br> Sometimes we don&#39;t talk about the very thing we need to discuss most, because once a truth is acknowledged, we can&#39;t un-acknowledge it. Right now you&#39;re both acting as if your husband isn&#39;t attracted to men, and wasn&#39;t even when he was having sex with one (instead, you write that he wanted “a companion” while reeling from a divorce). If you want a marriage based on honesty, avoiding the truth won&#39;t be helpful.<br><br> Here&#39;s that truth: Your husband&#39;s romantic past is part of who he is, just as yours is part of who you are. We all want to bring our full self into a marriage, and to be loved and accepted for who we really are. Now that the secrets are out, instead of denying what they mean about the person you married, embrace the truth together, in all of its complexity and discomfort, so that you can build this new marriage with the trust and openness you desire.<br><br> <em>Dear Therapist is for informational purposes only, does not constitute medical advice, and is not a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.

Will it always be like this? <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ho_TtxSm1W41SD_VW5hNZB-_8Eo=/1x0:965x542/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/SummerCovid2/original.gif" alt="冠状病毒粒子的动画，太阳和云在其内部移动" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Paul Spella / The Atlantic; Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> Since the pandemic&#39;s earliest days, epidemiologists have been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/covid-seasonal-winter/620766/">waiting</a> for the coronavirus to finally snap out of its pan-season spree. No more spring waves like the first to hit the United States in 2020, no more mid-year surges like the one that turned Hot Vax Summer on its head. Eventually, or so the hope went, SARS-CoV-2 would adhere to the same calendar that many other airway pathogens stick to, at least in temperate parts of the globe: a heavy winter peak, then a summer on sabbatical.<br><br> But three and a half years into the outbreak, the coronavirus is still stubbornly refusing to take the warmest months off. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://yourlocalepidemiologist.substack.com/p/covid-19-catch-up-quick">Some</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://caitlinrivers.substack.com/p/this-week-in-outbreaks-july-28-edition">public-health experts</a> are now worried that, after a relatively quiet stretch, the virus is kick-starting yet another summer wave. In the southern and northeastern United States, concentrations of the coronavirus in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://biobot.io/data/">wastewater</a> have been slowly ticking up for several weeks, with the Midwest and West now following suit; test-positivity rates, emergency-department diagnoses of COVID-19, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#maps_new-admissions-rate-county">COVID hospitalizations</a> are also on the rise. The absolute numbers are still small, and they may stay that way. But these are the clear and early signs of a brewing mid-year wave, says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University—which would make this the fourth summer in a row with a distinct coronavirus bump.<br><br> Even this far into the pandemic, though, no one can say for certain whether summer waves are a permanent COVID fixture—or if the virus exhibits a predictable seasonal pattern at all. No law of nature dictates that winters must come with respiratory illness, or that summers will not. “We just don&#39;t know very much about what drives the cyclical patterns of respiratory infections,” says Sam Scarpino, an infectious-disease modeler at Northeastern University. Which means there&#39;s still no part of the year when this virus is guaranteed to cut us any slack.<br><br> That many pathogens <em>do</em> wax and wane with the seasons is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1007327">indisputable</a> . In temperate parts of the world, airborne bugs get a boost in winter, only to be stifled in the heat; polio and other feces-borne pathogens, meanwhile, often rise in summer, along with gonorrhea and some other STIs. But noticing these trends is one thing; truly understanding the triggers is another.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/11/covid-seasonal-winter/620766/">Read: COVID sure looks seasonal now</a><br><br> Some diseases lend themselves a bit more easily to explanation: Near the equator, waves of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5963813/">mosquito-borne illness</a> , such as Zika and Chikungunya, tend to be tied to the weather-dependent life cycles of the insects that carry them; in temperate parts of the world, rates of Lyme disease track with the summertime activity of ticks. Flu, too, has pretty strong data to back its preference for wintry months. The virus—which is sheathed in a fragile, fatty layer called an envelope and travels airborne via moist drops—spreads best when it&#39;s cool and dry, conditions that may help keep infectious particles <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.03452-22">intact</a> and spittle aloft.<br><br> The coronavirus has enough similarities to flu that most experts expect that it will continue to spread in winter too. Both viruses are housed in a sensitive skin; both prefer to move by aerosol. Both are also relatively speedy evolvers that don&#39;t tend to generate long-lasting immunity against infection—factors conducive to repeat waves that hit populations at a fairly stable clip. For those reasons, Anice Lowen, a virologist at Emory University, anticipates that SARS-CoV-2 will continue to show “a clear wintertime seasonality in temperate regions of the world.” Winter is also a time when our bodies can be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-virology-012420-022445">more susceptible</a> to respiratory bugs: Cold, dry air can interfere with the movement of mucus that shuttles microbes out of the nose and throat; aridity can also make the cells that line those passageways shrivel and die; certain immune defenses might get a bit sleepier, with vitamin D in shorter supply.<br><br> None of that precludes SARS-CoV-2 spread in the heat, even if experts aren&#39;t sure why the virus so easily drives summer waves. Plenty of other microbes manage it: enteroviruses, polio, and more. Even rhinoviruses and adenoviruses, two of the most frequent causes of colds, tend to spread year-round, sometimes showing up in force during the year&#39;s hottest months. (Many scientists presume that has something to do with these viruses&#39; relatively hardy outer layer, but the reason is undoubtedly more complex than that.) An oft-touted explanation for COVID&#39;s summer waves is that people in certain parts of the country retreat indoors to beat the heat. But that argument alone “is weak,” Lowen told me. In industrialized nations, people <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cpsc.gov/safety-education/safety-guides/home/indoor-air-pollution-introduction-health-professionals">spend more than 90 percent of their time indoors</a> .<br><br> That said, an accumulation of many small influences can together create a seasonal tipping point. Summer <em>is</em> a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://aytm.com/post/vacations-survey">particularly popular time</a> for travel, often to big gatherings. Many months out from winter and its numerous infections and vaccinations, population immunity might also be at a relative low at this time of year, Rivers said. Plus, for all its similarities to the flu, SARS-CoV-2 is its own beast: It has so far affected people more chronically and more <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/12/covid-common-cold-status-differentiation/672472/">severely</a> , and has generated population-sweeping variants at a far faster pace. Those dynamics can all affect when waves manifest.<br><br> And although certain bodily defenses do dip in the cold, data don&#39;t support the idea that immunity is unilaterally stronger in the summer. Micaela Martinez, the director of environmental health at WE ACT for Environmental Justice, in New York, told me the situation is far more complicated than that. For years, she and other researchers have been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8987173/">gathering</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33817568/">evidence</a> that suggests that our bodies have distinctly seasonal immunological profiles—with some defensive molecules spiking in the summer and another set in winter. The consequences of those shifts aren&#39;t yet apparent. But some of them could help explain when the coronavirus spreads. By the same token, winter is not a time of disease-ridden doom. Xaquin Castro Dopico, an immunologist at the Karolinska Institute, in Sweden, has found that immune systems in the Northern Hemisphere might be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25965853/">more inflammation-prone in the winter</a> —which, yes, could make certain bouts of illness more severe but could also improve <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19889749/">responses</a> to certain vaccinations.<br><br> All of those explanations could apply to COVID&#39;s summer swings—or perhaps none does. “Everybody always wants to have a very simple seasonal answer,” Martinez told me. But one may simply not exist. Even the reasons for the seasonality of polio, a staunch <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4474890/">summertime</a> disease prior to its elimination in the US, have been “an open question” for many decades, Martinez told me.<br><br> Rivers is hopeful that the coronavirus&#39;s permanent patterns may already be starting to peek through: a wintry heyday, and a smaller maybe-summer hump. “We&#39;re in year four, and we&#39;re seeing the same thing year over year,” she told me. But some experts worry that discussions of COVID-19 seasonality are premature. SARS-CoV-2 is still so fresh to the human population that its patterns <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/03/kids-babies-getting-covid-exposure-vaccines/673368/">could be far from their final form</a> . At an extreme, the patterns researchers observed during the first few years of the pandemic may not prelude the future much at all, because they encapsulate so much change: the initial lack and rapid acquisition of immunity, the virus&#39;s evolution, the ebb and flow of masks, and more. Amid that mishmash of countervailing influences, says Brandon Ogbunu, an infectious-disease modeler at Yale, “you&#39;re going to get some counterintuitive dynamics” that won&#39;t necessarily last long term.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/03/kids-babies-getting-covid-exposure-vaccines/673368/">Read: The next stage of COVID is starting now</a><br><br><br> With <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.healthdata.org/sites/default/files/files/1_briefing_Global_6.pdf">so much of the world</a> now infected, vaccinated, or both, and COVID mitigations almost entirely gone, the global situation is less in flux now. The virus itself, although still clearly changing at a blistering pace, has not pulled off an Omicron-caliber jump in evolution for more than a year and a half. But no one can yet promise predictability. The cadence of vaccination isn&#39;t yet settled; Scarpino, of Northeastern University, also isn&#39;t ready to dismiss the idea of a viral evolution surprise. Maybe summer waves, to the extent that they&#39;re happening, are a sign that SARS-CoV-2 will remain a microbe for all seasons. Or maybe they&#39;re part of the pandemic&#39;s death rattle—noise in a system that hasn&#39;t yet quieted down.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 29 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/summer-covid-wave-2023/674863/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/summer-covid-wave-2023/674863/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Misunderstood Reason Millions of Americans Stopped Going to Church]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The defining problem driving people out is ... just how American life works in the 21st century. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/SNLWHQRKMYXKJeLjdVhRTWLZR4Q=/0x312:3000x2000/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_455600083/original.jpg" alt="长凳上放着一本圣经。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Spencer Platt / Getty</figcaption></figure> Nearly everyone I grew up with in my childhood church in Lincoln, Nebraska, is no longer Christian. That&#39;s not unusual. Forty million Americans have stopped attending church in the past 25 years. That&#39;s something like 12 percent of the population, and it represents the largest concentrated change in church attendance in American history. As a Christian, I feel this shift acutely. My wife and I wonder whether the institutions and communities that have helped preserve us in our own faith will still exist for our four children, let alone whatever grandkids we might one day have.<br><br> This change is also bad news for America as a whole: Participation in a religious community generally correlates with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/10/28/religion-church-attendance-mortality-column/92676964/">better health outcomes and longer life</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.philanthropyroundtable.org/magazine/less-god-less-giving/">higher financial generosity</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thepublicdiscourse.com/2018/03/20935/">more stable families</a> —all of which are desperately needed in a nation with rising rates of loneliness, mental illness, and alcohol and drug dependency.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/christianity-secularization-america-renewal-modernity/672948/">Timothy Keller: American Christianity is due for a revival</a><br><br> A new book, written by Jim Davis, a pastor at an evangelical church in Orlando, and Michael Graham, a writer with the Gospel Coalition, draws on surveys of more than 7,000 Americans by the political scientists Ryan Burge and Paul Djupe, attempting to explain why people have left churches—or “dechurched,” in the book&#39;s lingo—and what, if anything, can be done to get some people to come back. The book raises an intriguing possibility: What if the problem isn&#39;t that churches are asking too much of their members, but that they aren&#39;t asking nearly enough?<br><br> <i>The Great Dechurching</i> finds that religious abuse and more general moral corruption in churches have driven people away. This is, of course, an indictment of the failures of many leaders who did not address abuse in their church. But Davis and Graham also find that a much larger share of those who have left church have done so for more banal reasons. The book suggests that the defining problem driving out most people who leave is … just how American life works in the 21st century. Contemporary America simply isn&#39;t set up to promote mutuality, care, or common life. Rather, it is designed to maximize individual accomplishment as defined by professional and financial success. Such a system leaves precious little time or energy for forms of community that don&#39;t contribute to one&#39;s own professional life or, as one ages, the professional prospects of one&#39;s children. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/">Workism</a> reigns in America, and because of it, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2023/05/03/new-surgeon-general-advisory-raises-alarm-about-devastating-impact-epidemic-loneliness-isolation-united-states.html">community in America</a> , religious community included, is a math problem that doesn&#39;t add up.<br><br> Numerous victims of abuse in church environments can identify a moment when they lost the ability to believe, when they almost felt their faith draining out of them. The book shows, though, that for most Americans who were once a part of churches but have since left, the process of leaving was gradual, and in many cases they didn&#39;t realize it was even happening until it already had. It&#39;s less like jumping off a cliff and more like driving down a slope, eventually realizing that you can no longer see the place you started from.<br><br> Consider one of the composite characters that Graham and Davis use in the book to describe a typical evangelical dechurcher: a 30-something woman who grew up in a suburban megachurch, was heavily invested in a campus ministry while in college, then after graduating moved into a full-time job and began attending a young-adults group in a local church. In her 20s, she meets a guy who is less religiously engaged, they get married, and, at some point early in their marriage, after their first or second child is born, they stop going to church. Maybe the baby isn&#39;t sleeping well and when Sunday morning comes around, it is simply easier to stay home and catch whatever sleep is available as the baby (finally) falls asleep.<br><br> In other cases, a person might be entering mid-career, working a high-stress job requiring a 60- or 70-hour workweek. Add to that 15 hours of commute time, and suddenly something like two-thirds of their waking hours in the week are already accounted for. And so when a friend invites them to a Sunday-morning brunch, they probably want to go to church, but they also want to see that friend, because they haven&#39;t been able to see them for months. The friend wins out.<br><br> After a few weeks of either scenario, the thought of going to church on Sunday carries a certain mental burden with it—you might <i>want</i> to go, but you also dread the inevitable questions about where you have been. “I skipped church to go to brunch with a friend” or “I was just too tired to come” don&#39;t sound like convincing excuses as you rehearse the conversation in your mind. Soon it actually sounds like it&#39;d be harder to attend than to skip, even if some part of you still wants to go. The underlying challenge for many is that their lives are stretched like a rubber band about to snap—and church attendance ends up feeling like an item on a checklist that&#39;s already too long.<br><br> What can churches do in such a context? In theory, the Christian Church could be an antidote to all that. What is more needed in our time than a community marked by sincere love, sharing what they have from each according to their ability and to each according to their need, eating together regularly, generously serving neighbors, and living lives of quiet virtue and prayer? A healthy church can be a safety net in the harsh American economy by offering its members material assistance in times of need: meals after a baby is born, money for rent after a layoff. Perhaps more important, it reminds people that their identity is not in their job or how much money they make; they are children of God, loved and protected and infinitely valuable.<br><br> But a vibrant, life-giving church requires more, not less, time and energy from its members. It asks people to prioritize one another over our career, to prioritize prayer and time reading scripture over accomplishment. This may seem like a tough sell in an era of dechurching. If people are already leaving—especially if they are leaving because they feel too busy and burned out to attend church regularly—why would they want to be part of a church that asks so much of them?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/us-religious-affiliation-rates-declining/672729/">Read: American religion is not dead yet</a><br><br> Although understandable, that isn&#39;t quite the right question. The problem in front of us is not that we have a healthy, sustainable society that doesn&#39;t have room for church. The problem is that many Americans have adopted a way of life that has left us lonely, anxious, and uncertain of how to live in community with other people.<br><br> The tragedy of American churches is that they have been so caught up in this same world that we now find they have nothing to offer these suffering people that can&#39;t be more easily found somewhere else. American churches have too often been content to function as a kind of vaguely spiritual NGO, an organization of detached individuals who meet together for religious services that inspire them, provide practical life advice, or offer positive emotional experiences. Too often it has not been a community that through its preaching and living bears witness to another way to live.<br><br> The theologian Stanley Hauerwas <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.christiancentury.org/article/interview/dangers-providing-pastoral-care">captured the problem well</a> when he said that “pastoral care has become obsessed with the personal wounds of people in advanced industrial societies who have discovered that their lives lack meaning.” The difficulty is that many of the wounds and aches provoked by our current order aren&#39;t of a sort that can be managed or life-hacked away. They are resolved only by changing one&#39;s life, by becoming a radically different sort of person belonging to a radically different sort of community.<br><br> Last fall, I spent several days in New York City, during which time I visited a home owned by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bruderhof.com/">a group of pacifist Christians</a> that lives from a common purse—meaning the members do not have privately held property but share their property and money. Their simple life and shared finances allow their schedules to be more flexible, making for a thicker immediate community and greater generosity to neighbors, as well as a richer life of prayer and private devotion to God, all supported by a deep commitment to their church.<br><br> This is, admittedly, an extreme example. But this community was thriving not because it found ways to scale down what it asked of its members but because it found a way to scale up what they provided to one another. Their way of living frees them from the treadmill of workism. Work, in this community, is judged not by the money it generates but by the people it serves. In a workist culture that believes <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mereorthodoxy.com/dignity-beyond-accomplishment">dignity is grounded in accomplishment</a> , simply reclaiming this alternative form of dignity becomes a radical act.<br><br> In the Gospels, Jesus tells his first disciples to leave their old way of life behind, going so far as abandoning their plow or fishing nets where they are and, if necessary, even leaving behind their parents. A church that doesn&#39;t expect at least this much from one another isn&#39;t really a church in the way Jesus spoke about it. If Graham and Davis are right, it also is likely a church that won&#39;t survive the challenges facing us today.<br><br> The great dechurching could be the beginning of a new moment for churches, a moment marked less by aspiration to respectability and success, with less focus on individuals aligning themselves with American values and assumptions. We could be a witness to another way of life outside conventionally American measures of success. Churches could model better, truer sorts of communities, ones in which the hungry are fed, the weak are lifted up, and the proud are cast down. Such communities might not have the money, success, and influence that many American churches have so often pursued in recent years. But if such communities look less like those churches, they might also look more like the sorts of communities Jesus expected his followers to create.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 29 Jul 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/</item><item><title><![CDATA[Barbie Is Everything.

Speculation abounded as to why Musk would trade a well-known brand for a letter typically associated with rejection and porn: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-rebrand-paypall-x-sounded-like-porn-site-twitter-2023-7">spite</a> , maybe. Or maybe—the most absurd theory, and therefore the most likely—the man who had named his car models “S,” “3,” “X,” and “Y” was doing it, once again, for the lols. Soon after Twitter became X, employees <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/24/technology/twitter-x-elon-musk.html">reported</a> , the conference rooms of its headquarters were rechristened. The staffers Musk hasn&#39;t yet fired can now plan the future of democratized conversation from a meeting room named “s3Xy.”<br><br> X was released, as it happened, the same weekend that the Barbie movie was. The coincidence was eloquent. <em>Barbie</em> is a film about its namesake, definitely, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/">an exploration of impossible womanhood</a> . But it is also a film about Ken—a Ken who, in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-greta-gerwig-interview/674817/">director Greta Gerwig&#39;s rendering</a> , sheds his status as Barbie&#39;s bland accessory to become … a power-addled man-child determined to turn the world into his plaything. No element of <em>Barbie</em> ’s aggressive marketing campaign could have bought the relevance created by a 52-year-old tech titan who, when he is not moving fast and/or breaking things, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musks-humor-jokes-over-years-titter-420-69-2023-4">amuses himself</a> by finding new ways to write “69” into the public record.<br><br> Americans live under gerontocracy, many pundits have argued: Too many of our leaders, having tasted power and then spent decades consolidating it, refuse to cede their spoils to anybody else. The broader truth is even more lamentable, though, because it involves leaders who, unable to contend with power&#39;s responsibilities, treat our future as their toy. Musk and Mark Zuckerberg have spent weeks fueling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/01/technology/elon-musk-mark-zuckerberg-cage-match.html">speculation</a> that they will settle their business differences by way of a televised cage match. Americans gave our nuclear codes to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/10/infantilization-of-a-president/542613/">a Brioni-swaddled toddler</a> . We may well <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/trump-2024-election-republican-primary-nomination-opponents/673882/">do it again</a> . We live in the thrall of impetuous boy-kings. No fictional figure has captured the absurdity of that situation, and the tragedy of it, better than a doll who looks like a man but inflicts himself on the world with a boy&#39;s impish glee. Ken demands attention. He throws tantrums. He sows chaos. He threatens the whole order of things. He is the plastic core of <em>Barbie</em> ’s world—and a bleached-blond satire of ours.<br><br> Barbie Land is, allegedly, a place of childish dreams, safe and happy and sterile and pink. “Girl power,” in the land of the dolls, is not a well-lit lie; it is, on the contrary, the only truth that exists—the scaffolding that supports every wall-less Dream House. It shapes not only the Barbies&#39; professional lives (President Barbie, Physicist Barbie, Doctor Barbie) but also their sense of the world they occupy. The Barbies are self-confident and self-actualized and just generally delighted, and of course they are: They have never had reason to be otherwise. In Barbie Land, the Barbies are fond of reminding themselves that every day is “the best day ever.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-review-greta-gerwig/674742/">Read: What&#39;s the matter with Barbie?</a><br><br> There are Kens in Barbie Land, but they are, like the doll himself, variously decorative and superfluous. Where do the Kens live? What Dream Cars do they drive? Such questions are moot. In a place that treats possessions as proxies for personal fulfillment, the Kens seem to have none. Nor, in a society that equates profession with identity, do they have apparent careers. The Kens do have a job, though: to serve as reliable extras in the Barbies&#39; shiny show. The Kens are there when they&#39;re needed. They&#39;re cheerful. They&#39;re patient. They&#39;re always ready to don sequins and smiles for an intricately choreographed dance number. They are, like pretty much everything else in Barbie Land, aggressively uncomplicated. They are also, as a result, extremely boring.<br><br> Except, that is, for one of them: the Ken who is paired, per the two-by-two logic of Barbie Land, with Stereotypical Barbie. This Ken, played—inhabited—by Ryan Gosling, chafes against his class status. Barbie Land may look like a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://collider.com/themyscira-wonder-woman-series-paradise-lost/">Paradise Island</a> –style matriarchy whose Amazons are 11 inches tall and molded of polyvinyl chloride; Ken, though, is a reminder of the brute limits of its utopia. The film&#39;s most obvious problem comes early on, when Stereotypical Barbie (Margot Robbie) finds herself afflicted by the assorted insults of the human condition (imperfectly browned toast, thoughts of death, cellulite). But Barbie Land&#39;s prefab perfections were imperfect well before Barbie&#39;s crisis. Ken bears the brunt of its errors. He is not merely Barbie&#39;s plaything; he is also the recipient of her casual cruelty. “You can go now,” Barbie tells him, flashing a smile as his face falls. Later: “I don&#39;t want you here.”<br><br> These are the types of lines that have earned <em>Barbie</em> , in the days since its release, some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nypost.com/2023/07/24/if-i-made-a-movie-that-treated-women-the-way-barbie-treats-men-feminists-would-want-me-executed/">indignant</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tmz.com/2023/07/22/barbie-attacked-right-wingers-anti-man-feminist-trash/">accusations</a> of man-hating and sexism and “toxic femininity.” What the criticisms miss, though—or perhaps ignore—is that irony might be present even in a film about toys. The dynamics of Barbie Land are both complicated and simple: Barbie, insulated in its confines, represents—in real-world terms—the beneficiaries of patriarchy. Ken represents, essentially, everybody else. Barbie, in her dismissals of Ken, doesn&#39;t mean to be mean; she treats him thoughtlessly because she has simply never considered that words—or anything, really—might cause hurt. She has never needed to. Comfort, in her society as in ours, is a luxury. The slogans of the human world—and the bleak dynamics that have transformed kindness and empathy from kindergarten lessons into political pleas—make no sense to those who cannot imagine other people&#39;s pain.<br><br> They make a lot of sense to Ken, though. He is, at the outset of the film, the most messily human feature of this plastic world, a tangle of need and hope and, eventually, rage. In the land of hard-set smiles, he winces. Surrounded by endless cheer, he aches. He senses that something is very much amiss. But sensing is all he can do. Barbie Land may have a president and a constitution and a supreme court, but it is, in practice, aggressively apolitical. (Politics is a response to humans and conflicts; Barbie Land allows neither.) And so, having no language or outlet for his frustrations—beleaguered, you might say, by a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/the-feminine-mystique-anniversary-betty-friedan/8751751?ean=9780393934656&amp;ref=&amp;source=IndieBound&amp;title=The+Feminine+Mystique%3A+A+Norton+Critical+Edition+%28Norton+Critical+Editions%29">problem that has no name</a> —Ken simply feels his way through his plight. His want leaves him afflicted with something else that is foreign in Barbie Land: vulnerability.<br><br> Much of <em>Barbie</em> ’s magic comes down to Robbie and Gosling and their ability, as actors, to blend the plastic and the human, the earnest and the camp. Robbie&#39;s performance, for its part, is a matter of distillation. It captures many of the elements that have made the Barbie doll both <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/05/tiny-shoulders-review-hulu/559277/">an enduring icon and an endless controversy</a> —among them her unattainable beauty, her blithe naivete, her whiteness, her thinness, her reminder that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/jeffrey-epstein-and-the-myth-of-the-underage-woman/596140/">even children are stalked by the shifting demands of womanhood</a> . Gosling finds similar nuance, but from the opposite direction: Ken is, infamously, a plus-one who is defined by his absence. Gosling fills in the blanks. And he does so by weaving one of the dolls&#39; elemental ironies—Barbie and Ken are teenagers who are routinely mistaken for adults—into his performance.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/08/jeffrey-epstein-and-the-myth-of-the-underage-woman/596140/">Read: The myth of the &#39;underage woman&#39;</a><br><br> Ken, in Gosling&#39;s rendering, lives in a stew of emotions that are always just beyond his control. He is by turns petulant and teeming with possibility, impulsive and self-conscious. Which is also to say that this chisel-jawed doll is, in many ways, a very typical adolescent. Barbie, newly beset by human-borne feeling, shocks herself by crying—first a single tear, and then a flood of them. Gosling&#39;s Ken cries too.但他的不和谐具有典型的男性特征。他勃然大怒。尽管他对此一无所知，但他觉得自己有权进行性行为。他非常关心其他人对他的看法。 “你不能让我在肯面前显得不酷！”他对着芭比哭泣，眼中闪烁着惊慌。<br><br>在电影的早期场景中，肯对芭比发脾气。他就在那里，散发着看着我的渴望。他就像罗密欧的诗歌或<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1GoH3M9Kb4g">劳埃德·多布勒的音箱</a>一样，将爱情变成了一场表演。他如此彻底地将自己的生活定位在芭比身上，以至于不久之后，他就成为了肯在芭比乐园中不能成为的一件事：一种障碍。<br><br>肯和芭比一样，对自己的需要感到不满。但《芭比乐园》并没有给他提供其他选择。<em>她就是一切；他只是肯</em>。这就是这个世界的方式。高斯林的表演体现了这一切。然后，它有力地使事情升级：肯对芭比的需求变得如此强烈，以至于凝结成暴力。很快，他充满希望的微笑就变成了冷笑。他对芭比娃娃的顽固渴望——以及他无法接受她的不感兴趣——开始唤起非独者的残酷权利。他的困境成为其他人的威胁。<br><br>这令人不安，洋娃娃变得危险。这就是它如此有效的原因。影片的大部分内容都让芭比和肯踏上了一段模仿青春期的旅程：离开了受保护、玩耍和轻松梦想的土地，他们陷入了人类世界的现实——以及成年期的艰难交易。玩偶必须在一个不乏语言来描述其政治状况的地方航行：<em>父权制</em>、<em>边缘化</em>、<em>物化</em>、<em>压迫</em>。<br><br>肯喜欢它。走在洛杉矶的街道上——他穿着流苏覆盖的西式服装，这是由于情节中的一次偶然事件而启发的服装选择——他开始昂首阔步。他第一次感到被尊重、被钦佩、被看见。与此同时，芭比娃娃是一个先感受到——然后又害怕——自己性别的脆弱性的人。<em>芭比</em>最好的笑话之一是肯回到芭比乐园后，用吉他为她弹了一首歌——他明确表示，这不是<em>给</em>芭比唱歌，而是<em>对着</em>她唱歌。肯低声哼唱，被他浪漫的手势所吸引，紧紧抓住芭比的目光，不肯放开。这一切的荒谬性被他选择的那首歌的歌词所戳穿——这首歌在现实世界中成为热门歌曲：<em>我想把你推来推去，好吧我会，好吧我会/我想把你推倒，好吧我会，好吧，我会</em>……<br><br>青春期是一个极端的时期。肯在男人的世界里经历了男子气概，他对新的处境做出了少年般的欢乐。当他像一个孩子一样沉浸在周围的环境中时——总是充满活力地沉浸在周围的图像和信息中——他首先直觉地认为，男子气概是现实世界中的一切，其次，男子气概必须与马有关。 （他总结道，父权制是“骑在马上的男人管理一切”的制度。）他对洛基·巴尔博亚和比尔·克林顿的形象着迷，对那些在健身房里互相击掌的家伙着迷。回到芭比乐园，他吸取了从现实中学到的教训，接管了芭比的梦想屋。他的 Mojo Dojo Casa House 是一个单身汉公寓和一家酒吧，从整体美学来看，是对约翰·韦恩 (John Wayne) 对美国男性气质的影响的致敬。显然，它的装饰以大量的马为特色。<br><br>肯的​​过激行为很有趣，也很愚蠢，而且，除了偷窃房屋的事情之外，还很容易引起共鸣。像任何青少年一样，肯正在弄清楚自己是谁，并尝试着世界的各种可能性。但他的不成熟并没有得到遏制，这就是它的问题。相反，他青少年时期对待世界的方式也影响到了其他人。很快——对于任何一个近年来关注美国政治的人来说，这个情节的转折同时也是一个转折——肯正试图改写芭比乐园的宪法。<br><br>肯试图将自己融入芭比乐园的政治生活，这是一种不祥的正义。这是零和世界问题的零和解决方案。多年来，肯娃娃一直被称为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/22/style/ken-barbie-doll-biography-cec/index.html">生殖器被严重缩短的水滴</a>”、“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.esquire.com/uk/culture/a44285254/the-history-of-ken-barbie/">一个令人不舒服的反男子气概的象征</a>”，以及——高斯林在<em>芭比娃娃</em>的宣传之旅中——“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/07/22/entertainment/ryan-gosling-ken-barbie-doll-cec/index.html">一个配件，甚至不是一个装饰品”。最酷的之一</a>。”当肯出现在 2010 年的<em>《玩具总动员 3》</em>中时，他发现自己收到了下面这句话：“你这个穿着阿斯科特的粉红鼻子！你不是一个玩具……你是一个有腿的钱包！”<br><br>这种侮辱变得更加侮辱性，因为它是由一个四肢可拆卸且有愤怒管理问题的块茎<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A-H9-CLfOWg">发出的</a>。但土豆头先生只是说出了大家都知道的事情：肯的定义事实是肯是由芭比娃娃定义的。仅凭这一点就很难不为这个家伙感到难过。对于许多<em>芭比娃娃</em>的观众来说，他的困境可能非常熟悉。正如我的同事雪莉·李（Shirley Li） <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">所写的</a>那样，影片中的一个关键时刻来自其中一位人类主角格洛丽亚（亚美莉卡·费雷拉饰），她在演讲中讲述了作为一个人所面临的挑战和完全的非理性，她在演讲中召唤了一生的挫败感。女人生活在一个由男人塑造的世界里。不过，另一个关键时刻来自肯。电影快结束了，他终于得到了他真正想要的一件事：芭比正在听他说话。他告诉她，为了别人的光芒而变得黯淡是什么感觉。然后他又补充了一句：“感觉不太好，不是吗？”<br><br>阅读：理解<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/"><em>芭比</em></a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">电影的</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-america-ferrera/674781/">令人惊讶的关键</a><br><br>那些指责<em>芭比娃娃</em>厌男的评论家可能想再看一次，如果他们真的看过的话。肯的​​台词有效地为格洛丽亚的演讲添加了标点符号。它做了我们当前的政治口号恳求我们做的事情，但徒劳无功：它产生同理心。肯发现，他其实并不想要政治权力；他只是想获得政治权力。这是很多工作。 （此外，令人失望的是，马只是“人的延伸器”。）他真正寻求的是按照自己的方式弄清楚自己是谁的能力。肯真的想要芭比娃娃吗？正如电影所暗示的那样，他愿意与另一个肯配对吗？如果他的身份比芭比和海滩更广泛，他会选择做什么？<br><br>在影片的结尾，肯不再只是一个了解人类世界生活的洋娃娃；他也是一个懂得在别人的故事中被当作临时演员的感觉的人。在他身上，塑造并限制我们政治可能性的辩论变得优雅而直接。肯是一个被剥夺了充分人格尊严的人。无论你的世界观如何，无论你的具体情况如何，无论你对<em>父权制</em>这个词有什么感受，这都是一种公然的不公正形式。<br><br>但在故事的结尾，肯也是一个逃离了发展停滞的人。他已经体现了<em>芭比娃娃</em>的核心思想之一：父权制是一种深刻的不成熟形式。它会导致孩子气。也是由此产生的结果。不过，我们有一个充满希望的理由，因为我们真正的男孩子们一直在努力将世界改造成他们的魔力道场之家：对于肯来说，不成熟变成了大多数人的样子——通往更好的道路上的一个阶段。肯没有变成人类。然而，他确实长大了。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 28 Jul 2023 13:10:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-ken/674852/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/barbie-movie-ken/674852/</item></channel></rss>
