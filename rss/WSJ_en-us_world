By March 2022, they were 60.3% higher than a year earlier.</p><p> That is because a large share of households—around 40%—pays electricity tariffs that are directly linked to daily moves in volatile wholesale prices.

Wholesale natural-gas prices have fallen by 90% from their peak in late summer of 2022. As a result, household energy prices are now much lower than they were in June 2022. Similar base effects are likely to push inflation rates lower in the rest of Europe over the coming months, economists say.</p><p> Disregarding those big swings in energy prices, Spain&#39;s inflation rate looks pretty much like it does elsewhere in Europe. The core measure—which excludes energy and food—stood at 5.9% in June, compared with 5.4% in the eurozone as a whole, driven by services such as recreation and restaurants. And if energy prices steady and stop lowering the all-items inflation rate, the continued rise in services prices may push the core measure higher again.</p><p> Spain&#39;s labor unions and employers agreed in May on a schedule of pay rises over the coming years that reduces the threat of what European central bankers call “tit-for-tat” inflation, where businesses raise prices to maintain or increase profits, workers respond by demanding higher wages, and businesses raise their prices again.</p><p> The deal includes a 4% raise this year and 3% in each of 2024 and 2025.</p><p> “The more we all work in the same direction, the sooner the victory will come,” said Núria Mas, an economics professor at the IESE Business School. “This agreement will play an important role in keeping inflation low.”</p><p class="articleTagLine"> — <em>Marcus Walker contributed to this article.</em></p><p> Write to Paul Hannon at <a href="mailto:paul.hannon@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">paul.hannon@wsj.com</a> and Humza Jilani at <a href="mailto:humza.jilani@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">humza.jilani@wsj.com</a></p></section></div></main></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 18 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-long-does-inflation-anger-linger-spanish-voters-may-have-the-answer-c8100cda</guid><link/> https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-long-does-inflation-anger-linger-spanish-voters-may-have-the-answer-c8100cda<author><![CDATA[Paul HannonHumza Jilani]]></author><category>经济表现/指标</category><category>Inflation Figures/Price Indices</category><category>经济新闻</category><category>政治/一般新闻</category><category>政治/国际关系</category><category>国内政治</category><category>选举</category><category>国家/总统选举</category><category>SYND</category><category>华尔街日报-PRO-WSJ.com</category><category>经济表现</category><category>指标</category><category>inflation figures</category><category> price indices</category><category>经济新闻</category><category>政治的</category><category>一般新闻</category><category>政治</category><category>国际关系</category><category>国内政治</category><category>选举</category><category>国家的</category><category>总统选举</category></item><item><title><![CDATA[China Sets Heat Record as John Kerry Arrives to Discuss Climate]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Temperatures in northwest exceed 120 degrees Fahrenheit in heat wave expected to last weeks <!-- data-module-name="article.app/lib/module/wsj/breadcrumbs" --><main id="main" role="main"><div class="wsj-article-headline-wrap crawler"></div><div class="articleLead" itemprop="articleLead" data-sbid="WP-WSJ-0001059875"><div class="is-lead-inset"><div class="media-object scope-

"></div><p> A veteran economist and banker had been getting ready to retire in the weeks before Chinese leader Xi Jinping picked him to lead China&#39;s central bank, according to officials familiar with the matter.</p><p> Now, Pan Gongsheng is set to take the reins at the People&#39;s Bank of China as it confronts an urgent challenge: whether and how to defend the Chinese yuan.</p><p> The Chinese currency&#39;s value <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/yuan-under-pressure-as-u-s-china-rates-set-to-diverge-further-aa655bcd?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been sliding</a> this year, as <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-economy-barely-grows-as-recovery-fades-5652a92a?mod=hp_lead_pos1&amp;mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noopener">the world&#39;s second-largest economy stagnates</a> . Economists and some Beijing officials worry the decline could turn into a rout, destabilizing China&#39;s financial system.</p><p> But propping up the currency brings its own risks, including slower growth for China and, potentially, the rest of the world, economists say.</p><p> Xi elevated Pan, the 60-year-old, Western-trained deputy PBOC governor of the past decade, because of his reputation as an experienced technocrat who could <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-plans-to-appoint-a-new-central-bank-governor-56a878ea?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">work well with foreign officials</a> , The Wall Street Journal has reported.</p><p> For now, Xi and his new leadership team have given little indication of Beijing&#39;s preferences, giving the new PBOC chief some room to help shape the yuan policy.</p><p> In Pan, Xi picked a man with a history of handling high-stakes tasks with global implications. But Pan has zigzagged over the years as a policy maker, depending on the top leadership&#39;s priorities.</p><p> During the early years of Xi&#39;s rule, which started in 2012, Pan promoted financial liberalization as part of the leader&#39;s agenda to give market forces bigger sway over the economy. That sometimes led to a freer—but weaker—yuan.</p><p> Other times, when there were sharp declines in the yuan&#39;s value, Pan advocated harsh capital controls to suit the leadership&#39;s demand to keep the currency stable, even as that contributed to weaker growth.</p><p> “Pan will be tested right out of the gate in establishing his credentials as a reformer committed to a more market-determined exchange rate,” said Eswar Prasad, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and former China head for the International Monetary Fund.</p><h3> Yuan Under Pressure </h3><div class="media-object scope-

At one point in late June, one dollar was valued at around 7.2 yuan, a level close to the weakest point since the 2008 global financial crisis.</p><p> In recent days, the PBOC has signaled—mainly through the official rate it sets to guide the yuan&#39;s daily trading—that its tolerance for fast depreciation <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-weakening-currency-is-becoming-a-headache-for-its-central-bank-372ec31d?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be wearing thin</a> . The yuan has rebounded to 7.17 against the dollar.</p><p> Downward pressure on the yuan is expected to persist, however. One big reason is that the PBOC is expected to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-cuts-borrowing-rates-again-in-bid-to-juice-recovery-466b1d90?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep cutting interest rates</a> to support growth, while its counterparts in the West will likely raise rates further to fight inflation.

China has built a sizable war chest to defend the yuan if it chooses to, including about $3 trillion in foreign-exchange reserves.</p><p> Xi, the third-term Chinese leader whose power rivals that of Mao Zedong, has made it clear that he has the final say on all major decisions including those involving the economy.</p><p> But he still seeks policy recommendations, especially for wonky issues such as currency management. He is expected to do so with Pan, who is set to be named PBOC governor in addition to his new role as the top Communist Party official at the bank.</p><div class="media-object scope-web

Join the conversation below.</em></p></div></div><p> US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen met with Pan <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/janet-yellen-says-u-s-china-making-progress-on-managing-economic-tensions-1e2c07?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">during her trip to Beijing</a> early this month and discussed China&#39;s currency management with him, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Treasury officials have been seeking more information about how Beijing manages its currency, and the department has long criticized China for not being more transparent about its currency practices.</p><p> Part of the challenge now for Beijing is that China&#39;s economy is in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-fading-recovery-reveals-deeper-economic-struggles-31f4097b?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">worse shape than years past</a> , constraining the central bank&#39;s room to maneuver.</p><p> If it takes a more hands-off approach and lets the market guide the yuan lower, that would likely help China&#39;s economy by boosting exports. But it would also risk a spiral of currency depreciation and capital outflows that could threaten China&#39;s stability, rippling through global markets.</p><p> More aggressive intervention to defend the yuan, however, would make China&#39;s exports less competitive. It would also make it harder for the PBOC to keep cutting interest rates, hurting China&#39;s—and the world&#39;s—growth.</p><p> Some analysts expect Pan to take a more interventionist approach to slow the yuan&#39;s depreciation in the short run. That could win him some political capital with the leadership, which seems to be obsessed with economic stability.</p><p> Then, those analysts say, Pan could use the political capital to push for a more market-driven yuan as he and his predecessors had advocated before.</p><h3> China&#39;s &#39;Hotel California&#39; </h3><div class="media-object scope-

Pan joined the central bank in 2012 as a deputy governor and pushed for making China&#39;s yuan and the overall financial sector more market-oriented.</p><p> In 2016, soon after he was named China&#39;s top foreign-exchange regulator, part of the central bank, Pan convinced top leaders to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-issuing-strict-controls-on-overseas-investment-1480071529?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">slap strict restrictions</a> on Chinese companies&#39; investing overseas in a bid to fight capital flight. Chinese outflows were weakening the yuan, forcing the central bank to spend $1 trillion, or a quarter of its currency reserves at the time, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-crusade-to-prop-up-yuan-neglects-other-pressing-needs-1492107144?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">to arrest the yuan&#39;s fall</a> .</p><p> That was followed by more regulatory barriers to keep money from leaving China, essentially dialing back years of efforts—including some championed by Pan—to make it easier for the Chinese to invest overseas and more attractive for foreigners to invest in China.</p><p> Some foreign investors since then have dubbed China “Hotel California,” where investors can check out but never leave. Still, Pan was praised by foreign investors for seeking them out to explain the central-bank&#39;s policy.</p><p> Shortly after the capital-control moves in late 2016, he attended a forum organized by the European Chamber of Commerce in China and told the audience that the central bank&#39;s paramount goal at the time was to “safeguard the stability” of China&#39;s foreign-exchange market.</p><p> In 2018, as China&#39;s currency came under pressure again, he famously warned traders from betting against the yuan.</p><p> An alternate member of the party&#39;s 205-member Central Committee since 2017, Pan wasn&#39;t named a full member at the most recent party Congress, suggesting he had been passed over for promotion.</p><p> But Xi turned to Pan for the PBOC job on broad support within the nation&#39;s economic hierarchy for his technocratic know-how, from people such as Liu He, a longtime economic adviser to Xi, and central-bank veterans including former PBOC Gov.

As part of MBS&#39;s plans to end Saudi Arabia&#39;s economic reliance on oil, he is pushing companies to move their regional headquarters to Riyadh, the Saudi capital, from UAE&#39;s Dubai, a more cosmopolitan city favored by Westerners. He&#39;s also launching plans to set up tech centers, draw more tourists and develop logistical hubs that would rival the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dubai-uae-saudi-arabia-oil-ukraine-qatar-aa72c59?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">UAE&#39;s position as the Middle East&#39;s center of commerce</a> .

The two countries work together with other Gulf neighbors on political, security and economic coordination, the official said.</p><p> The UAE official said their “strategic partnership is based on the same objectives and vision for regional prosperity, security, and stability.”</p><p> In December, after intensifying divisions over Yemen policy and OPEC limits, MBS called the meeting with the journalists. The Saudi leader said he had sent the UAE a list of demands, the people there said. If the smaller Gulf nation didn&#39;t fall in line, MBS warned, Saudi Arabia was prepared to take punitive steps, much like it did against Qatar in 2017, when Riyadh severed diplomatic relations for more than three years and engineered an economic boycott, with help from Abu Dhabi.</p><p> “It will be worse than what I did with Qatar,” he told the journalists, according to people there. </p><div class="media-object scope-

The country had been expelled in 2011 after President Bashar al-Assad&#39;s brutal crackdown on Syrian civilians demonstrating for change.</p><p> MBS is in talks with the US about formally recognizing Israel, which the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/israels-normalization-with-u-a-e-squeezes-saudi-arabia-11597397402?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">UAE did in 2020</a> . MBS is leading diplomatic efforts to quash violence in Sudan, where the UAE backs an opposing side.</p><p> In an effort to smooth over tensions, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have traded communiqués outlining their complaints and demands for change, according to officials from both nations.</p><p> In a pointed response to Saudi complaints, MBZ privately warned the Saudi ruler late last year that his actions were undermining ties between their two nations. He accused the Saudi crown prince of getting too close to Russia with its oil policies and pursuing risky moves, such as the diplomatic deal with Iran, without conferring with the UAE, Gulf officials said.</p><p> MBZ skipped an Arab summit MBS called for Chinese leader Xi Jinping&#39;s visit to Riyadh, and didn&#39;t show for the Arab League&#39;s vote in May to allow Syria back into the group. MBS himself was absent when MBZ met with Arab leaders at a hastily arranged regional summit in the UAE in January.</p><p> “Tensions are rising between them, in part because MBS wants to step out from under MBZ&#39;s shadow,” said Dina Esfandiary, a senior adviser at the International Crisis Group&#39;s Middle East and North Africa Program. “Things are going to get worse, because both countries are getting more confident and assertive in their foreign policy.”</p><h3> Forged alliance</h3><p> The Saudis and Emiratis have called themselves the closest of allies, but they have had a sometimes tense relationship since even before the UAE gained independence from Britain in 1971.</p><p> The UAE&#39;s founding father, Sheikh Zayed al Nahyan, bristled at Saudi domination of the Arabian peninsula, and then-Saudi King Faisal refused to recognize his Persian Gulf neighbor for years, seeking leverage in various territorial disputes. In 2009, the UAE scuttled plans for a common Gulf central bank over its proposed location in Riyadh. To this day, there are territorial disputes over oil-rich land between the two countries.</p><p> The two countries became closer with the rise of MBZ and MBS. The Emirati royal became de facto ruler of his country at the age of 54 in 2014 when his half-brother, President Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed, had a debilitating stroke. When MBS began accruing power after his father King Salman&#39;s accession in 2015, MBZ began grooming the young Saudi prince, then just 29 years old. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Accompanied by trained falcons and a small entourage, the outing—roughly equivalent in Gulf tradition to a round of presidential golf—was a turning point in their friendship, according to people familiar with the excursion.</p><p> MBZ and other senior Emirati officials played a key role in lobbying the Trump administration in favor of MBS, who was then still deputy crown prince. MBZ helped orchestrate then-President <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> &#39;s trip to Saudi Arabia in 2017, which bolstered MBS. The Saudi prince launched a palace coup the next month to become heir apparent and then began eliminating critics and potential rivals.</p><p> In formulating a plan to transform and open up his conservative kingdom, MBS looked to MBZ for guidance and tapped some of the same banks and consultants that the Emiratis used for a similar plan a decade earlier.</p><p> MBS and MBZ forged a foreign-policy alliance that intervened in Yemen, bolstered Abdel Fattah Al Sisi&#39;s grip on power in Egypt, armed Libyan fighters in that divided country&#39;s east and boycotted Qatar over ties to Iran and Islamists. Both men have since tried to extricate their countries from those interventions. Today, MBS feels that the Emirati president led him into disastrous conflicts that served the interests of the UAE and not Saudi Arabia, Gulf officials said.</p><p> MBS “does not like him and he wants to show him up,” said Douglas London, a retired Central Intelligence Agency officer who now works as a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute, a Washington-based think tank. He said that as threats from Iran and terrorist groups recede, tensions between them are likely to escalate. Still, London said the Saudi leader had developed a more practical approach to leading his country that makes it unlikely that he would take rash actions against the UAE</p><h3> OPEC dispute</h3><p> The rift bubbled to the surface in October last year when OPEC, the 13-nation oil-production group that <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/saudi-arabia-u-a-e-scoop-up-russian-oil-products-at-steep-discounts-d327a2ee?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">has allied with Russia</a> , decided to slash output in a move that blindsided the Biden administration. The UAE went along with the cut, but in private <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/before-opec-production-cut-saudis-heard-objections-from-a-top-ally-the-u-a-e-11667335415?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">told US officials and the media that Saudi Arabia had forced it to join the decision</a> .</p><p> The dynamic reflected a longer-running feud between the Saudis and Emiratis over policy in OPEC, a body that Riyadh has long dominated as the world&#39;s top crude exporter. The Emiratis have raised their oil-production capacity to more than four million barrels a day and have plans to go above five million, but are allowed under OPEC policy to pump no more than about three million, costing it hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenues.</p><p> The Emirati increase in oil-production capacity also gives it the potential ability to move output up and down, and with it global oil prices. Until recently, only Saudi Arabia wielded that sort of market power.</p><p> Emirati frustrations reached the point where they told US officials they were ready to pull out of OPEC, according to Gulf and US officials. US officials said they took it as a sign of Emirati anger, not a real threat. At OPEC&#39;s last meeting, in June, the Emiratis were allowed a modest increase in their production baseline, and their energy minister emerged holding hands with his Saudi counterpart. </p><div class="media-object scope-

This could undermine efforts to keep the country united. Saudi- and Emirati-backed fighters working together to defeat Houthi forces have at times turned their weapons on each other over the years.</p><p> In December, the UAE signed a security deal with the Saudi-backed Yemeni presidential leadership council that gives Abu Dhabi the right to intervene in Yemen and the waters off its coast. Saudi officials viewed it as a challenge to their Yemen strategy.</p><p> Saudi Arabia has plans to build a pipeline from the kingdom to the Arabian Sea via the Yemeni province of Hadramout, with a seaport in its regional capital, Mukalla. Emirati-backed forces in Hadramout threaten those plans.</p><p> Analysts at the Middle East and North Africa program at Chatham House, an independent think tank in London, have warned that the rival Yemeni forces are preparing for new clashes that threaten ongoing peace talks. “The two Gulf monarchies are increasingly aggressive towards each other in the region. Yemen is just the first front line,” Chatham House research fellow Farea Al-Muslimi wrote on Twitter.</p><p> If the Saudis withdrew from Yemen now, the Houthi-controlled north would align with Iran and the south would align with the UAE, leaving Riyadh with little to show for the war, said Yemeni officials, reflecting Saudi concerns.</p><h3> Biden goal</h3><p> The Saudi-Emirati rivalry has vexed the Biden administration, which wants friendly Gulf capitals like Riyadh and Abu Dhabi to help form a united front against Iran. Ending the war in Yemen, which triggered a humanitarian disaster, is also a key foreign policy goal of the administration, which wants stability in the region and in oil markets.</p><p> Neither MBS nor MBZ is perfectly <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-saudi-relations-biden-mbs-animosity-11666623661?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">aligned with Washington</a> on important matters such as Ukraine and China.

Instead, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-middle-east-trip-is-a-high-risk-bid-to-reset-saudi-relations-11657481150?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Biden visited Saudi Arabia</a> in July 2022, helping end his isolation. Now, US companies that had been hesitant to engage with the kingdom are taking a second look. That interest will likely accelerate as a year-end deadline approaches for companies with contracts from the Saudi government to establish a base in Riyadh instead of flying in from Dubai.</p><p> The Biden administration brokered a May 7 meeting between MBS and the Emirati president&#39;s younger brother, Sheikh Tahnoun bin Zayed, once seen as a confidant of the Saudi crown prince, said people familiar with the matter. Tahnoun had been frozen out, making at least six trips to the kingdom without securing a meeting with MBS until he got help from the US, the people said.</p><p> MBS told Tahnoun that the UAE shouldn&#39;t disrupt cease-fire talks in Yemen that the Saudis are leading and promised concessions to the UAE, the people said. But later he told his advisers that they shouldn&#39;t change any policies toward the UAE “I don&#39;t trust them anymore,” he told advisers, the people said.</p><p> Write to Summer Said at <a href="mailto:summer.said@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">summer.said@wsj.com</a> , Dion Nissenbaum at <a href="mailto:dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">dion.nissenbaum@wsj.com</a> and Stephen Kalin at <a href="mailto:stephen.kalin@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">stephen.kalin@wsj.com</a></p></section></div></main></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 18 Jul 2023 04:01:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.wsj.com/articles/frenemies-saudi-crown-prince-mbs-clashes-uae-president-mbz-c500f9b1</guid><link/> https://www.wsj.com/articles/frenemies-saudi-crown-prince-mbs-clashes-uae-president-mbz-c500f9b1<author><![CDATA[Summer SaidDion NissenbaumStephen Kalin]]></author><category> leder</category><category> wsjworld</category><category>政治/一般新闻</category><category>国际关系</category><category>政治/国际关系</category><category>Royal Families</category><category> SYND</category><category>华尔街日报-PRO-WSJ.com</category><category>政治的</category><category>一般新闻</category><category>国际关系</category><category>政治</category><category>royal families </category></item><item><title><![CDATA[Ukraine Adopts Slow Approach to Counteroffensive]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Swift loss of several tanks and infantry fighting vehicles has jolted Ukraine and its Western backers <figure><img src="https://images.wsj.net/im-818058/?width=1278&amp;size=1" alt="Yuriy Ulshyn, also known as ‘Greek,’ leads his comrades in an area controlled by the Ukrainian army near Bakhmut." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Yuriy Ulshyn, also known as &#39;Greek,&#39; leads his comrades in an area controlled by the Ukrainian army near Bakhmut. <span></span></figcaption></figure><!-- data-module-name="article.app/lib/module/wsj/breadcrumbs" --><main id="main" role="main"><div class="wsj-article-headline-wrap crawler"></div><div class="articleLead" itemprop="articleLead" data-sbid="WP-WSJ-0001059643"></div><div class="articleBody" data-sbid="WP-WSJ-0001059643"><div class="clearfix bylineWrap"><div class="byline"> By <span class="author" itemprop="name"><a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/james-marson" itemprop="url" rel="author">James Marson</a></span> | Photographs by Emanuele Satolli for The Wall Street Journal</div><time class="timestamp article__timestamp flexbox__flex--1"> Updated July 18, 2023 12:00 am ET </time></div><div subscriptions-actions="" subscriptions-display="NOT data.noSharing"><div class="share-bar"><amp-social-share type="system" width="72" height="24" data-param-url="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ukraine-adopts-slow-approach-to-counteroffensive-our-problem-everywhere-is-the-sky-a2e51d7a"></amp-social-share></div></div><section subscriptions-section="content"><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

On the third day of the counteroffensive, he drove to Mala Tokmachka to the southeast of Orikhiv to check out the route they were supposed to take. As artillery shells crashed around him, he began to withdraw when he saw a Ukrainian vehicle blown up and body parts of Ukrainian soldiers strewn over the road. He and his teammates dismounted to recover what they could.</p><p> Now, the task is even more daunting.

The Storm Shadows can strike farther but are expensive and in shorter supply, while the US has so far declined to provide longer-range ATACMS missiles that can be launched from Himars.</p><p> So Ukraine has resorted to using Himars in a more daring fashion in recent weeks, moving them as close as a few miles from the front line to strike deeper into occupied territory and push Russia&#39;s ammunition dumps and command posts farther back.</p><p> Cluster munitions provided by the US could help blast holes in minefields and Russian defensive networks including trenches and antitank obstacles called dragon&#39;s teeth.</p><p> Russia remains vulnerable because its troops are generally less well prepared and supplied by a weak logistics chain that depends heavily on railways.

Russian Ka-52 helicopters hover at a distance of around 5 miles, outside the range of Stinger missiles, and fire laser-guided missiles at Ukrainian targets.</p><p> The West blundered by giving tanks and armored vehicles but insufficient means, such as jet fighters or air-defense systems, to protect them from attack, said Yuriy Ulshyn, a 49-year-old commander near Bakhmut, better known as “Grek,” or “Greek.”</p><p> “It&#39;s like giving a bike without pedals,” said Grek. “Thanks a lot for the bike, but…”</p><p> Grek, a former geologist, commands a unit of some 40 volunteers whom he stations in gaps between larger formations, gluing them together at potential weak points.</p><p> His men on a hillside 3 miles from the edge of Bakhmut are armed with a Stinger and a Soviet-era PKM machine gun, looking out for Russian jets, helicopters and aerial drones. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

You need so much of everything. When he can&#39;t see it, he&#39;s in the dark, and you don&#39;t need as much.”</p><p> The lack of equipment weighs on Grek. A tow rope snapped as he was trying to drag a damaged car away from the front line. Immobilized vehicles, even those in Russian range, are quickly stripped for useful parts.

"></div><p> Robert F. Kennedy Jr. says childhood vaccines are linked to autism and that the Central Intelligence Agency killed his uncle. He has wondered out loud whether Wi-Fi exposure leads to cancer. Some of tech&#39;s big stars are praising <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robert-f-kennedy-election-presidential-campaign-2024-5265d2b8?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">his campaign for president</a> .</p><p> Silicon Valley loves a contrarian, which is why some tech luminaries <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investor-peter-thiel-donald-trump-gets-big-things-right-1477934224?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">threw their support</a> to Republican <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/donald-trump">Donald Trump</a> in 2016 and 2020. This time around, Kennedy, a Democrat, is the one getting the antiestablishment buzz in the tech world.</p><p> Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey has recently voiced support for Kennedy, who is running against President Biden for the Democratic Party&#39;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/robert-kennedy-jr-files-to-run-for-president-as-a-democrat-1149fd33?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">presidential nomination</a> . Kennedy has been feted by a handful of other tech titans, including <strong>&nbsp;</strong> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/when-spac-man-chamath-palihapitiya-speaks-reddit-and-wall-street-listen-11615006818?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">SPAC king</a> Chamath Palihapitiya and David Sacks, a founding executive of <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/PYPL" class="company-name">PayPal</a> and trusted ear to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/elon-musk">Elon Musk</a> .现已关闭的文件共享网站 LimeWire 的创始人马克·戈顿 (Mark Gorton) 成立了一个支持肯尼迪的 PAC。</p><p> They say they like his willingness to go against the status quo.</p><p> “Mr.肯尼迪的竞选活动是关于未来，而不是过去，”前国会议员、肯尼迪竞选经理丹尼斯·库西尼奇说。 “People in the tech community want a president who is forward-looking, who wants to expand America&#39;s role in technology, has respect for data privacy and is profoundly creative in his approach toward government.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

Silicon Valley power brokers such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/NFLX" class="company-name">Netflix</a> co-founder Reed Hastings are backing Biden, who is expected to be <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/joe-biden-2024-presidential-re-election-campaign-87ef002b?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">the nominee</a> .</p><p> Still, the attention around Kennedy coupled with his family&#39;s popular name are complicating Democrats&#39; primary process.</p><p> “As Americans are exposed to more about his extreme and unpopular record, his support will continue to falter,” said an adviser to Biden.</p><p> Last week, Kennedy said that Covid-19 targets Black and white people while sparing people of Ashkenazi Jewish or Chinese descent, according to remarks first published by The New York Post.</p><p> His remarks drew public outcry. Kennedy said in a statement that he was being smeared as an anti-Semite.</p><p> The tech industry is often painted as a group that favors progressive candidates, but that isn&#39;t always the case.</p><p> The government&#39;s response to the pandemic, including lockdowns, was an inflection point that caused some tech voters to become more conservative on social issues, said Neil Malhotra, a professor of political economy at Stanford University&#39;s business school.肯尼迪对 Covid-19 疫苗的安全性表示怀疑，并反对封锁。</p><p> The fact that parts of corporate America <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wall-street-mobilizes-for-a-presidential-election-reluctantly-49b4b735?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">are unenthused</a> about the front-runners for both parties—former President Trump is <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-republican-presidential-rivals-criticism-39d476c5?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">the front-runner</a> for the GOP nomination—has also given him an opening. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Sacks, for example, is a donor to Florida Gov. <a href="https://www.wsj.com/topics/person/ron-desantis">Ron DeSantis</a> &#39;s run for the Republican nomination. He, along with Musk, took part in DeSantis&#39;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ron-desantis-trump-successor-president-3e9df9d6?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">campaign launch</a> in a live event on Twitter. Palihapitiya, meanwhile, has voiced support in the past for former United Nations ambassador and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/nikki-haley-enters-gop-presidential-race-as-first-major-trump-challenger-4f88d0da?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">a GOP hopeful</a> .</p><p> “It&#39;s important to celebrate people who raise serious, demanding questions,” Palihapitiya said in an email. “Clearly, the more people hear from RFK, the more they agree with our view that he should be part of the debate going forward.”</p><p> Sacks and Dorsey didn&#39;t respond to requests for comment.</p><p> Dorsey has backed unconventional presidential candidates in the past. 2019 年，他向科技企业家安德鲁·杨 (Andrew Yang) 和前夏威夷国会女议员图尔西·加巴德 (Tulsi Gabbard) 的竞选活动捐款。 They both ran for the Democratic presidential nomination.</p><p> Gorton, the LimeWire founder, created a super PAC called American Values 2024 that, he said, started as an organization focused on combating “pharmaceutical industry corruption.” It now supports Kennedy&#39;s candidacy.</p><p> “It disgusts me that the Democratic Party has become the party of the neocons and the party of big pharma,” Gorton said in an interview. “I think him running to reclaim the Democratic Party from the corrupt interests is noble.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

Ted Kennedy —Robert F.

Tickets were $2,000 for the cocktail reception and $10,000 for the dinner.</p><p> The event, held at Sacks&#39;s mansion in San Francisco, was attended by 75 guests, mostly from tech and crypto industries, said Sofia Karstens, an actress and treasurer of Common Sense.</p><p> At 69, Kennedy is about a decade younger than the 80-year-old Biden.
