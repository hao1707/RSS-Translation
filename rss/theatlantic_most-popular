Graham），他负责保存我们的 2024 年大选“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/tracking-democrat-republican-presidential-candidates-2024-election/673118/">备忘单</a>”，想了解他现在如何看待非特朗普的共和党竞争者。 “蒂姆·斯科特、尼基·哈利和维韦克·拉马斯瓦米都处于这个有趣的境地，你可以想象他们脱颖而出，要么与德桑蒂斯匹敌，要么取代德桑蒂斯成为主要的非特朗普竞争者，但现在很难想象他们中的任何人对特朗普发起严峻的挑战，”大卫告诉我。最后，他说：“看来这只是一场激烈的银牌争夺战。”<br><br><b>而第三方问题也逐渐浮出水面。</b><br><br>中间派团体 No Labels 的创始主席是康涅狄格州前参议员乔·利伯曼 (Joe Lieberman)，该组织正准备支持 2024 年第三方总统竞选——“这让民主党越来越警惕，”我的同事拉塞尔·伯曼 (Russell Berman) 本周早些时候<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/joe-lieberman-interview-no-labels-2024-election/674711/">写道</a>。 （到目前为止，该组织拒绝讨论其提名人可能是谁。）<br><br>没有任何标签领导人表示他们希望保护选民免受特朗普和拜登之间的重赛之害。 “但民主党人和不少共和党人担心，这样的计划可能会导致利伯曼坚持认为他不愿意看到的事情发生：特朗普重返白宫，”拉塞尔指出。 No Labels 表示将在 2024 年春季决定是否提名候选人。拉塞尔解释说，该组织可能会等待两种不太可能发生的情况：拜登会改变竞选连任的想法，或者“特朗普的法律困境最终将说服共和党选民转向其他地方。”<br><br>与此同时，一位前景渺茫的候选人正在白宫引发巨大的恐惧。我的同事马克·莱博维奇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/biden-cornel-west-no-labels-2024-election/674757/">今天写道，</a>学者、民权活动家和绿党候选人科内尔·韦斯特可能不会获胜，但韦斯特仍然让民主党人感到担忧。马克解释道：“韦斯特存在着一种特殊的民主焦虑，只有<i>绿党总统候选人</i>这样的词才能引发这种焦虑。”您可能还记得，吉尔·斯坦在 2016 年在关键战场州横扫选票，超过了希拉里·克林顿在这些州输掉的选票。<br><br>民主党人对第三方候选人的恐惧并非没有根据：正如马克指出的那样， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/third-party-candidate-spoiler-trump-biden/">最近的民调</a>显示，在特朗普和拜登之间的正面竞争中，特朗普更有可能从第三方候选人的加入中受益。<br><br>下个月，我们可能会在<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://projects.propublica.org/climate-migration/">ProPublica 的</a>一项分析认为，拉莫伊尔是整个美国最能免受气候变化综合影响（包括海平面上升、野火、农作物受损和经济影响）影响的县。但那是在洪水之前。<br><br>本月早些时候，县中心附近的莫里斯维尔<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/11/us/vermont-ny-rainfall-totals-floods.html">降雨量为 5 至 10 英寸</a>。附近沃尔科特的道路被毁。拉莫伊尔河的洪水在剑桥周围盘旋，三十人被疏散。农作物全部被毁，主要道路无法通行。佛蒙特州公共安全专员詹妮弗·莫里森称拉莫伊尔县是该州“受灾最严重的地区”。<br><br>七月的洪水只是佛蒙特州今年一系列极端天气事件中最新的一起。在经历了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.noaa.gov/news/january-2023-was-nations-6th-warmest-on-record#:~:text=The%20average%20January%20temperature%20across,their%20warmest%20Januaries%20on%20record.">历史上温暖的</a>一月之后，五月下旬的霜冻可能摧毁了该州一半以上的商业苹果作物。到了夏天，加拿大野火产生的烟雾窒息了曾经洁净的空气。随后，7 月 10 日这一周，暴雨淹没了州首府蒙彼利埃，冲毁了全州的房屋和企业。这是自飓风艾琳以来最严重的洪水，艾琳飓风是 12 年前袭击的“100 年”风暴。<br><br>佛蒙特州不再是许多人认为的避风港。如果这个充满田园风光的小州不安全，又远离海洋，而且是该国最凉爽的地区之一，那么很难想象还有哪个地方是安全的。<br><br>学术界长期以来一直对确定“气候避难所”感兴趣，即随着全球气温持续攀升，这些地区不太可能遭受极端高温、海平面上升和内陆洪水的影响，并且可能有能力容纳气候难民。佛蒙特州的城镇经常出现在这些名单上。其中一份由杜兰大学房地产教授杰西·基南去年编制， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/21/climate-change-encourages-homeowners-to-reconsider-legacy-cities.html">包括</a>佛蒙特州伯灵顿以及宾夕法尼亚州匹兹堡和北卡罗来纳州阿什维尔等城市。然而，根据气候非营利组织第一街基金会最近的一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.unionprogress.com/2023/07/16/pittsburgh-region-faces-increasing-rain-flood-risks-as-planet-warms/">分析</a>，匹兹堡可能会每二十年遭遇一次 100 年一遇的风暴；未来几十年，阿什维尔预计将容易出现干旱、极端高温和极端降水。如果所谓的避难所的情况看起来如此糟糕，那么我们就急需觉醒了。<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://vtdigger.org/2022/05/16/nicholas-adams-vermont-faces-a-looming-climate-refugee-crisis/">调查</a>发现，佛蒙特州三分之一的新居民因气候相关原因搬到这里。我的朋友乔·迪克森就是其中之一。他和他的丈夫曾经在德克萨斯州巴斯特罗普县拥有一个农场，该地区每年都会发生更多的野火和山洪。 2017 年，飓风哈维冲毁了一座桥梁，使他们的社区陷入困境。仅一年前，他们搬到了佛蒙特州的秘鲁。乔告诉我，上周洪水过后，他感到一种“深深而焦虑的警惕”——尽管他的房子位于高地，但他还是彻夜不眠地查看天气预报。就像在德克萨斯州的暴风雨期间，他每隔一两个小时就会醒来，出去检查雨量计，看看小溪，等待水溢出的那一刻。<br><br>长期居住在佛蒙特州的人也同样对洪水感到震惊。周六，我在我们当地的有机农场遇到了我的朋友布拉德·皮科克（Brad Peacock），他已经在沙夫茨伯里生活了几十年。 “我不认为我是唯一一个认为佛蒙特州为应对气候变化做好了更好准备的农民，”他告诉我。我们习惯了生活在一个崇尚自然、气候政策先进的北方州。我们预计不会像飓风艾琳期间以及上周那样措手不及。<br><br> <a

在朋友的婚礼上在雨中跳舞，我抱着她还在襁褓中的妹妹。我们不知道很快整个城镇就会因高速公路被冲毁而与世界隔绝。但上周的风暴有所不同。我的两个女儿现在分别是 14 岁和 12 岁，她们的手机收到了洪水警报；他们的朋友发送了水冲过他们房子的视频。最初的降雨过后，我们沿着 7A 号公路向北行驶，调查受损情况。我们的轮胎溅过高速公路上几英寸深的积水。地下室的物品被倾倒到前院进行紧急保管。当地的公园和果岭完全被淹没，巴滕基尔河——通常是清澈的——被径流变成棕色，河水如此之高，在下面咆哮时舔着当地的一座桥梁。<br><br>回到家后，我们的集体情绪都很低落。 “我能感觉到自己在期待一些不好的事情发生，”弗雷泽告诉我。后来，当我们在客厅沙发上观看洪水的新闻片段时，Zephyr 感到忧郁。 “我感到害怕，因为我必须在一个被毁的佛蒙特州长大，”她说。<br><br>与其他美国农村人一样，佛蒙特州人往往与周围的土地有着深厚的联系。我的农民朋友布拉德为田地被洪水淹没的当地人感到悲痛。他在给我的信中写道，有些人“可能永远无法回到他们如此精心照料的土地，这确实伤害了我的心”。 “我知道与土地相连是什么感觉，一想到它眨眼间就被夺走，我就心碎。”<br><br>在全国各地，在气候避风港和已知的风险地区，家庭都害怕失去与家乡的联系。佐治亚州的农民正在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/georgias-peach-crop-lost-warm-weather/">为失去的桃子作物</a>而悲痛。佛罗里达州的房主们正注视着 90 度的大海，等待着海水掠过他们家门前草坪的那一天。路易斯安那州的人们正在看着海水冲过一座家庭小屋的高跷，越来越接近将其卷走。<br><br> <a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/6/29/23762219/ai-artificial-intelligence-new-nuclear-weapons-future">写道</a>：“我认识很多从事人工智能政策工作的人，他们一直在阅读罗德的书来获取灵感。” 《<em>纽约时报》</em>对人工智能公司 Anthropic 的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/technology/anthropic-ai-claude-chatbot.html">介绍</a>指出，罗德斯的书“在公司员工中很受欢迎”，其中一些人“将自己与现代的罗伯特·奥本海默进行比较”。<br><br>就像之前的奥本海默一样， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/31/technology/sam-altman-open-ai-chatgpt.html">许多人工智能商人</a>相信他们的创造可能会改变历史进程，因此他们与深刻的道德问题作斗争。即使他们在开发技术的同时，也担心如果<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/30/technology/ai-threat-warning.html">人工智能变得比人类更聪明</a>并变得失控，会发生什么，随着生成人工智能模型吸收<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/artificial-intelligence-ai-chatgpt-dall-e-2-learning/672754/">大量信息</a>并显得越来越有能力，这种推测的可能性已经演变成一种不可动摇的神经症。 40 多年前，罗德斯开始对人类历史上最重要的成就之一进行权威的阐述。今天，它就像一本使用说明书一样被仔细审查。<br><br>罗兹本人并不是一个末日论者，但他了解 20 世纪 40 年代洛斯阿拉莫斯的工作与当今硅谷所发生的事情之间的相似之处。 “奥本海默多次谈到原子弹既是危险又是希望，”罗德告诉我——它可以结束战争，同时威胁到终结人类。他曾 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dwarkeshpatel.com/p/richard-rhodes#details">表示</a>，人工智能可能像核能一样具有变革性，并饶有兴趣地关注着硅谷最大的公司为构建和部署人工智能而展开的疯狂竞争。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/ai-regulation-sam-altman-bill-gates/674278/">阅读：人工智能厄运论是一个诱饵</a><br><br>毫无疑问，人工智能的支持者和建设者会对罗兹在其书 25 周年纪念版的前言中提出的一个论点感到安慰，即核裂变的发现以及原子弹的发现是不可避免的。 “要阻止它，你就必须停止物理学，”他写道。这一论点与乐观的人工智能公司<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/06/29/us-china-chip-export-restrictions-ai-race">和政府</a>的言论相呼应，他们将这项技术视为全球信息军备竞赛的一部分。按照逻辑，民主国家不能停下来或等待法律出台，以免我们输给中国或其他一些敌对势力。<br><br>这个想法有助于解释为什么技术专家会构建一个人工智能系统，即使他们相信它可以消灭人类的生命—— <em>《原子弹的制造》</em>第一部分中的铭文也是如此。罗德在这里引用了奥本海默的话：“科学中深奥的东西不是因为有用而被发现的，这是一个深刻而必然的真理；而是因为它们有用。”他们被发现是因为有可能找到他们。”<br><br>作为一名技术作家，我职业生涯的大部分时间都在与那些拥有建设冲动的人打交道，无论后果如何。我对人工智能创始人和研究人员的心态感到着迷和困惑，他们说他们对自己正在积极努力创造的事物感到恐惧。我一直在努力使这种性格特征与我自己的倾向相一致：谨慎，对意想不到的后果矩阵的痴迷。我问罗德，这是什么？是什么让人们能够打开潘多拉魔盒？这个问题悬在空中，就在兴登堡号悬空模型的下方，我想象着罗兹在脑海中翻阅着一系列采访和卷角的传记。<br><br>他开始解释。他说，任何伟大的科学家，“在他们 12 岁之前”，都会“有一些形成性的经历，这些经历推动他们走向他们要前进的方向，并让他们决定要经历学习数学或科学的艰苦过程，直到他们能够突破界限。”恩里科·费米（Enrico Fermi）是第一个核反应堆的发明者和原子弹的总设计师，他在青少年时期失去了一位心爱的兄弟，不久之后，他开始痴迷于测量和量化他生活的各个领域。 “他可以告诉你他在街上走了多少步，”罗兹说。 “他看起来非常像一个在数字中找到了他失去兄弟时所失去的那种确定性的人。”罗兹说，十岁时，利奥·西拉德 (Leo Szilard) 因一部关于太阳即将消亡的匈牙利史诗而深感不安，以至于他开始迷恋火箭，以此作为拯救地球的一种方式，这一追求最终使他发现了核链式反应。<br><br> “这么多最终参与炸弹计划的人都是逃离纳粹德国的犹太人，这并非巧合，”他说。 “他们看到了那里发生的事情，他们就在周围，他们知道这很可怕，必须阻止。”罗兹也在自己的作品中看到了童年的阴影，其特点是继母手中的身体虐待和饥饿：“毫不奇怪，我所有的书在某种程度上都是关于人类暴力以及如何处理它的，因为我是这方面的专家。”<br><br>也许这是二元性的另一个教训——在事物的宏伟计划中，我们的噩梦和梦想是一体的。如果说罗德希望人工智能研究人员和创始人从<em>《原子弹的制造》</em>中借鉴一个概念，那就是<em>互补性</em>的概念。这是诺贝尔奖获得者、丹麦物理学家尼尔斯·玻尔的量子物理学思想。据罗兹介绍，玻尔在曼哈顿计划最黑暗的日子里前往洛斯阿拉莫斯向奥本海默传授。用非常基本的术语来说，互补性描述了对象如何具有无法同时观察到的相互冲突的属性。世界包含众多。<br><br>根据罗兹的说法，玻尔从这一观察中发展出了完整的哲学世界观。归根结底，一个可怕的武器可能同时也是一个很棒的工具。 “玻尔的想法给洛斯阿拉莫斯带来了希望，”罗德斯说。 “他告诉关心这种大规模杀伤性武器的物理学家，这个东西将改变战争的现状，从而改变国际政治的整个结构。它要么完全结束战争，要么毁灭世界。前者给了他们希望。”<br><br>在罗兹看来，最重要的教训是，你可能会制造出一种世界末日武器，但事实证明它是不稳定和平的有缺陷的代理人。但反之亦然：旨在让人类永续繁荣的工具可能会带来灾难。因此，对于罗兹来说，对人工智能的真正恐惧只是我们走在一条不确定的道路上，我们进展太快，创建的系统可能违背其预期目的：生产力工具最终会破坏就业机会；合成媒体最终模糊了人造与机器制造、事实与幻觉之间的界限。 “最令人不安的是，社会吸收和适应它的时间太少了，”罗兹在谈到人工智能的崛起时说道。<br><br>在我们离开他的办公室的路上，罗兹停下来给我看了一个胶片盒大小的罐子，里面装着一些看起来像石头的东西。一张褪色的打字标签上写着<span class="smallcaps">Trinitite</span> ，这是 1945 年 7 月 Trinity 核弹试验后从新墨西哥州沙漠地面上刮下的残留物的名称。爆炸温度如此之高，以至于沙子变成了玻璃。 “很诡异，不是吗？”罗德笑着说道。我现在很清楚他为什么把这些文物保存得这么近了。它们是玻尔哲学的物理表现，也是罗德斯大部分作品的主线——与室内设计的互补性。这提醒我们，自然世界和我们为自己建造的世界的欢乐和恐怖在于，很少有东西会按照我们的预期行事。无论我们如何努力，我们都无法同时观察到这一切。它提醒人们，存在于无法解开的谜团中所固有的兴奋和恐惧。<br><br></div>

href="https://geosci.uchicago.edu/~archer/warming_papers/sawyer.1972.warm2000.pdf">20 世纪 70 年代</a>做出一些最早的气候变化预测以来，它们在预测全球气温上升速度方面就非常准确。英国埃克塞特大学气候科学家戴维·阿姆斯特朗·麦凯表示，几十年来，气候变化大致以预期的速度进行。然而，其影响正在加速——有时远远快于预期。<br><br>有一段时间，后果并不容易看到。他们今天确实是这样。西南地区在热穹下酷热难耐。佛蒙特州遭遇倾盆大雨，这是大约十年来的第二场百年风暴。七月初是有记录以来全球最热的一天——第二天再次超越了这一里程碑。 “很长一段时间，我们都处于正常范围内。但现在我们真的不是了。”哥伦比亚大学物理研究科学家阿莱格拉·勒格兰德 (Allegra LeGrande) 告诉我。 “而且它发生得足够快，人们都记得它发生过。”<br><br>事实上，越来越多的气候科学家现在相信，我们可能正在走向所谓的临界点，即沿着同一轨迹的渐进步骤可能会推动地球系统发生突然或不可逆转的变化，从而导致即使突然停止排放也无法阻止的转变。阿姆斯特朗·麦凯和他的合著者去年秋天在<em>《科学》杂志</em>上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abn7950#tab-contributors">总结道</a>：“全球变暖超过 1°C 后，地球可能已经处于‘安全’气候状态。”如果超过这些阈值，全球变暖的一些影响（例如永久冻土融化或世界珊瑚礁消失）可能会比预期更快地发生。然而，总体而言，突破这些临界点的影响仍然是气候变化最重要的未知数：我们真的不知道事情<em>何时</em>或<em>以多快的速度</em>崩溃。<br><br>一些自然系统如果被颠覆，可能预示着世界的重组。以南极洲西部的思韦茨冰川（Thwaites Glacier）为例：它的面积大约有佛罗里达州那么大，有一个突出的冰架阻碍了冰川流入海洋。尽管冰架的整体融化速度比最初预测的要慢，但温暖的水现在正在从下面侵蚀它，造成<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05691-0">深深的裂缝</a>。在某一时刻，融化可能会进展到足以自我维持，这将保证冰川最终崩溃。结果如何将有助于确定海平面<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1904822116">将上升</a>多少，从而决定数百万人的未来。<br><br>思韦茨冰川的命运可能独立于其他临界点，例如影响南美山区冰川消失或西非季风的临界点。但一些临界点会相互作用， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scientistswarning.forestry.oregonstate.edu/climate_feedbacks">相互影响恶化</a>。例如，当<a data-event-element="inline link"

AMOC就像一条传送带，从北部热带地区汲取温水。水的盐度随着蒸发而增加，这与其他因素一起导致水下沉并沿着海底向南返回。随着更多的冰川淡水进入系统，传送带将会减弱。目前它是 1000 多年来最弱的一次。<br><br> <a

He published a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/Documents/PipelinePaper.2023.05.19.pdf">working paper</a> this spring suggesting that a reduction in sulfate aerosol particles—or the air pollution associated with burning coal and the global shipping industry—has contributed to warmer temperatures. That&#39;s because these particles cause water droplets to multiply, which brightens clouds and reflects solar heat away from the planet&#39;s surface. Though the paper has not been peer-reviewed, Hansen predicts that environmentally minded policies to reduce these pollutants will likely cause temperatures to rise by 2 degrees Celsius by 2050.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/heat-climate-crises-natural-disasters/674700/">Read: &#39;Things don&#39;t always change in a nice, gradual way&#39;</a><br><br> Even before the climate gets to that point, we may face a dramatic uptick in climate-related disasters, says William Ripple, a distinguished professor of ecology at Oregon State University and the lead author of a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scientistswarning.forestry.oregonstate.edu/sites/default/files/feedbacks.pdf">commentary</a> on the “risky feedback loops” connecting climate-driven systems. There&#39;s a sense of awe—in the original meaning of inspiring terror or dread—at witnessing such sweeping changes play out across the landscape. “Many scientists knew these things would happen, but we&#39;re taken aback by the severity of the major changes we&#39;re seeing,” Ripple said. Armstrong McKay likened the challenge of being a climate scientist in 2023 to that faced by medical professionals: “You put a certain emotional distance between you and the work in order to do the work effectively,” he said, “that can be difficult to maintain.”<br><br> Although it may be too late to avert some changes, others could still be staved off by limiting emissions. LeGrande said she worries that talking about tipping points may encourage people to think that any further action now is futile. In fact, the opposite is true, Ripple said. “Scientifically, everything we do to avoid even a tenth of a degree of temperature increase makes a huge difference.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 17:35:54 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/climate-change-tipping-points/674778/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/climate-change-tipping-points/674778/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Gesture That Encapsulates Remote-Work Life]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The &#39;Zoom wave&#39; is awkward, corny, and vital. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/JmJG5rUglwP8vROtBQhrKP9WYJo=/0x0:6720x3780/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/GettyImages_1248900571_copy/original.jpg" alt="A black-and-white image of a group video-call with people waving in each square" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Getty</figcaption></figure> <span class="smallcaps">If you&#39;ve spent any time</span> over the past few years on group video calls, perhaps, by now, the “Zoom wave” feels natural to you—or as natural as it possibly could. How else would you bid farewell to your virtual comrades after a budget meeting, or a graduate seminar, or a family catch-up? Clicking “Leave meeting” and vanishing seems a little harsh. No—you wave. The elbow is bent sharply to fit it in view of the webcam. The motion is exaggerated, as earnest as a golden retriever. You make eye contact with everyone, which is to say no one. Especially now that remote work is common for white-collar workers, people—myself included—are doing the same corny little gesture in front of countless computer screens across the country, all looking like nerds.<br><br> I needed to know why we American office workers have decided to collectively embarrass ourselves in this specific way, so I asked some experts. Body-language researchers told me that although some people probably Zoom-waved before the pandemic, the gesture really took off in the COVID-lockdown era. In December 2019, Zoom had about 10 million meeting participants daily; by April 2020, that number exceeded <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232401/zoom-300-million-users-growth-coronavirus-pandemic-security-privacy-concerns-response">300 million</a> . Many people weren&#39;t used to this many group video calls, to frozen screens and unmuting and side-chatting, to feeling disembodied and dislocated and isolated. So perhaps in an effort to make it all feel a little more normal, they started doing the wave at the end of meetings. It quickly became “part of the ritual of signing off,” Spencer Kelly, a Colgate University psychologist, neuroscientist, and gesture researcher, told me.<br><br> Today, we&#39;re still in a pandemic, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/remote-work-return-to-office-policies/674736/">plenty of people</a> are still video calling. This month, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wfhresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/WFHResearch_updates_July2023.pdf">one survey</a> found that about 40 percent of American workers were either fully remote or worked on hybrid schedules; in April, more than 800 million different people across the globe used Zoom. And yet, the Zoom wave&#39;s staying power was not inevitable. Instead, it has stuck around maybe not in spite of its awkwardness, but because of it.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">For all their ubiquity</span> , group video calls pose an immense challenge to human communication. In person, we don&#39;t rely solely on words. Humans convey and receive information from highly subtle body language—which is usually lost in a tiny Zoom square. Joe Navarro, a nonverbal-behavior expert and the author of <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/what-every-body-is-saying-an-ex-fbi-agent-s-guide-to-speed-reading-people-joe-navarro/9780061438295?affiliate_id=atl-347">What Every Body Is Saying</a></em> , told me that even the slight arch of an eyebrow can indicate that you like someone; just the faint lift of a finger paired with brief eye contact might stand in for a goodbye. This ambient, largely subconscious exchange of physical signals makes people feel acknowledged and affirmed, however fleetingly. “We reward each other with these little behaviors,” he said.<br><br> Movements can also make people seem more trustworthy. Navarro told me that when people hold their face too still, others don&#39;t tend to like it; even babies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/ed-tronick-and-the-8220-still-face-experiment-8221/">react negatively</a> , for instance, to their caregiver&#39;s motionless face. Gestures and expressions convey valuable information, and when those signals are absent, we might fear danger or rejection. Words can deceive us, after all, and body language can reveal a lot about someone&#39;s true feelings or intentions. And gestures can also signal goodwill, just because someone is putting in effort at all. “The fact that you&#39;re defying gravity and burning blood sugar means you really care,” Navarro said, “and it makes a big difference in how you&#39;re perceived.”<br><br> On Zoom, small motions are harder to pick up on, so people have adapted by making them larger, more stylized, and, perhaps, a bit gauche. I find myself nodding vigorously through entire Zoom meetings, trying to show my attention to the speaker, to the point that my neck literally gets sore. Others have told me they&#39;ve added gestures to their repertoire that they never would use in person: a big, goofy grin to signal mild amusement, or a thumbs-up or a heart shape with their hands to demonstrate appreciation. Some also use the Zoom feature that lets you show an emoji on your screen—say, the clapping hands, or the “party popper” spewing confetti. Emojis and outsize physical gestures really achieve the same end: They are crystal-clear symbols conveying straightforward sentiments, perfect for a setting in which nuance is so easily lost. When you do the Zoom wave, you&#39;re essentially becoming a sentient emoji yourself.<br><br> Highly legible actions with a specific meaning, such as a wave or a thumbs-up, are called “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/06/talk-to-the-hands/309315/">emblem gestures</a> ”; you&#39;re conscious of doing them, unlike “co-speech gestures,” which encompass all the little ways people talk with their hands, usually subconsciously. Many new emblem gestures, Kelly told me, spread by imitation, but it&#39;s unclear why some last longer than others. In a sense, emblem gestures are like words: Once a new one is coined, its meaning can change over time, and eventually it might fade out of use. Some randomness is involved.<br><br> But the researchers I talked with had some theories about what might give a gesture staying power. Susan Wagner Cook, a University of Iowa psychologist, told me that one is more likely to stick if it&#39;s particularly useful. The Zoom wave certainly is; beyond just expressing cordial warmth, it gives us a way to bookend an interaction—to indicate that a meeting is truly done, and to acknowledge other people&#39;s presence before we leave. And Diana R. Sanchez, who leads the Workplace Technology Research Lab at San Francisco State University, pointed out that the Zoom wave is appropriate for people of different levels of closeness. It might be particularly helpful for workplaces, then: It&#39;s sweet but bland, not too intimate or too cheeky.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/05/good-riddance-handshake/611404/">Read: Good riddance to the handshake</a><br><br> A floppy hand wag has also long been used for joining people across a distance. The Zoom wave is obviously an adaptation of the regular wave, which is a common way to call attention to yourself so someone can spot you from far away. You probably wouldn&#39;t wave at someone right next to you, but you&#39;d wave at someone across a room. In a sense, then, it&#39;s fitting for Zoom. Though users can see one another&#39;s faces, they might feel emotionally far from one another—and of course, they usually are physically far too.<br><br> When people wave, they trigger reciprocation. Wagner Cook told me that others tend to have a natural response to wave back—perhaps partly because “mirror neurons” can fire when people observe or perform <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/2/2/114/2736771">communicative hand gestures</a> . And research suggests that when people move in synchrony, they feel more connected. Typically, people are meant to Zoom wave all at once—though in reality it&#39;s rarely perfectly coordinated. The platform is a cornucopia of lagging connections and inadvertent interruptions; it&#39;s practically defined by being out of sync. But Kelly told me that when someone mimics your motions, it goes from satisfying to creepy if the imitation is too obvious or exact. So the messy Zoom wave might actually hit a psychological sweet spot.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/05/awkward-silence-in-conversation-zoom-video-chat/673937/">Read: Embrace the awkward silence</a><br><br> The gesture&#39;s perfect imperfection might explain its ubiquity in a larger sense too. Yes, it has to be unsubtle in order to translate on-screen, but that&#39;s exactly why the Zoom wave is so fitting for this moment. Like a video call itself, it can be weird and uncomfortable, and yet people choose to do it together. In a time when many are feeling socially fragmented, there&#39;s something sweet, even necessary, about that total and shameless sincerity. However isolated we may be, and however much we depend on technologies that keep shifting beneath our feet, we keep trying to find ways back to our humanity and embodiment. So I have to admit: I&#39;m grateful for the stupid gesture, and I&#39;ll carry on doing it. It&#39;s a sign of how profoundly the world has changed—but also how humans, in essential ways, have not.<br><br> <em><small>When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

The effect is hard to categorize; <em>Minx</em> isn&#39;t “raunchy” or “smutty” or “filthy” or even “risqué.” Unlike <em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/06/euphoria-hbo-review-zendaya/591955/">Euphoria</a></em> or <em>The Idol</em> , it&#39;s not interested in hollow provocation. And the penises that proliferate on-screen aren&#39;t there to titillate, exactly, although a montage in the first episode brings to mind what the French film theorist Jean-Louis Comolli once described as “the frenzy of the visible.” If anything, the show&#39;s insistent focus on male nudity feels impertinent, as though we&#39;re all participating in a ritual desanctification of dicks. The show&#39;s clever inversion of subject and object makes erotica seem faintly absurd: Here are men&#39;s bodies exposed for us to look at. Take away the novelty aspect, and what&#39;s left? What does the act of looking actually make us feel?<br><br> <em>Minx</em> is about Joyce (played by Ophelia Lovibond), a buttoned-up Vassar grad toiling away at a teen magazine while dreaming of securing funding for her austere second-wave-feminist publication, <em>The Matriarchy Awakens</em> . Her side project is the antithesis of sexy. (“Why is she so <em>angry</em> ?” a bewildered executive asks, looking at Joyce&#39;s cover subject, a frizzled activist, mouth agape, raising a fist.) But at a pitch conference, Joyce meets Doug (Jake Johnson, pulling off genial scuzzbucket as only he can), the publisher of a stable of pornographic magazines with titles such as <em>Milky Moms</em> and <em>Feet Feet Feet</em> . Doug is venal but smart; he senses a sea change in the sexual landscape—and an opportunity. To get people to pay attention, he tells Joyce, “You gotta hide the medicine. It&#39;s like, when you give a pill to a dog, you dip it in peanut butter first.” The medicine, in case it isn&#39;t totally clear, is radical feminist ideas, housed within a magazine the pair name <em>Minx</em> . The peanut butter? Naked men.<br><br> The question the show asks isn&#39;t whether the two creators will successfully collaborate—their odd-couple, non-romantic chemistry is far too good not to. It&#39;s whether sex can be used to successfully sell anything other than sex itself. <em>Minx</em> is a sly analysis of the tension between creative vision and commercial compromise, which makes its graceless cancellation feel even more pointed, although the second season was rescued by Starz, and premieres this week. The joy of Season 1, for me, lay in the show&#39;s unabashed championing of pleasure, its irreverent sense of humor, its allusions to fault lines in feminist history. But most interesting was how <em>Minx</em> , like the fictional magazine it was examining, wasn&#39;t just sandwiching subversive ideas together with sexual imagery. It was creating a dialogue between the two. For her first photoshoot, Joyce places her centerfold model, an adorable dodo named Shane, in the middle of a construction site, wearing nothing but a toolbelt, while three snarling women in power suits heckle him from the street. “It&#39;s the ability to look,” Joyce concludes. “It makes a woman feel powerful.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/08/bad-sex-nona-willis-aronowitz-book-review/671123/">Read: How should feminists have sex now?</a><br><br> But is <em>feeling</em> powerful enough? <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crooked.com/podcast-series/stiffed/"><em>Stiffed</em></a> , a recent podcast from the writer Jennifer Romolini, charts the history of <em>Viva</em> , the visionary feminist erotic magazine that helped inspire <em>Minx</em> , and that published Simone de Beauvoir, Lorraine O&#39;Grady, and Erica Jong next to soft-focus images of naked men. At its best, Romolini argues, <em>Viva</em> managed to be a “bridge between feminism, activism, sexuality, and groundbreaking journalism.” And yet, as the fact that you may very well have never heard of <em>Viva</em> attests, the magazine failed. It failed because its publisher, the <em>Penthouse</em> founder Bob Guccione, presumed to know what women wanted to see without actually endeavoring to find out. It failed because sexual representation, for women, particularly straight women, has always been a bind—our desires are often informed by the same chauvinistic terrain we&#39;re trying to transcend. Both <em>Minx</em> and <em>Viva</em> make one thing clear: Men have set the parameters of porn since the beginning.<br><br> <em>M <span class="smallcaps">inx</span></em> <span class="smallcaps">is set roughly around</span> 1972, at the beginning of a moment that <em>The New York Times</em> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1973/01/21/archives/pornochic-hardcore-grows-fashionableand-very-profitable.html">crowned</a> “porno chic,” noting the prominence in popular culture of a feature-length porn film titled <em>Deep Throat</em> . Early in the show&#39;s new season, Joyce and Doug host the West Coast premiere of the movie, but keep hitting roadblocks: Feminist anti-porn campaigners are picketing outside, there&#39;s a streaker on the red carpet, and someone has replaced the projectionist&#39;s reel with the family film <em>Bedknobs and Broomsticks</em> . (Cue a joke about Angela Lansbury that I can&#39;t repeat.) Joyce, edgy and uncertain about the whole thing, runs into Joan Didion in the bathroom, who helps Joyce contextualize her feelings about a hard-core movie being so ceremoniously vaulted into the mainstream. “Doesn&#39;t it feel like people are longing for a way to be more open about sexuality without asking questions?” she asks Joan. She eventually pulls together an editor&#39;s letter for <em>Minx</em> titled “Why I Hated <em>Deep Throat</em> —And Why It&#39;s Good for America.”<br><br> The episode is indicative of my issues with Season 2: The show is glib where it used to be thoughtful, evasive about the exploitative edges of the business it&#39;s portraying, and seemingly more interested in staging a quippy &#39;70s costume party than engaging with the mission of the magazine at its center. Because as an object lesson in sexual representation on film, nothing is more loaded, or more fascinating, than <em>Deep Throat</em> . For the first time, hard-core pornography came packaged in the recognizable narrative structure of a movie, with dialogue and a plot and a heroine&#39;s journey. Not to mention that <em>Deep Throat</em> was funny, in a disarming, slapstick kind of way. It was sleazy, but not sinister. It made sex on-screen seem accessible to people who would never have been seen dead on 42nd Street.<br><br> More crucial, though, <em>Deep Throat</em> pulled off a confidence trick in plain sight: It disguised male fantasy as female empowerment. The movie&#39;s premise is that its central character (played by Linda Lovelace) has never had an orgasm and is left unsatisfied by conventional sexual encounters. When she consults a doctor, he informs her that her clitoris is actually located in the very back of her throat, meaning that only extremely committed fellatio will satisfy her. “Though it was touted as a celebration of female sexuality, <em>Deep Throat</em> can be seen as a study in the male control of female sexuality,” a <em>Wall Street Journal</em> retrospective <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-SEB-76264">concluded</a> in 2013. Lovelace later wrote in her memoir that she&#39;d been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2002/apr/28/features.review">violently coerced into performing in the movie</a> . Before any of this, though, the movie was enshrined as one of the defining cultural spectacles of the sexual revolution. Martin Scorsese saw <em>Deep Throat</em> . So did Spiro Agnew—reportedly at Frank Sinatra&#39;s house—and Jackie Kennedy. (In the show, Joyce name-checks the stars present at the premiere: “Warren Beatty, Alans Arkin and Alda.”)<br><br> If the “joke” of <em>Deep Throat</em> was that it told women they could be most gratified and most liberated while on their knees, the prevailing message of the era for men was that objectification could be damaging. That year, Burt Reynolds posed nude for <em>Cosmopolitan</em> , resplendently hirsute—with a strategically placed arm—on a bearskin rug. The caption accompanying the image stated frankly that women&#39;s “visual appetites,” while equal to men&#39;s, had long been neglected, and that <em>Cosmo</em> was trying to redress the balance. The magazine sold out ( <em>Minx</em> ’s first episode takes some pleasure in showing women reading it openly in the workplace). But Reynolds <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/human-interest/2018/09/burt-reynolds-cosmo-centerfold-game-changer.html">came to regret the shoot</a> , calling it “a total fiasco” in his autobiography and lamenting that it prevented people from taking him seriously as an actor. Still, the image was trailblazing: Prior to the 1960s, as the author Nancy Friday writes in <em>Women on Top</em> , women weren&#39;t even acknowledged to have sexual fantasies, let alone take pleasure in the sexualized image of a male body.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/09/romance-novels-women-elinor-glyn-books/670609/">Read: Don&#39;t call them trash</a><br><br> <em>Viva</em> ’s mission, as Romolini explains on <em>Stiffed</em> , was to capitalize on this moment of flux. There was space for a magazine, everyone involved believed, that would acknowledge women as sexual beings (with high-quality erotic photography) while gratifying their political impulses with articles about the work-life balance, sexual liberation, and the case for not having children. The major hurdle, at least at first, was Guccione, who was progressive about sex and about promoting women in the workplace, but limited by his own sexual imagination: <em>Viva</em> ’s first issue featured mostly images of naked women in the <em>Penthouse</em> mode, along with articles by exclusively male writers including Norman Mailer. “I don&#39;t think [Bob] gave a moment&#39;s thought to what women wanted or needed,” one former <em>Viva</em> staffer tells Romolini.<br><br> Later, when Guccione conceded to demands—including from the woman who would become his wife, Kathy Keeton, whom he hired as editor—and started publishing pictures of naked men, things somehow only got more confounding. Advertisers fled; writers balked at having their bylines next to hazy, Vaseline-clouded photos of male genitalia. Perhaps most complicated, though, was the question of how to conceive of erotic images that would appeal to women. “It wasn&#39;t terribly nuanced—they could&#39;ve done better with the male nudes, made them more attractive from a woman&#39;s point of view,” the former <em>Viva</em> staffer Annie Gottlieb explained in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.shondaland.com/inspire/books/a19601651/oral-history-viva-70s-porn-magazine-for-women/">an oral history</a> of <em>Viva</em> from 2018. “I thought they were funny, actually. They [seemed like] a man&#39;s attempt to imagine what a woman would like to look at. But, I mean, I&#39;ve seen a penis before. If I turned the page and there was one, I would shrug and turn [to] the next page.”<br><br> Fifty years later, we still haven&#39;t quite figured out how to honestly appraise female desire in mainstream culture—to cater to it in a way that isn&#39;t blurred by what men want to see. The commodification of sex-as-porn is part of the problem—think of the proliferation of the term <em>the money shot</em> , with its presumed primacy of the male orgasm. Although plenty of visionary women are making feminist porn, their work is typically paywalled, limiting their influence compared with the tsunami of violent, misogynist content that anyone, anywhere, can see for free in a given day. “Flesh comes to us out of history; so does the repression and taboo that governs our experience of flesh,” Angela Carter writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-sadeian-woman-angela-carter/9781844083770?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>The Sadeian Woman</em></a> . Sexuality, she concludes, “is never expressed in a vacuum.” In her TedX Talk, the feminist filmmaker Erika Lust recalls the moment that she realized what porn largely is—a discourse about sexuality where “the only ones participating in the discourse … are men.” It&#39;s not enough, as <em>Viva</em> learned, to simply invert subject and object and assume straight women will respond. There is power in looking, it&#39;s true. But there&#39;s more in getting to decide for ourselves what we want to be revealed, and what we want to reveal in turn.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/11/sex-love-and-goop-sex-education-netflix-sex-positivity/620588/">Read: Where sex positivity falls short</a><br><br> This is in no small part why <em>Minx</em> ’s abandonment of the ideas that made Season 1 so distinctive—the way it interrogated how to <em>sell</em> feminism while honoring the amorphousness of female desire—feels so disappointing. Watching <em>The Idol</em> recently (for my sins), I was struck by how old-fashioned it felt; how in thrall to <em>Deep Throat</em> ’s message that what women really crave, even if they don&#39;t know it, is degradation. Is this what Max canceled <em>Minx</em> for? In the final episode of <em>Stiffed</em> , the media consultant and sexual-equality advocate Cindy Gallop tells Romolini that “any industry that is male-dominated at the top inevitably produces output that is objectifying and offensive and objectionable to women.” More frustrating, though, is what Gallop concludes about the landscape of pornography and erotica, half a century after <em>Viva</em> , <em>Deep Throat</em> , and Burt Reynolds on that bearskin rug: that women have never been allowed to explore human sexuality through their own lens, free of external influences or commercial pressures or repression.

It&#39;s time for another round of Mounting Democratic Jitters, cherished summer pastime from Wilmington to the West Wing. Today&#39;s installment: Cornel West, unlikely MAGA accessory.<br><br> West, the famed academic and civil-rights activist, is a Green Party candidate for president. He probably will not win. Not a single state or, in all likelihood, a single electoral vote. But he remains a persistent object of concern around the president these days.<br><br> I&#39;ve talked with many of these White House worrywarts, along with their counterparts on Joe Biden&#39;s reelection team and the usual kettles of Democratic anxiety who start bubbling up whenever the next <em>existential-threat</em> election is upon us. Even with the nuisance primary challenger Robert F. Kennedy Jr. polling in the double digits, West inhabits a particular category of Democratic angst, the likes of which only the words <em>Green Party presidential candidate</em> can elicit.<br><br> You can understand the sensitivities, given the history. Democrats still recoil at the name Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee in 2016, whose vote total in key battlegrounds—Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania—wound up exceeding the margins by which Hillary Clinton lost in those states. What&#39;s Dr. Stein doing these days, anyway?<br><br> “She is my interim campaign manager,” Cornel West told me this week in a phone interview. Not a joke, as Biden would say. Or an acid flashback. Apparently Ralph Nader was not available. Not Dennis Kucinich, either (already snapped up to run RFK Jr.&#39;s campaign). It might be kind of funny if the stakes didn&#39;t involve a return Trump ordeal in the White House.<br><br> “The fact that Jill Stein is running his campaign is a little on the nose,” one senior Democratic campaign strategist told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/robert-f-kennedy-jr-presidential-campaign-misinformation-maga-support/674490/">Read: The first MAGA Democrat</a><br><br> West has repeatedly denied that he might play a spoiler role. “I would say that most of the people who vote for me would not have voted for Biden,” he told me. “They would have probably stayed home.” In a recent CNN appearance, West dismissed the two parties as a “corporate duopoly” and professed “great respect for my dear brother Ralph Nader and great respect for sister Jill Stein.” This did nothing to assuage Democratic jitters.<br><br> I asked West whether he would campaign all the way to Election Day 2024, or if he might reconsider his venture at some point. “My goal is to go all the way to November,” he said, but allowed that circumstances could change and so could his plans. “I&#39;m trying to be a jazzlike man,” he said. “Trying to be improvisational.”<br><br> In his campaign-launch <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/CornelWest/status/1665743761551548416">video</a> , West promised that his candidacy would focus on core progressive issues such as health care, housing, reproductive rights, and “de-escalating the destruction” done to the Earth and our democracy. “Neither political party wants to tell the truth,” West said, by way of explaining why he is running as a third-party candidate.<br><br> Notably, West has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/CornelWest/status/1678490771228622848">asserted</a> that NATO was as much to blame for Russia&#39;s war in Ukraine as the Kremlin. He has railed against the coalition as an “expanding instrument” of Western aggression, which he says is what provoked Russia&#39;s onslaught. “This proxy war between the American Empire and the Russian Federation could lead to World War III,” he wrote in a social-media post calling for diplomatic talks. West also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/CornelWest/status/1681684210040582146">dismissed</a> as a “sham” a House resolution—passed Tuesday—that affirmed US support for Israel. “The painful truth is that the Israeli state—like the USA—has been racist in practice since its inception,” West wrote on Twitter.<br><br> Several Democrats were eager to tell their own truths about West&#39;s endeavor, expressing uniform exasperation.<br><br> “This is not the time in order to experiment. This is not the time to play around on the margins,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/4091419-democratic-jitters-grow-over-cornel-wests-third-party-bid/">warned</a> Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison during a recent appearance on MSNBC. “What we see is a lot of folks who want to be relevant and try to be relevant in these elections and not looking at the big picture.”<br><br> “Too little attention is being paid to this,” David Axelrod, the former top Barack Obama strategist, told me. Axelrod recently gave voice to the gathering Democratic freak-out when he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/davidaxelrod/status/1677360196845469697">tweeted</a> out some basic historical parallels. “In 2016, the Green Party played an outsized role in tipping the election to Donald Trump,” he wrote. “Now, with Cornel West as their likely nominee, they could easily do it again.”<br><br> In our interview, Axelrod noted that the 2020 race between Biden and Trump, in which neither Stein nor West was on the ballot, underscores how slim the Democrats&#39; margin of error remains. “When you have three states that you won by 41,000 votes combined, you just cannot afford to bleed votes, even a few of them,” Axelrod told me.<br><br> Ben Wikler, the Democratic Party chair of one of these states—Wisconsin—said he expects Trump allies to help prop up any third-party effort as a way to undermine Biden. “Regardless of the motivations of third-party candidates themselves, they can have the effect of delivering net votes to Trump next year,” Wikler said, “especially if a Trump-aligned super PAC pours money into targeted messages,” he added. “And those are exactly the kind of cynical games you have to expect.”<br><br> Cedric Richmond, a former Democratic congressman and White House adviser who recently signed on as co-chair of the Biden campaign, called West a “substantive person.” But Richmond argued that Biden has earned the support of the left through his record on the environment, health care, gun reform, and other progressive causes. “They also know that [Biden] could have done a hell of a lot more if not for this hostile Supreme Court,” Richmond told me. “And they know they got this hostile Supreme Court because &#39;Hillary wasn&#39;t good enough,&#39; because &#39;we weren&#39;t happy and we wanted to support Jill Stein&#39; or whatever the reason was at the time.” Now that voters have experienced a Trump presidency, he said, the cost of casting a protest vote with a third-party candidate should be much more apparent. “I think people have seen this movie, and they know the ending,” Richmond said.<br><br> In recent days, the putative-centrist outfit No Labels—which many Democrats have been quick to <em>label</em> as a pro-Trump collaborator—has been the main source of third-party hand-wringing.  The group is trying to recruit a so-called unity ticket that would appear on ballots across the country, possibly led by Senator Joe Manchin, the West Virginia Democrat.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/joe-lieberman-interview-no-labels-2024-election/674711/">Read: Joe Lieberman weighs the Trump risk</a><br><br> “The idea that a third-party candidate won&#39;t hurt the Democratic nominee is preposterous on its face,” Matt Bennett, executive vice president of Third Way, a center-left policy think tank that lately has been focused on stopping No Labels, told me. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/third-party-candidate-spoiler-trump-biden/">Recent polls</a> show that in a head-to-head race between Trump and Biden, Trump is more likely to benefit when a third-party candidate is added to the mix. Likewise, an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/dems-republicans-are-open-third-party-presidential-candidate-rcna91368">NBC survey</a> from last month revealed that 44 percent of registered voters would be open to a third-party candidate—and there were considerably more Democrats saying this (45 percent) than Republicans (34 percent).<br><br> But Bennett explained that if No Labels does not recruit a serious candidate to actually run, the group will remain a largely hypothetical menace. West, meanwhile, is definitely running. The Green Party has an organizational structure in place in many states that will ensure the nominee&#39;s position on general-election ballots. West has deep roots on the left, and is better known than Stein was in 2016. Like Clinton, Biden has faced uncertainty about how much enthusiasm he can expect from his own party, especially young progressives.<br><br> “Dr. West has a huge following among college-age voters and a lot of folks who are more interested in social movements than they are in supporting Democratic or Republican candidates,” Basil Smikle, a Democratic strategist who was the executive director of the State Democratic Party of New York from 2015 to 2018, told me.<br><br> West was a vocal supporter of Senator Bernie Sanders&#39;s presidential campaign in the 2020 Democratic primary. He has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedp.com/article/2020/11/biden-democracy-penn-justice-democrats-socialists">said</a> that he wound up voting for Biden in the general election because “a fascist catastrophe is worse than a neoliberal disaster.” He also dubbed Biden “mediocre” and “milquetoast” (a tepid endorsement, let&#39;s say).<br><br> Supporters of Biden are hopeful that the blessing of progressive allies such as Sanders, who endorsed his reelection in April, will insulate the president from the threat of West-inspired defections to the Green Party. “What Bernie can do is say, &#39;Look man, we thought the existential threat of Trump had waned, but it&#39;s still here,&#39;” Smikle said. “We need you to show up again.”<br><br> Another prominent Bernie booster from 2020, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, endorsed Biden during a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://crooked.com/podcast/the-biden-bump-with-aoc/">appearance</a> on the podcast <em>Pod Save America</em> . The host Jon Favreau asked a follow-up about what she thought of West. Ocasio-Cortez appeared to tread carefully but sounded deferential. “I think Dr. West has an incredible history in this country,” she said. “What he gives voice to is incredibly important.” She went on to slam No Labels as a source of great concern, given “the sheer amount of money and bad-faith actors involved with it.”<br><br> “Not all third-party candidacies are created equal,” Ocasio-Cortez summarized. But she landed on a pragmatic point. “The United States has a winner-take-all system, whether we like that or not,” she said, adding that the cost of messing around could be fascism. “We have to live with that reality,” she said. Live with Joe Biden, in other words. Because the alternative is far worse—not a joke.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 12:40:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/biden-cornel-west-no-labels-2024-election/674757/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/biden-cornel-west-no-labels-2024-election/674757/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Why Can’t We Quit Weddings?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Marriages aren&#39;t what they used to be.

Women as breadwinners. Stay-at-home dads. Gay marriages. Polyamorous marriages! Yet despite all these evolutions, the ritual that ushers in those marriages—the American wedding—has hardly changed at all. Weddings <em>are</em> constantly evolving, but often in the direction of more elaborate, more luxe, more wedding-like.

Gonzalez tells us about the out-there demands of the uber rich. (Preview: monks; pizza; an orchid bear.) We talk about how those demands trickle down to the average couple, with delusions of a celebrity-style wedding, done on the cheap. And we puzzle over the big question: Why are we so fixated on this grand old tradition?<br><br> Listen to the conversation here: <br><br><iframe class="lazyload" data-src="https://player.megaphone.fm/ATL3903853621" frameborder="no" height="200" scrolling="no" title="embedded interactive content" width="100%" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></iframe> <em>Subscribe here: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/radio-atlantic/id1258635512">Apple Podcasts</a> |<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4PgNKjRJJWlaV6zuNr69BO">Spotify</a> | <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/radio-atlantic">Stitcher</a> | <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5tZWdhcGhvbmUuZm0vcmFkaW9hdGxhbnRpYw">Google Podcasts</a> | <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pca.st/ccxU">Pocket Casts</a></em><br><br> <strong><em>The following is a transcript of the episode:</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Hanna Rosin:</strong> I watched <em>The Wedding Planner</em> last night. Just, I was like: <em>Oh my God.</em><br><br> <strong>Xochitl Gonzalez:</strong> Can we talk about it? Because I know that movie like the back of my hand.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I mean, I love J. Lo, but I have not dipped into a rom-com from that era in a while. Every moment of it felt kind of manufactured and awkward.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Oh, so completely. That is like the era of the cultural stereotype.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yes.是的！<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Of shorthand, right? Like one trope after another. Although there&#39;s a great line when the boss of her little wedding-planning operation is like: “I&#39;ve done things no innocent planner should ever have to.”<br><br> [ <em>Laughter.</em> ]<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right. I did think of you when I heard that line.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Right. It&#39;s a good line. That&#39;s actually a good line.<br><br> <strong><em>[MUSIC]</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I&#39;m Hanna Rosin. This is <em>Radio Atlantic</em> . If you&#39;re getting married this summer, I pity you. Not because of the marriage. I&#39;m sure that&#39;ll be fine. But because of the wedding. Social media seems to have changed the game for the average couple. Every wedding is now supposed to look like a luxury wedding and yet somehow cost a lot less than an actual luxury wedding.<br><br> But the weirdest thing for me is that weddings still exist at all. Marriage is totally different than it used to be. Women&#39;s roles are totally different. And yet the wedding just keeps getting more … wedding-y.<br><br> Why do we keep innovating and improving on what is basically an artifact from the early 19th century?<br><br> So because surely some of you out there are attending a wedding or 15 this summer, we are going to talk about weddings with someone who has lived through many, many of them: <em>Atlantic</em> writer Xochitl Gonzalez. She just wrote a confessional for the magazine about her years running a luxury wedding business. And before that she wrote an exceptional novel called <em>Olga Dies Dreaming</em> about a wedding planner, that was way more intense about the class and race dynamics of the American luxury wedding than the Jennifer Lopez movie. Why do we have to mention that movie? Hi, Xochitl.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Hi. It&#39;s so nice to talk to you.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah, it&#39;s nice to talk to you. So I wanted to go back to a time when you were first starting out planning luxury weddings. What year was that?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> It was 2003 when I started. But I should say: You kind of have to work, unless, I always say, unless your name is Bronson Van Wick. Who&#39;s a real person who&#39;s extremely successful, and you have that kind of name—where it&#39;s like, <em>Oh, Bronson Van Wick</em> . I think you have to sort of work your way up the ranks.<br><br> Does that make sense?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. Like in the movie.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yeah. So it probably took us maybe two or three years before we were really doing luxury weddings. Which at that time, probably anything over 75 was considered luxury.<br><br> And then you get into ultra-luxury, which then was probably anything over a quarter of a million dollars. Which I know sounds like a lot, and to my jaded wedding-planning eyes, it&#39;s like, <em>Eh, it doesn&#39;t get you that far</em> .<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh my God. All right, so let&#39;s say around 2005 you start planning some serious weddings. What is the first request someone made of you that you were like, <em>Oh, okay, okay, okay</em> ?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> I mean, then I&#39;m going to say that it was relatively reasonable, right? It was like: “Could you get me this celebrity singer to come to the wedding?” Like: “I want every table to have an ice sculpture, with the flower arrangement frozen inside of it.”<br><br> You know, it was just weird stuff that they maybe had seen in a magazine. Or [since] this is the dawn of wedding TV, that they might have seen on wedding television. Everything was very celebrity and upscale-emulating.<br><br> At the time, Preston Bailey was like the pinnacle of weddings. And he was doing this thing where he would make animals out of flowers. So, like an eight-foot-tall bear made out of orchids. That kind of thing. And so people would be like: “Could I have little animals made out of roses?”<br><br> So it wasn&#39;t that creative in the beginning. And then as it went on, you started to get weird gag things. Like: “I want to bring up this pony during a toast.” Or I had somebody that was like: “I want to have tattoos set up at the after-party so that my granny can get a tat at my wedding.”<br><br> And so you have a remote tattoo artist coming into town. But the first area that I&#39;d say things started to get unusual, really, was the ceremony. We had a couple that was like: “You have to fly this monk in from Tibet. And then you have to help our rabbi get a visa because we need this one particular rabbi, because he was famous for being like the first gay rabbi in a particular denomination.”<br><br> We had one couple that didn&#39;t want to leave a carbon footprint for their ceremony. That was a big deal at one point. Nobody wanted to leave a carbon footprint. So we used real trees that then we had to find a place to replant them.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> God, Xochitl. I have to stop you and say, like: <em>This is insane.</em> I mean, this is not what I was expecting. I thought it would be like a cute little story and, no, it&#39;s like: <em>fly a Buddhist in from Tibet…</em><br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Oh yeah.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Transplant trees! I mean, this is like the things that you have seen are <em>extra</em> . I mean, what was the thought going through your head? When somebody calls you and they&#39;re like: “I would like a Buddhist flown in from a different country,” what is going through your head?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Well, it was kind of a frog boil. So I always feel like I don&#39;t do that well with these questions, because at the time, you just were like, “Oh, okay. Of course.” Because, the week before, you had just gotten a slightly less crazy request. So they just sort of kept escalating, and you&#39;re like: “Well, obviously we&#39;ve gotta get the monk from Tibet here.”<br><br> And then, you&#39;re like, “Well, is he willing to fly commercial?” That&#39;s like your first question.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh my God. I could hear that in your voice. I could hear that you were lapsing into normal mode where it&#39;s just like, <em>Sure, I&#39;ll do this, and I&#39;ll do that, and I&#39;ll do that.</em> Like as you&#39;re telling me, I&#39;m realizing how otherworldly this is. But for you, it just registers as another thing on your checklist.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yeah. I think that the hardest part about writing about it is sometimes recognizing when things were strange. Do you know what?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yes.是的。<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> You&#39;re like, <em>Wait, okay.这很奇怪。</em> Now that I&#39;m away from it, I can see how that was strange.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right. So what I understand was at first the wedding requests were derivative because there were a lot of wedding magazines. And so people just saw what other people had, and they wanted those things.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Totally. And you had more wedding magazines, which I think is so hard for people to even wrap their heads around.<br><br> But there was <em>Inside Weddings</em> , <em>In Style Weddings</em> , <em>Modern Bride</em> . And then you had <em>The Knot</em> , and then you had Martha Stewart, and then you had regional versions. like, so you would have <em>Brides</em> and then you&#39;d have <em>New York Bride</em> . You&#39;d have <em>The Knot</em> and then you&#39;d have <em>The Knot New York</em> .<br><br> You just had so much bridal content on newsstands. And then—&#39;06, &#39;07—you start getting blogs.<br><br> So now you&#39;ve got digital media. You&#39;ve got print media still happening; you have books. You had Pinterest. You could be doing wedding stuff. You could be watching a wedding movie. You could be going crazy on blogs all night. You could be reading magazines on the subway on your way to and from work. You could be buying advice books and etiquette books and design books. Like, you could spend a small fortune just on bridal media.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I mean, there really was a wedding-industrial complex.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> There was!<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> That&#39;s not a made-up term.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> No, you know,—I think there was a rebellion against the “traditional wedding,” right? There was this overtaking, of like: <em>How can I make this feel like only</em> we <em>would have this wedding?</em>正确的？ I think that there was like a chicken and the egg.<br><br> Blogs came about, and kind of really drove that. Because suddenly it&#39;s not Darcy Miller at Martha Stewart determining whether or not this is good enough to be in print, right? It&#39;s like, <em>I need content</em> . To go up like 10 times a day, right, on this blog.<br><br> And so you were sort of like, <em>Well, what are we going to do?</em> You know, we did this one thing, and it was like pinwheels and calico prints. [ <em>Laughter.</em> ] And I think that was like one of the first weddings—it was like a phase, I call it “The Bunting Years,” where everybody had bunting everywhere. And we were sort of like pioneers in bunting. And I&#39;m obviously quite proud of that.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> [ <em>Laughs.</em> ] Congratulations.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yes, I know. Really I was very, very proud of that. And that wedding—I remember again, I was so proud of this—we had custom-made yarmulkes in denim and calico.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Mm-hmm.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> It was so cute. It was very cute. But like, you know, I think what ends up happening is the &#39;00s—the era when I got into it—was sort of an era of growing flash. And it just kind of kept increasing and increasing and increasing throughout that decade, until the recession. And then we sort of merged into like—weird, I don&#39;t want to say that it was “quiet luxury,” but it was more whispered. It was spent; it was quirky luxury. Quirky luxury.<br><br> Before the recession, finance was a bigger section of the luxury wedding market, but not necessarily people with inherited wealth.<br><br> You know, like they&#39;re probably middle-class people that ended up going to business school, and, you know, they&#39;re spending their Goldman money on a wedding. And they wanted to have nice weddings that would impress their friends.<br><br> And then after the recession, what happened was almost all the clientele in the luxury sector shifted to people with inherited wealth.<br><br> So like: They may have done well themselves, but their parents had also done very well. And that was who then felt comfortable, I think, after this giant shakeup in the economy. These were the people that still felt comfortable spending that kind of money, but they didn&#39;t want people to know they were spending that kind of money.<br><br> So you start to get that twee aesthetic: where everything&#39;s super-custom, but at the same time, it&#39;s not the Plaza with orchids splattered all over the walls, right? It&#39;s like flowers grown on a farm that only grew these flowers for your wedding, right?<br><br> I think we did the very first wedding that Roberta&#39;s ever catered, and we had to bring up all of their pizza ovens. And, you know, it sounds really casual, right? You&#39;re like, “Roberta&#39;s is catering my wedding.”<br><br> And then it&#39;s like: No, they&#39;ve never catered anything before, and we are basically recreating their kitchen in a field. So it&#39;s actually not cheap at all. But the couple wanted to be able to tell people “Roberta&#39;s is doing my catering.”<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right, right. We should say: Roberta&#39;s is a famous hipster pizza place in Bushwick, Brooklyn. And so what are you learning about the ultra-wealthy as you&#39;re going through this? Because it sounds like they go through eras. One era of conspicuous consumption moves into the next era of understated elegance.<br><br> I mean, we like to flatten the motivations and desires of the ultra-rich, but what do you think they wanted? I mean, partly it&#39;s to get into a magazine or a blog?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Well, actually, I would say that I think that is a more middle-class desire, to be honest. Like, I think that the ultra-rich are much more content with the people that were there seeing it. There&#39;s a bit of social media, but there&#39;s a remarkable amount of privacy around this stuff.<br><br> And especially I&#39;d say that trend has even increased since I&#39;ve left. Like in talking to different people still in the business—you know, when I say “ultra luxury,” I&#39;m saying $2, $3, $4 million on a wedding. Like, there is a desire to not necessarily have every single thing sprawled over, and the sense that that makes it more exclusive to the people that were there.<br><br> Exclusivity is a big thing. It&#39;s probably part of the reason why you see so many very wealthy people having tent weddings—because they want to go to a location that nobody has gone to before.正确的？ So maybe that&#39;s like: You&#39;re housed at a hotel, but you&#39;re going to be down by a lake that no one&#39;s ever used for a wedding before. Exclusivity and rarity, and giving guests access to that, is a big part of what I think the ultra-wealthy are trying to achieve with their weddings.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Got it. So for the ultra-wealthy, it&#39;s an air of mystery. Specificity. Exclusivity. And then how does that filter down to everyone else?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> So what&#39;ll happen is—and you know, I spoke with this wonderful photographer, Alan Zapata. He charges I think around $40,000 and $50,000 for a wedding weekend.<br><br> And he&#39;s like: “The No. 1 thing I have to do is get like 10 or 12 images ready to put on social media.” So it&#39;s not that they&#39;re not sharing; it&#39;s just that they&#39;re sharing very selectively. So what happens is these will go out. And in the olden days, maybe a wedding would go in a magazine—like you might see, let&#39;s say, Chelsea Clinton&#39;s wedding, right?<br><br> And <em>People</em> then might do an interview with the person who planned it, Bryan Rafanelli. And Bryan will say, like: “Oh, here&#39;s a way to get Chelsea&#39;s look for less.” And you know, he&#39;ll do a little editorial thing. What happens now is that people see this on social media, and it&#39;s given without any context, right? So you see, let&#39;s say Kim [Kardashian]—I&#39;m thinking of a famous image like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/news/a43070/kanye-west-gives-white-rose-to-kim-valentines-day-2017/">Kim and Kanye [West]&#39;s floral wall</a> . You see it in a magazine; it&#39;s like: “How to Get That Look for Less.” And [it&#39;s] like: Do it with carnations. You know, it was done with roses and orchids, like whatever. And now you end up just seeing it with no context, with no information, with no kind of like, quote unquote, wedding education.<br><br> And so it creates desire in people that are soon to be brides and grooms, and it creates desire without any attachment to knowledge. It&#39;s like, I could see a Chanel gown and know, <em>Well, that&#39;s a very nice gown, but I&#39;m not buying that.</em><br><br>正确的？ But there&#39;s no sense that this is the Chanel of wedding flowers, right?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So because it&#39;s appearing in your feed, it feels utterly attainable. You&#39;re like, <em>Oh, there&#39;s a picture. It&#39;s scrolling down my feed.</em>是的。<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> It&#39;s like the next thing you see. Like your college roommate&#39;s baby shower. It&#39;s mixed in with content of people that are real-life people, but then these are not necessarily even people that you exactly know. And so I think it sort of makes a scramble in the brain, where it&#39;s like, <em>Well, I now need to have this</em> —because it becomes detached from any reality of the wealth that&#39;s supporting that.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> But you know, the mania just keeps transforming, and it doesn&#39;t change anything for the actual couple. It makes it worse, because at first you have all these standard-bearers, like the magazines and the central blogs. And then it just becomes democratized. And so everybody has to do it for themselves.<br><br> So everybody has to create their own perfect photo shoot. That would&#39;ve been, say, a bridal-magazine photo shoot. But you&#39;re expected to somehow do it, create it, and pay for it yourself.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yeah, you know, I&#39;d written a piece about this ages ago about my bra fitter—like the lady where I buy my bras on Atlantic Avenue. And this woman&#39;s been in bras for 40 years, right?<br><br> And I was like, “I go to her because she&#39;s an expert.” I think what has happened in the democratization of imagery, because it&#39;s not really information necessarily, is the demise of expertise. And I don&#39;t know that that&#39;s helped people. I think it&#39;s created more confusion. I think that there&#39;s not necessarily reliable sources to even know what to ask.<br><br> So I always am curious: In that sort of middle tier, how good are those experiences that you&#39;re seeing? Like, I think that people are performing on Instagram and taking out money—you know, for the things that are going to get them attention on the Gram.<br><br> To spend money on choreographies [so] you can do a choreographed dance that&#39;ll get you hits on TikTok. Like, I wonder what these guests are eating. I wonder what they&#39;re drinking. You know? I wonder what the experience is on the other side, and I wonder how much people care.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Right. Because you have to skimp somewhere.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Right? And that&#39;s also the stuff that really costs the most. Giving a very nice meal; making sure people have transportation to and from the ceremony, back to the reception, back to the hotel after they&#39;ve been drinking all night. Like, that&#39;s the stuff that starts to really add up. But you don&#39;t see that on the Gram, right?<br><br> <strong><em>[MUSIC]</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> After the break, we check in with a bespoke pyrotechnics expert on how to give your wedding the grand entrance of your dreams…<br><br> Just kidding. We&#39;re going to discuss why we can&#39;t seem to quit the ever-bigger, ever-fancier, and ever-more-expensive wedding.<br><br> <strong><em>[MUSIC]</em></strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So, we&#39;ve talked about how couples see these luxury weddings on Instagram. And then, how does that have real effects on their typical wedding?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> So I think it sort of trickles down, and then people want. You know, I discovered this did not exist when I was still in the business. But two kinds of cottage industries have come up.<br><br> Wedding styling. You know, like in terms of the way you think of a stylist that&#39;s going to get you ready for a runway if you&#39;re a celebrity. Wedding styling has been around for maybe 20 years or so, but it was a very exclusive service, right? Like it was really for the upper tier of the market.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> When you say “wedding styling,” I just think someone comes in and does your hair—<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> No, so this is like: “I&#39;m going to help you find the dress, the shoes, the accessory.” Now it&#39;s expanded to the look that&#39;s going to coordinate that for your engagement photos, for the rehearsal dinner. What are you going to wear for the day-after brunch? Like, if you have an excursion during your wedding weekend, what are you going to wear for that? So it&#39;s like a whole series of “bridal looks.”<br><br> And then the other little strange thing that I wasn&#39;t expecting at all is: Social-media professionals to come and sort of document your wedding specifically for social media.<br><br> So they will be on TikTok; they&#39;ll be making reels. They&#39;ll be posting up select photos like in real time. And one of the services will “develop a strategy” for your wedding. And like their tagline was: “Because the day you spent 14 months planning should be seen by the world.”<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh my God. No. I mean: Is this trickle-down luxury to you? To someone inside, [is] it a good thing or a bad thing? To me, it&#39;s very stressful. Just hearing you lay it out. I&#39;m really glad I&#39;m not getting married right now, but what do you think?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> To me, I think it&#39;s pretty stressful. I guess I could say I get worried about society, right? And what living virtually has done to us in terms of our priorities, about real life versus appearances, if that makes sense. And so I&#39;m not against weddings—you know, I had a relatively low-budget [wedding]. I&#39;m not married anymore, but I never regret having that wedding because, you know, my grandfather walked me down the aisle. We did the dance. I have those memories. I have these great photos of me and my best friends who were still my best friends. I remember I have these memories of us getting ready together, and doing the whole thing.<br><br> And this was great. But it was not only a different time economically when I did that—that was around &#39;04 or &#39;05—but it was also a different mindset. And that sense is certainly not pervading the general population of the economy right now.<br><br> And so I think that&#39;s why I&#39;m sort of shocked at the way in which money&#39;s getting spent sort of flippantly. More people are taking on wedding debt now than ever before, and through personal loans too. Like, it&#39;s not even just credit-card debt; it&#39;s taking out personal loans to finance or supplement their weddings at sometimes up to 30 percent interest rates.<br><br> And knowing that—is it for people&#39;s experience? Is it for the memory, or is it for the Gram? And that part makes me a little nervous or uncomfortable, I should say.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. I&#39;m really confused by why we just cling to this tradition. Like as you&#39;re talking, I&#39;m thinking: Has not one single couple, when you were wedding planning, just said “No”? Like, “This is not us. This is nothing to do with our life. Like we&#39;re putting ourselves in aspic, like getting this perfect old tradition, and to the max—but this is not us, and I don&#39;t want to do it.”<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Well, probably. It&#39;s self-selected by the people that came in the door, right? I will say, I did have one couple; they called off their wedding because the mom of the bride was so particular and worried about what people thought and how things were going to be perceived. And they started to bicker. And they ended up, they were like, “We don&#39;t want to do this. This is terrible. We don&#39;t even want to be together anymore.” And they called off the wedding. And I remember running into them, separately, like a year later. You know, they were not together. And like: “I think it&#39;s probably the best thing that we did. The wedding was just too much.”<br><br> And then after that, like two years later, they ended up just eloping. They got back together; they eloped. And the desire to have this perfect wedding that represented “them as a couple” just was too much. Literally, they were like, “I can&#39;t do it.”<br><br> But I think it was also money that everybody had, right? So the calculus was different. I think I&#39;m sort of just disconcerted to a certain extent at, like: What is the point of making it a visually stunning event if you know that you&#39;re going to be kind of paying that back for forever?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Because you just get one second of—<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> It&#39;s a dopamine hit, right?<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. Well, what do you think? Like, marriages are so different. Fewer people are getting married. Women&#39;s roles are so different. And we keep injecting this one tradition with so much money, so much importance. Like, so much perfection. It&#39;s really odd.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> So, you know, the wedding in America the way that we think about it, right? The white dress and the reception. That sort of all emerged in the &#39;50s post-war, right? Like, when we had a middle class.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> And it was this kind of way to say: “Here we are as a family.”正确的？ Like for the bride&#39;s family to be like: “We are in the middle class.” And so the niceness of the wedding was a performative way for your neighbors and your community, your church community, your residential community to see, like: <em>Oh, okay.</em> Like: <em>Look what they were able to do for their daughter.</em> And there was a certain aspect of the lady&#39;s hurrah, right? The bride&#39;s hurrah of showing herself off.<br><br> And I think what&#39;s funny is that as we&#39;ve been able to sort of let go of ... like, I think the number of people that anticipate buying a home has declined, right?<br><br> We&#39;ve let go of so many “middle-class American aspirations,” but we haven&#39;t been able to let go of the wedding. It&#39;s not perceived as a luxury. Weddings, period, <em>are</em> a luxury. Whether you are in the luxury end of the market or not, they are a luxury start to finish.<br><br> But there&#39;s something that we have not accepted as a luxury. They feel like an entitlement. Like: If you are going to marry, and by that I mean legally do it, then if you are an American and you consider yourself middle class, you should be able to have a nice wedding.<br><br> And I think that&#39;s where a lot of the resentment of the cost comes in. It&#39;s like, “You running your business is stopping me from having my nice wedding that I&#39;m entitled to.”<br><br> And I think that there&#39;s a real reluctance to give up the dream.<br><br> It&#39;s one of the few middle-class dreams that I think people don&#39;t want to give up. People have given up on college, and I don&#39;t think that they want to give up on weddings.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> But I mean, we have definitely transformed the traditional marriage. Like, if you had a friend who had a very stereotypical 1950s-style marriage where the gender roles were very rigidly prescribed, you might be confused. We just don&#39;t do that anymore. Like, women&#39;s roles are dismantled. But—we refuse, we will not dismantle the proposal, the wedding dress. The wedding. So many things about the wedding are so traditional.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> One of the things that I think is probably the funniest to me is that we did a pop-up wedding chapel with The Knot the weekend that gay marriage passed in New York. Okay. And we had two or three little ceremony setups, and I think [something] like 20 couples got married in Central Park that day. And I remember being like, <em>This is so cute.</em><br><br> Like, this is bad for business. But I was like, wouldn&#39;t this be great if in expanding what marriage [is], who can get married, we expand what could be a nice wedding. And then instead you fast-forward 20 years, and it&#39;s just like: Everybody&#39;s still having these super-traditional weddings.<br><br> [ <em>Laughter.</em> ]<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> I was going to say, I&#39;ve been to many a gay wedding—<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> I was going to say: I feel like the gay weddings that I&#39;ve been to have been just as, if not more, elaborate—right?—than any of the hetero weddings. So I almost think it&#39;s hilarious that when you think about the total deconstruct of that 1950s stereotype of what a marriage is like, we still can&#39;t get away from the wedding.<br><br> And I think it&#39;s got romance attached to it. And I think there is sort of this idea, again, of in a funny way, it is not the right to live together in relationship.<br><br> And you know, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://youtu.be/po9-NWhk1Qo?t=42">it&#39;s that great Sondheim song like about marriage. Like, “It&#39;s the little things you do together.”</a> It&#39;s not about that part. It&#39;s literally about the right to have a wedding.<br><br> [ <em>Laughter.</em> ]<br><br> It&#39;s like the fight for your right to party: like literally. And so I think that in some ways we&#39;ve conflated a good wedding with good marriage.<br><br> And I do think we&#39;ve become obsessed, in this country, with celebrity. And I think it&#39;s sort of a performative way to now have both. You know, show off some class status. But more than anything, I think people are like: It&#39;s a way to sort of have celebrity [status] for a day. Like, attainable celebrity for a day.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So in the way that you&#39;d want to, you used to want to be a princess for the day, or royalty—<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yes. Now you&#39;re like a Kardashian for the day, right? And what does that come with? It comes with luxury: It comes with designer clothes, it comes with a glam squad. It comes with a camera following you around the entire day. It comes with all these things. And like, people don&#39;t want to give that up.<br><br> So it&#39;s a tiny version of celebrity. I think what&#39;s funny to me when I kept thinking about it is people will sit and like hem and haw about like, “Oh, can we afford to get a car? Can we afford to do this? Can we afford to like, send our kid to this school?” And in the meantime, they&#39;ll be like, for no hands down, “Just borrow $50,000. Let&#39;s have this wedding.”<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Oh my. Right. You know, in the Jennifer Lopez movie, which I just rewatched last night, she herself is chasing the dream. Like, she wants to have her own wedding. And in your novel <em>Olga Dies Dreaming</em> , which I loved, Olga ends up with a guy, and there&#39;s no wedding in sight.<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> No.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> And she seems, like, way more herself. Is there some message I&#39;m supposed to read into that? Like, just forget the wedding?<br><br> Where did you land, because you wrote this novel when you&#39;ve essentially exited wedding planning, right?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yes; I&#39;d exited. And you know, I think she was commitment-phobic in the beginning of the novel and ends up with somebody, but she&#39;s got serious commitment issues. And I think I&#39;ve landed on: The relationship is so much more important than the performance of the relationship.<br><br> I love a good party. I think, if you&#39;ve got the cash—who doesn&#39;t love a good party? But I don&#39;t know that the wedding has to be the reason for the party. A party for no reason&#39;s also kind of fun.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> So: Skip the wedding; just have a party. That&#39;s your mantra now?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Yeah. I still support parties.<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Yeah. Pro-party. Okay! Well, you are working on a new novel. There&#39;s going to be a cover reveal soon. Is there anything else you want to say about it?<br><br> <strong>Gonzalez:</strong> Oh, it&#39;s about power and creative couples. It&#39;s a first-generation art-history student in an Ivy League school who discovers a forgotten female genius artist who was murdered by her husband 20 years before. And I&#39;m very excited about it. It&#39;s a little bit of a mystery.<br><br> It&#39;s a little bit of a campus novel. It&#39;s a little ghosty. And it&#39;s called <em>Anita de Monte Laughs Last</em> .<br><br> <strong>Rosin:</strong> Ooh.惊人的。 Can&#39;t wait.

On <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/magazine/out-of-my-mouth-comes-unimpeachable-manly-truth.html">assignment</a> for <i>The New York Times</i> , I&#39;d agreed to stay in a hotel room for seven days (leaving only for a brief daily swim) while watching Russian state television. Three monitors were arrayed in front of my bed constantly blasting the state-owned Channel 1 and Rossiya 1 networks, as well as the Gazprom-owned NTV. By the end of my stay, I had turned from a happy-go-lucky novelist into a squeaking gerbil of a man, psychologically compromised and barely sure of what constituted reality.<br><br> Now, slightly more than eight years later, I have decided to replicate this experiment. On the one hand, the length of my sentence has been commuted to five days from seven; on the other hand, since Russia&#39;s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, the state&#39;s propaganda has become even more loud, brash, and genocidal, making any length of exposure to it psychologically problematic. But in some way, Russians were preparing for the bloodshed of innocent Ukrainians as far back as 2014, if not earlier. The images of Ukrainians as a bunch of Nazis hoodwinked by the West were readily presented on Russian television. Back then, I did not want to believe they could lead to the massacres of Bucha and Irpin. Today, I know better.<br><br>第一天<br><br>I arrive at the Public Hotel on the Lower East Side on a cold day this past April. My room has nice views of most of the downtown-Manhattan skyline, which lights up in flashes of pink and purple as the sun begins to set over New Jersey. But I am not here to look out on the World Trade Center tower or the New Museum right below the hotel. I am here to suffer and learn. I flick on each monitor in turn: Channel 1, Rossiya 1 (broadcast outside Russia as RTR-Planeta), and NTV. I settle into my large, comfortable bed; order a pisco sour to be sent to my room (the hotel&#39;s restaurant is Peruvian); and rub my eyes in anticipation. It begins.<br><br> The first thing you notice when you switch on Russian TV is its totemic fascination with the swastika, which regularly appears on one of my screens. Sometimes it is taken from footage of the Nazi era, sometimes from purported videos of the Ukrainian far right. Sometimes it is on the news, sometimes in a documentary, sometimes in a TV drama. By my third or fourth swastika of the day, I start to believe that when the symbol is shown this often, it is not done so entirely with disparagement, but with a subconscious appeal to authoritarian power and to the state&#39;s own fascism.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/putin-caught-in-his-own-trap/674524/">Read: Putin is caught in his own trap</a><br><br> A lot of time on all three networks is given over to flashy “newsroom” sets populated by older men in blazers who scream about the West. <i>Kto Protiv</i> (“Who Is Against”), on Rossiya 1, is one such program. The subject matter is often akin to what one sees on far-right television in the US, the exemplar of which is Fox News. But Russian state television is several degrees to the right of Fox, or even of its more lunatic competitor, Newsmax, although Tucker Carlson, the onetime king of televised white supremacy, is frequently shown on Russian TV as well—or, at least, he was back in April. On tonight&#39;s <i>Kto Protiv</i> , Sweden and Finland are presented as having been coerced into joining NATO. A panelist mispronounces the term <i>LGBTQ+</i> to general laughter. (“Is it plus or minus?” another panelist asks.) Afterward, an “economic expert” tells the audience that transgender bodies have begun to fall apart. No evidence is cited for any of this; it&#39;s merely people talking or, as some like to say, “asking questions.”<br><br> On NTV, another staple of Russian television appears: the dysfunctional-family showcase. “They beat me, tied up my hands, starved me,” a woman from Volgograd cries. “My grandmother beat my face with a metal stick.” The beaten woman, now in late-middle age, is the daughter of a mother of five, who rejected all or most of her children after giving birth to them. The elderly mother who abandoned her children is presented. A woman with a piece of jewelry around her neck resembling a thick chain screams from the audience: “Why did you give birth to so many children if you didn&#39;t have a husband or money? So that they would be orphans?”<br><br> Meanwhile, on Channel 1, a black-and-white documentary shows Khrushchev greeting a group of cosmonauts. The glories of the Soviet past on one screen are contrasted with the realities of the present on another. You may ask why a government obsessed with propaganda would be showing programs about broken families. One reason is that audiences of all nations enjoy watching their fellow citizens in pain. Another is to remind the people that life in the lower depths is a time-honored tradition. The show is presented by two dapper male hosts who are part of a well-trod Russian-TV theme: Provincials in distress are interviewed by stylish urban hosts, as if they are Chekhovian peasants being judged before the district court in czarist times. Subconsciously, shows like these teach poorer and older Russians (the kind of people who regularly watch state television) that they should be ashamed before their betters and that they cannot expect much from life or their immediate families.<br><br> “My husband drank,” the elderly negligent mother explains on NTV. She was a tram driver. Her husband worked in a factory. “He went to prison for three years for stealing a coat. Then he divorced me.” Whereas the manned space flight on Channel 1 was a great accomplishment, NTV is presenting the eternal Russia, which will remain when the glories of the past are left to the history books.<br><br> The old woman crawls on the floor. “Forgive me! Forgive me!” she cries to her children. Now we have left the pages of Chekhov and arrived in Dostoyevsky Land. Some of the audience is in tears. “My fate has been so difficult!” the old mother cries out to them, and to her many abandoned children.<br><br> On Rossiya 1, the topics of Finland and American transgender people are not yet exhausted. On one screen, men are screaming about geopolitics, while on another women are screaming about their destroyed personal lives.<br><br> The show about the dysfunctional family cuts to a commercial for a fast-food chain that has replaced McDonald&#39;s after the sanctions for the Russian invasion of Ukraine were imposed. The copycat McDonald&#39;s is offering an unconvincing-looking “beeeeg speshal roast beef,” as an announcer describes it.<br><br> On Rossiya 1, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is giving one of his usual bombastic speeches: “They want to cancel our country, as they like to say. They&#39;re trying to cancel our country for pursuing its own politics. The West has long groomed Ukraine … Just like Germany invaded Russia.” The television shows another Nazi parade, a long sea of swastikas and chanting in German.<br><br> Later on the channel, we see images of Russian President Vladimir Putin striding through gilded Kremlin halls, while US President Joe Biden is shown tripping on the stairs of Air Force One. It&#39;s an advertisement for a show titled <i>Moscow. Kremlin. Putin.</i><br><br> It&#39;s only 9 pm, but I am exhausted. I have drained two glasses of pisco sour and eaten my ceviche from the hotel&#39;s restaurant, and am blindly watching a movie called <i>Razplata</i> (“Payback”), which seems to be about a drunken man who beats his wife. My vision is getting hazy and my eyes can barely see what&#39;s happening on the three monitors, but I can sense that it is a triptych of a nation that has no idea what it is supposed to be.<br><br>第二天<br><br>“Not my King!” The day&#39;s news begins with anti-monarchist demonstrations in the UK “At least no one is throwing eggs at him like last time,” the NTV announcer intones as King Charles III is booed. In addition to the constant footage of anti-war and pro-Russian demonstrations in Germany, Russian TV is obsessed with the perfidy of the “Anglo-Saxons.” Here the Royal Family is criticized for a variety of sins, such as colonialism in Africa and the 3 million pounds King Charles supposedly received from a Qatari sheikh. Although Russian propaganda normally skews far right, its producers are able to pivot quickly from feigning horror at transgendered people to promoting a kind of Soviet-flavored anti-colonialism. Surely something will appeal to Misha from Murmansk or Vanya from Vladivostok, or any of the more than 100 million viewers who spend an average of almost four hours a day digesting this spicy gruel.<br><br> After the booing of King Charles, the national weather forecast features temperatures in Donetsk and Melitopol in addition to Yalta, all cities stolen from Ukraine. I note that the city of Kherson, liberated by the Ukrainian army, does not make an appearance.<br><br> It&#39;s the weekend, and Channel 1 is showing an endless run of old Soviet movies and army choirs singing about glory. But NTV is skewing younger with a show about women being stalked by ex-lovers. “He&#39;s a professional boxer and he punched me several times,” a woman says of her former boyfriend. “He has a very aggressive nature.” A model is being blackmailed over sex videos by her ex. “Smartphones have made stalking easy,” the announcer intones. “He threatened to knock my teeth out,” another woman says, and we are treated to an array of horrifying bruises. The program notes that stalking of exes by spurned lovers is a problem in the US and Germany as well.<br><br> This may be true, but after watching Russian television for less than 24 hours, I am starting to see a through line here, which is the consistent presence of violence in Russian shows, usually committed against women and children. The verb meaning “to hit” comes up constantly, which makes sense in a country where men encounter horrific hazing in the military as well as a cruel and violent penal system. In 2017 the Duma even passed a law decriminalizing domestic abuse that does not result in the victim being treated in a hospital.<br><br> There&#39;s an ad break for a male anti-impotence drug called “the Emperor&#39;s Secret,” supposedly made in China out of various fungi. “The Emperor&#39;s Secret can be mixed with alcohol,” the announcer helpfully advises the Russian male.<br><br> Next up, NTV introduces an American named John McIntyre who fought with the Ukrainians but then fled to Russia. He has been described as mentally unstable by fellow soldiers and commanders and was allegedly pushed out of the Ukrainian army for incompetence, but in Russia he is a prized asset, proudly wearing his Che Guevara baseball cap and T-shirt. The program intimates that it was a right-wing Ukrainian battalion that caused the well-known massacres in Bucha and Irpin, and not the Russian soldiers whose campaign of rape, execution, and terror was well documented.<br><br> “Are there people like you in the States?” the interviewer asks McIntyre. “There are many pro-Russian Americans,” the young man replies. “American intelligence, they own the media machines. Most people watch CNN, but Fox has the most objective positions.”<br><br> “Their voices are getting louder!” an announcer on a Rossiya 1 newscast booms as older Germans are shown marching in a pro-Russia demonstration. “NATO out of Ukraine!” they chant. “US and CIA out of Ukraine!” Afterward, an attractive young female correspondent brings cakes to Russian soldiers at the front. The war may be brutal, but, for Misha from Murmansk, it can also be sexy and exciting.<br><br>第三天<br><br>Channel 1 is stepping up its game in the propaganda Olympics with a “documentary” series called <i>The Age of the USSR</i> , which blends animation and old footage. The Russian language, the announcer tells us, has no word for “loser,” but instead has <i>neudachnik</i> , literally “unlucky person.” “The loser is guilty for what he hasn&#39;t achieved,” the announcer explains. “The <i>neudachnik</i> is not guilty of a lack of achievement, just a lack of fortune, and he deserves sympathy.” Hence, Russia, a country of poor roads, decaying houses, and abysmal life expectancy, is not a nation of losers who lack achievement, but simply those upon whom fortune has not smiled. In other words: Don&#39;t blame Putin for the mess we live in.<br><br> The program then pivots to Ukraine. “The history of Ukraine begins with the Slavs,” the announcer says. “The territory of Ukraine passed between Catholic and Orthodox hands. &#39;Ukraina&#39; means &#39;the edge of.&#39; The word first appears in the 12th century.” The program takes the view, per Putin&#39;s own “academic work” on the subject, that Ukraine has no history of its own, only the common history of the Slavs. “Their national character is Russian, only in the south [meaning Ukraine] it comes with increased aggression … ability for betrayal, and infantilism.”<br><br> And then the genocidal rhetoric is amped up with an animation showing a half-naked drunk Ukrainian in a pigsty (the actual pig is snorting nearby). The Ukrainian is shown with a haircut featuring a long lock of hair. This hair symbolism refers to the <i>khokhol</i> , a slur that Russians use against Ukrainians. It is equivalent to the worst kind of anti-Semitic and racist slurs. The image of the drunken Ukrainian with his <i>khokhol</i> haircut is no less eliminationist than the “hook-nosed Jew controlling the world” imagery of the Third Reich.<br><br> Meanwhile on NTV, more German grannies are chanting “for peace” in a pro-Russia march, participating, whether they realize it or not, in what amounts to their own Nuremberg rally.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/ukraine-victory-russia-defeat/674112/">Read: It&#39;s not enough for Ukraine to win. Russia has to lose.</a><br><br> As the day continues, NTV presents a documentary entitled <i>I Was Zelensky&#39;s Filth</i> . A young imprisoned woman is accused of trying to bomb Mariupol&#39;s city hall, after the battered city held a sham election in favor of joining Russia. “Mariupol is a place of glory for Russian forces and shame for the Kiev führer,” the announcer declares. That führer, of course, is none other than Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky himself, a Jew whose relatives perished in the Holocaust. The show visits the apartment of the supposed terrorist, which is hilariously staged with an American flag and Nazi memorabilia. Can Sasha from Samara possibly believe this nonsense?<br><br> The program breaks for a commercial for Prostricum 100, another erectile-dysfunction supplement. The bottle seems to feature the drawing of a prostate. Meanwhile, on Rossiya 1 news, we learn that German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz has “fully committed himself to America. Germany can&#39;t deal with the rising price of energy. The Greens are to blame. Germany will be turned into Kenya soon.”<br><br> Geopolitics takes up an inordinate amount of airtime on Russian TV. Russian viewers are probably subjected to more images of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and European Union Commission President Ursula von der Leyen than their American or European counterparts. The anger at the West is palpable and, as with everything in Russia, deeply misogynist. An NTV host calls Von der Leyen “Macron&#39;s girlfriend” and notes that she has dry skin.<br><br> Meanwhile, Russia&#39;s new Best Friend Forever is Xi Jinping of China. He is presented as a virile and well-armed world leader. Many programs feature Chinese jets seemingly headed for Taiwan. Perhaps to make up for Russia&#39;s increasing vassal status in relation to China, the Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko is presented as Russia&#39;s own pet vassal and Putin&#39;s funny sidekick. “Belarus comes to us so many times,” a presenter jokes, “they painted a red carpet on the airport tarmac instead of rolling one out.” (Since June, Lukashenko has gotten a spring back in his step after supposedly mediating the end to Yevgeny Prigozhin&#39;s attempted putsch.)<br><br> Rossiya 1 is broadcasting <i>Moscow. Kremlin. Putin.</i> In today&#39;s episode, Putin visits a train factory! The workers at the factory are shown losing their ability to speak in front of their leader, quaking before the “boss,” as the presenters call him. “Don&#39;t hurry,” Putin says kindly to a worker who looks like he has soiled his pants. “We&#39;re just talking.”<br><br>第 4 天<br><br>There is a sadness to watching this much Russian television. I have started drinking earlier and have switched from pisco sours to vodka martinis. A part of me wants to die.<br><br> But not before I catch Maria Butina&#39;s new show on Channel 1. Butina is famous for being arrested and jailed as an unregistered Russian foreign agent in the United States. Once she was deported from the US, she became a member of Russia&#39;s parliament and, of course, the host of her own TV program. (“Today&#39;s program is brought to you by Erecton Activ. Every woman wants to be near a strong man, strong in every way. Only 2,999 rubles.”)<br><br> Today, the redheaded Butina, wearing an equally red blouse and suit pants, decides to talk about Hillary Clinton. Wait, what? Who still cares about Hillary Clinton? Apparently, Butina and Tanya from Taganrog still do.<br><br> Tense music begins. According to the program, Clinton laughed “hysterically” when she was shown pictures of the death of Muammar Qaddafi. “What kind of monster responds to a person&#39;s death like that?” Butina asks. A “psychiatrist” appears and says, “Yes, she&#39;s a monster. But it&#39;s because she has had to compete with men.”<br><br> Donald Trump, whom Russian television adores, is shown calling her “unstable.” “What an awful woman,” the former US president says.<br><br> “Hillary Clinton,” the chyron reads. “A shark floating belly up?”<br><br> A so-called expert on America is produced to diagnose Hillary&#39;s early years: “She wore big glasses, she had terrible teeth, and then she threw herself at Bill Clinton.” But Hillary is just the appetizer to the entrée of evil that really controls the strings of world government. That man is of course George Soros. “He helped the Gestapo arrest his own co-religionists and then take away their own possessions,” an announcer says to chilling background music. “George Soros. The spider.”<br><br> Of course, the image of Jew as vermin or as a spider holding the world in its web is typical and, frankly, not even very imaginative anti-Semitic propaganda. But as I watch Butina&#39;s show, I remember that my own grandfather was a Jew born in Ukraine who died fighting Germany&#39;s fascist armies during the siege of Leningrad. A decade after his death, another fascist named Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin was born in the city my grandfather died defending. Watching Butina and her garden-variety anti-Semitism feels like a terrible desecration of his memory.<br><br> Meanwhile, on NTV&#39;s news program, Elon Musk declares in a clip, “All news is propaganda. People have to decide for themselves.” Russian state television could not have said it better.<br><br>第五天<br><br>I can almost taste my freedom. The weather is improving, spring is finally here, and all of New York seems to be beckoning me to escape my luxurious prison cell. But I also feel overwhelming disgust, as if there&#39;s a thick layer of dirt behind my shirt collar.<br><br> I watch a show called <i>For Men / For Women</i> , in which a woman is attacked on the street by her ex-husband, who, with the aid of his relatives, also kidnaps her little son. “I fell on the asphalt, and he is holding me down and beating me,” the woman says. “I lost my breast milk. I went to the police. The police didn&#39;t do anything.”<br><br> “Nikolai drank a lot and still drinks a lot,” the woman continues. “He gets aggressive and he takes it out on people. I was his victim and had to obey him.”<br><br> The poor woman&#39;s lament reminds me of the show I watched a few days prior (it now seems like a lifetime ago) about women being stalked and beaten by their ex-lovers. “He has a very aggressive nature,” a woman said of her former lover, the professional boxer. As does Russia in 2023. So many of the shows I&#39;ve watched during the past five days were obsessed with the West, with our Clintons and Soroses and Von der Leyens. Russia is the spurned lover with the “very aggressive nature” taking out his inhumanity on the innocent neighbor next door. Despite all the posturing and doublespeak, Russian television announces as much to the world. Whether on the airwaves or, perhaps someday, at the Hague, the evidence has been clearly presented.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 11:10:44 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/russian-state-tv-putin-propaganda/674755/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/07/russian-state-tv-putin-propaganda/674755/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Being Anxious or Sad Does Not Make You Mentally Ill]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> We easily pathologize bad feelings, but they&#39;re a normal, even healthy part of human experience. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/tkeNBgph_QyHBm8t_TTrTi1I77E=/0x0:3000x1688/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/HowToBuildALife146/original.jpg" alt="一个人看着自己在水中的倒影" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Jan Buchczik</figcaption></figure> <i data-stringify-type="italic">Want to stay current with Arthur&#39;s writing? <a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/how-to-build-a-life/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/how-to-build-a-life/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up</a> to get an email every time a new column comes out.</i><br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">f you have</span> recently been told that you have a mental-health malady such as depression or anxiety, you are far from alone. The rates at which these diagnoses are being made have exploded over the past few years. A 2021 literature review in <i>The Lancet</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02143-7/fulltext">measured</a> a 26 percent increase in anxiety disorder worldwide during the first year of the pandemic, and a 28 percent increase in depressive disorder. Such symptoms are much higher among some groups, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefire.org/news/blogs/eternally-radical-idea/coddling-afterword-part-1-gen-zs-mental-health-continues">according</a> to the 2021 publication of an extended afterword to the 2018 book <i>The Coddling of the American Mind</i> , by the psychologist Jonathan Haidt and journalist Greg Lukianoff. For example, among politically progressive white women in their 20s, more than half said in early 2020 that they&#39;d been told that they had a mental-health condition.<br><br> The coronavirus outbreak and its associated lockdowns isolated people, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/03/02/mental-health-and-the-pandemic-what-u-s-surveys-have-found/">causing</a> widespread increases in feelings of loneliness and distress, which still persist. But <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2666560321000438">some studies</a> have shown that the phenomenon began before the pandemic, so other reasons for it must exist as well. One commonly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.verywellmind.com/social-media-and-depression-5085354">identified</a> factor is excessive social-media use, which can substitute for in-person relationships, intensify social comparison, and elevate loneliness. Still another reason (which I have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/activism-depression-happiness-volunteering/674002/">written</a> about previously) is the increase in political polarization, which can lead people to hate one another—feelings of depression and anxiety are elevated in those who direct hatred toward out-groups.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/social-media-teen-mental-health-crisis-research-limitations/674371/">Read: No one knows exactly what social media is doing to teens</a><br><br> But one other explanation is emerging for the huge increase in population-wide estimates of mental-health diagnoses: the tendency to see stress and sadness as evidence that something is <i>broken</i> inside you. For many who have them, of course, anxiety and depression are medical problems that absolutely require treatment. But other cases exist for which we may have inadvertently pathologized perfectly healthy emotions—leading many people to believe they are ill simply because they&#39;re reacting normally to the challenges in their lives.<br><br> W <span class="smallcaps">hen physical disease</span> is concerned, most of us make two basic assumptions. First, feeling <i>bad</i> is evidence of pathology. You never go to a doctor and say, “I&#39;ve been feeling weirdly good these past few weeks, so I figured I&#39;d better come to get it checked out.” Yet we all know that feeling pain or discomfort is not necessarily a good indicator of what might be ailing you. Often, such sensations are an indication that your body is protecting you—for example, you tweaked your back and it wants you to baby it for a few days. You probably have even experienced some beneficial stress—because, for instance, you worked out harder than normal, and now you have sore muscles.<br><br> The second assumption we make is that ailments are purely binary: You either have them or you don&#39;t. So you might say, “I have prediabetes,” and although that sounds very specific and clear, suggesting that a reliable treatment must exist, what it really means is that you have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/prediabetes/diagnosis-treatment/drc-20355284">a glycated hemoglobin level from 5.7 percent to 6.4 percent</a> . Meeting that diagnostic criterion leads doctors to think that, without some changes to your diet and lifestyle, your level might rise more and create significant health problems for you. But as a condition, it&#39;s not in itself an ailment in any straightforward sense.<br><br> As with many health issues, this is a case of a “dial,” not a “switch.” We treat the condition as if it were an on-off switch because we organize diagnostic medicine neatly around the classification of diseases, or <i>nosology</i> , to use the technical term.<br><br> These assumptions have become embedded in mental-health treatment in ways that muddle reality even more. Positive mental health is defined by professionals and laypeople alike in no small part by “feeling good,” which means not experiencing too many negative emotions such as anger, sadness, fear, and disgust. But as one social psychologist, responding to normative assumptions about the value of psychological health, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.christweedt.com/BoorseDiseaseIllness.pdf">asked</a> in a philosophy paper back in the 1950s, “Good for what? Good in terms of middle class ethics? Good for democracy? For the continuation of the social <i>status quo</i> ? For the individual&#39;s happiness? For mankind?”<br><br> The nosological binary is even more problematic in diagnosing mental disorders. According to the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-disorders">World Health Organization</a> , “In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder.” In other words, seven in eight people aren&#39;t living with a mental disorder. But how would you find out whether you are the one or among the seven? Take any online test for depressive symptoms and you will almost certainly have a positive score, suggesting some degree of depression. But is that level a “disorder” as such? The answer is ultimately subjective: It depends on whom you consult, and whether the symptoms are judged to be interfering with your life “too much.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/02/depression-screening-primary-care/462933/">Read: Why depression screenings should be part of routine checkups</a><br><br> More and more researchers are pointing out the high costs of such assumptions. To begin with, high levels of stress and sadness are completely normal, even beneficial. They are a natural reaction to ordinary events in life, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/susceptibility-to-mental-illness-may-have-helped-humans-adapt-over-the-millennia/">a response that evolved</a> to help us behave in useful, functional ways. Again, these emotions can be too active, but everyone will have good reasons to feel stress, which helps us react to an event with focus and energy when needed, just as we respond with appropriate sadness when we experience a loss or disappointment.<br><br> In fact, people routinely don&#39;t want to “feel good,” and respond to failure or threat by regulating their emotions downward (in a “negative” direction). For example, in one <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/56f5c928356fb063f3e181fb/t/56f5e8db20c64796d519e1e7/1458956508103/Tamir_Ford_2012_landlord.pdf">experiment</a> where participants negotiated with a stranger, researchers confirmed that many of them wanted to feel some degree of anger to be more effective in doing so.<br><br> The dial-versus-switch problem has led some health scholars such as Allan V. Horwitz and Jerome C. Wakefield to assert that the current epidemic of depression is at least in part the result of “diagnostic inflation.” In their 2007 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-loss-of-sadness-how-psychiatry-transformed-normal-sorrow-into-depressive-disorder-allan-v-horwitz/9780199921577?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Loss of Sadness: How Psychiatry Transformed Normal Sorrow Into Depressive Disorder</i></a> , they argue that by assuming that feeling bad <i>is</i> bad, we conflate normal sadness with clinical depression.<br><br> Some researchers go so far as to claim that the whole system of psychiatric diagnosis should be scrapped. Writing in the <i>International Journal of Clinical and Health Psychology</i> ,<i> </i>这<i> </i>British psychiatrist Sami Timimi <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S169726001400009X">argued</a> that a label such as “depressive disorder” or “generalized anxiety disorder” “does not aid treatment decisions, is associated with worsening long-term prognosis for mental health problems, and imposes Western beliefs about mental distress on other cultures.”<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C. Brooks? Join him and a selection of today&#39;s best writers and boldest voices at The Atlantic Festival on September 28 and 29. Get your pass <a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/live/atlantic-festival-2023/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/live/atlantic-festival-2023/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">here</a> .</em><br><br> None of this means that psychiatric or psychological help with emotions is a bad idea. As my Harvard colleague, the psychiatrist Robert Waldinger, reminded me, a problem of underdiagnosis applies as much as one of overdiagnosis, because millions of people—in the US and around the world—lack access to basic mental-health care. Even those of us who do not have a disorder can benefit from help with emotional management, just as physically healthy people can benefit from learning ways to stay fit and take care of their body.<br><br> The point is that feeling discomfort and seeking help should not necessarily mean that you are <i>ill</i> . You might instead be emotionally healthy but coping with unusual pressures, a period of change, or just, well, life on Earth.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">f you are</span> concerned about your mental health, you should of course seek medical help. As Waldinger put it to me, “Never suffer alone.” You may benefit from any of a variety of treatments, including talking cures and prescription drugs. But here are three things to remember, especially in your lower moments.<br><br> <b>1. We are all anxious and sad.</b><br> Decades ago, the researcher Christopher Boorse uncovered a seemingly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.christweedt.com/BoorseDiseaseIllness.pdf">strange fact</a> : By the ordinary criteria for mental disorders, the population at large is no less disturbed than the population of clinical patients. In truth, this isn&#39;t so strange when we recall that distress is a dial, not a switch, and no one&#39;s dial is at zero. The first Noble Truth of Buddhism is, after all, <i>dukkha</i> —that everyone suffers and suffering is part of the world. But forgetting this is easy when you&#39;re told that you have a specific mental condition, and when you feel isolated and alone in your pain.<br><br> You are <i>not</i> defective simply for feeling distress.<br><br> <b>2. The goal is not to eradicate suffering.</b><br> It is normal and healthy to want relief from your suffering, but futile and dangerous to try to eradicate all of your pain. Think of it this way: When you have a headache, you want a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/08/mental-emotional-pain-tylenol-acetaminophen-relief/671226/">Tylenol</a> to take the edge off, but not narcotics strong enough to numb you completely. Emotional self-management—through meditation or prayer, or with the help of therapy—is like Tylenol, so that you can regain a bit more comfort and control.<br><br> <b>3. Your happiness requires unhappiness.</b><br> The 20th-century self-improvement writer Norman Vincent Peale wrote a wildly best-selling book called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking-10-traits-for-maximum-results-norman-vincent-peale/9780743234801?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i></a> , in which he exhorted readers to start each day by reciting Psalm 118:24: “This is the day the Lord has made. We will rejoice and be glad in it.” As a young man, I sometimes did this and gave thanks for the positive, happy things in my life as I did so. Today, I realize this was too narrow a reading of that verse. The psalmist is not saying “Be grateful for the fun stuff” but rather “Be grateful for <i>all</i> of it.” That means both the fun parts I want and the hard parts I need, so that I stay alert, mourn loss, learn, and grow.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/05/dog-anxiety-meds-treatment-antidepressants/674050/">Read: Treat your anxious dog like an anxious person</a><br><br> Some days, giving thanks for the bad feelings is just too hard. But we can at least remember that they exist for a reason; they are normal, <i>we</i> are normal, and we&#39;re all right for feeling them.<br><br> Stress and sadness are <i>not</i> automatic evidence that you have a disorder. They are evidence that you are a living, breathing human being living in a complicated world.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 20 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>安娜摇钱树/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>去年连任竞选中发表巡回演讲之前，罗恩·德桑蒂斯喜欢播放一段视频蒙太奇，显示他在新闻发布会上对记者无端粗鲁。它既琐碎又粗鲁，却受到了佛罗里达州州长基地的热烈欢迎。去年秋天，在佛罗里达州墨尔本举行的德桑蒂斯集会上，我和一群当地记者一起从高架记者笔上观看了这段视频。德桑蒂斯的年轻志愿者向记者团表现出的一贯礼貌与这位候选人的浮夸行为之间存在着明显的脱节。<br><br>然而，昨晚，扣篮罗恩被和解罗恩短暂取代。他决定让美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 的杰克·塔珀 (Jake Tapper) 在南卡罗来纳州接受采访，这反映出他在共和党总统提名的角逐中落后于唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 有多远。但更重要的是，这次采访拒绝了佛罗里达州州长最珍视的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSW-fWPBDko">原则</a>之一：主流记者是敌人，应该受到毫不掩饰的蔑视。德桑蒂斯的问题在于，他的竞选基本理论被证明是错误的。他承诺将以特朗普的身份参选，并增加注意力，但他却以特朗普的身份参选，但没有开玩笑。结果丑陋得足以让共和党选民退缩。现在，佛罗里达州州长似乎姗姗来迟地决定，拯救他的竞选活动的唯一方法就是摆脱暴躁情绪。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/05/ron-desantis-florida-state-politics-gop/673489/">摘自 2023 年 5 月号：美国最奇怪、最痴迷自由的州是如何落入独裁州长之手的？</a><br><br>我想，德桑蒂斯在墨尔本播放了这段蒙太奇，因为他看到特朗普在集会上痛骂“假新闻媒体”，并在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://bookanalysis.com/1984/two-minutes-hate/">两分钟仇恨</a>会议上带领他的支持者，而他得出了一个完全错误的结论。尽管德桑蒂斯很聪明，但他显然没有意识到特朗普的日常行为只是作秀。一个行为。特朗普一生都在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/03/donald-trump-rolodex.html">打电话给记者</a>八卦。卸任后，他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://people.com/politics/trump-is-king-at-mar-a-lago-authors-interviewing-former-president/">欢迎多位作家</a>来到海湖庄园<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/trump-interview-a-first-historical-assessment/629454/">，为他们撰写的有关他的白宫的各种书籍倾诉心声</a>。特朗普并不讨厌媒体；他只是讨厌媒体。如果有什么的话，那就是他<em>太</em>喜欢了。这个男人曾经<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/donald-trump-maggie-haberman-mar-a-lago/671510/">指着记者玛吉·哈伯曼</a>说：“我喜欢和她在一起；我喜欢和她在一起。”她就像我的心理医生。”<br><br>相比之下，德桑蒂斯似乎真的很讨厌媒体，因为他们的侵入、关注和尴尬的问题。他有一个不幸的习惯，当收到他认为不值得的询问时，他会像仪表板上的洋娃娃一样摇头。他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B_38Qkh4JxA">是在正式宣布竞选总统之前访问日本时这样做的</a>，当时有人冒昧地问他是否正在竞选，而他显然正在竞选。这个动作产生了一种奇怪的效果，他的眼球似乎停留在同一个地方，而他的头部的其余部分则在眼球周围摆动。令人惊讶的是，他很恼怒或不舒服。请让我和这个人玩扑克。<br><br>不过，面对塔珀，德桑蒂斯控制住了自己的摇摆，取而代之的是表现得认真而迟钝。他对 2020 年总统选举是否被窃取以及前总统是否应该面临刑事指控犹豫不决，声称自己更愿意“专注于未来”。他承认，许多攻击“觉醒”的人甚至无法定义这个词。他回避了关于他是否会在全国范围内延长佛罗里达州新的六周堕胎限制的问题，广泛声称自己将成为一名“反堕胎总统”，并声称无论如何，民主党国会将试图“将堕胎国有化”直到出生那一刻”，甚至允许“产后堕胎”。 （塔珀当时没有对此提出质疑，但后来在竞选活动中澄清了其含义，称其指的是拒绝向任何在堕胎手术中幸存的胎儿提供医疗服务。） 州长唯一的失态是声称“证据就在其中”。当谈到他的竞选失败时，他想起了一个不友善的故事，他曾经用三个手指直接从浴缸里吃巧克力甜点，但<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2023/03/ron-desantis-chocolate-pudding-denial">被候选人否认了</a>。<br><br>我们先不要像美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 评论员巴卡里·塞勒斯 (Bakari Sellers) 那样，他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/SKMorefield/status/1681409662283857923?s=20">声称</a>在采访中，德桑蒂斯“开始给人一种他可以成为美国总统的感觉”。但这是佛罗里达州州长的一个版本，比福克斯新闻之前遇到过的任何一位记者都温和得多。这是因为他现在需要主流媒体将他视为对特朗普的可信威胁：民意调查结果很<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-primary-r/2024/national/">糟糕</a>，氛围正在发生变化，而且他的竞选团队上周<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/15/desantis-campaign-sheds-staff-amid-cash-crunch-00106485?nname=florida-playbook&amp;nid=0000014f-1646-d88f-a1cf-5f46b4500000&amp;nrid=a9dbb1e3-7504-4eed-967a-d18e945378f7&amp;nlid=630310">解雇了</a>几名工作人员。除此之外，尽管德桑蒂斯从 5 月中旬到 6 月筹集了令人印象深刻的 2000 万美元，但他对豪赌客的依赖已经成为一个问题。 NBC 的一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/ron-desantis-campaign-finances-flashing-warning-signs-rcna94108">分析</a>发现，“德桑蒂斯超过三分之二的资金（近 1400 万美元）来​​自那些已达到法定上限且无法再次捐款的捐助者。”这些富有的支持者也比草根的真正信徒更有可能采取战略行动。他们没有兴趣支持失败者，因为他们钦佩他的原则。同样，以前支持默多克帝国的佛罗里达州州长的热情在最近几周<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/12/us/politics/desantis-fox-news-rupert-murdoch.html">明显降温</a>。<br><br>因此，德桑蒂斯冒险走出了福克斯新闻和怪异党派网站的温暖浅滩，进入了充满鲨鱼的记者海洋，这些记者实际上可能会问他一些棘手的问题，比如“谁赢得了 2020 年大选？”他需要证明自己不仅仅是落选者中最受欢迎的人，但整个竞选仍然围绕着前总统。 “德桑蒂斯团队拒绝看到这场比赛的本来面目，”《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/billscher/status/1680389742356045824?s=20"><em>华盛顿月刊</em></a>》的政治编辑比尔·谢尔最近在推特上写道。 “这场竞赛不在于谁拥有最好的税收计划。比赛的焦点是：特朗普，是或否。”就连美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 采访的播出也提供了这个问题的进一步证据：当晚，特朗普可能面临的第三次起诉将这一问题<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/07/18/desantis-campaign-cnn-appearance-00106921">推后了</a>。它还与密歇根州总检察长<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-66239857">指控 16 人</a>被指控虚假声称特朗普赢得 2020 年大选的消息相竞争。<br><br>德桑蒂斯要想康复，他必须克服四个因素——三个在他的控制范围内，一个在他的控制范围之外。首先是他对直接批评特朗普感到拘谨；如果你看起来很害怕，你就无法打败恶霸。第二个是他决定在几个重大文化问题上站在特朗普的右翼，包括新冠病毒政策、LBGTQ 权利和堕胎。这一策略可能会在大选中产生毒药，但在初选中甚至不会产生效果。第三，德桑蒂斯在外交和经济政策上仍然显得轻率；他短暂地淡化了俄罗斯入侵乌克兰的重要性，显然是为了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/tucker-carlson-desantis-russia_n_64b1d387e4b0dcb4cab32c83">讨好塔克·卡尔森</a>，然后又修改了自己的观点。他的书<em>《自由的勇气》</em>和他的竞选演讲都着重讨论了他的流行病政策和与迪士尼的斗争，尤其是很少讨论钱包问题。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/02/desantis-american-history-interpretation-constitution-originalism/673152/">阅读：被遗忘的罗恩·德桑蒂斯的书</a><br><br>诚然，特朗普在许多问题上都采取了极其不一致的立场，而且可能无法在地图上识别乌克兰。但这给我们带来了德桑蒂斯的第四个问题，他似乎无法控制的一个问题：他的个性<em>。</em>他并不是天生有趣、有趣或迷人的。正如他不理解特朗普表面上对媒体的仇恨所涉及的职业摔跤风格的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/Kayfabe">kayfabe</a>一样，他也不理解特朗普经常与偏执调情的行为会随着一个会心的眨眼而软化。<br><br>最近几天，德桑蒂斯团队<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/DeSantisWarRoom/status/1674899610379116546?s=20">分享了</a>一位名为“骄傲的大象”的 Twitter 用户制作的视频，该视频攻击特朗普在 2016 年的一次演讲中表示，他将“尽我所能保护我们的 LGBTQ 公民”。这段视频是赤裸裸的恐同，我的意思是，在批准引用有关德桑蒂斯通过“反跨性别”法案的头条新闻之间，男性腹肌明显起伏。作为回应，交通部长皮特·布蒂吉格<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2024-election/pete-buttigieg-mocks-ron-desantis-video-trying-prove-manhood-trump-rcna92235">指出</a>，“通过发布一段视频，将你的图像拼接在涂满油、赤裸上身的健美运动员之间，试图证明你的男子气概，这是很奇怪的。”布蒂吉格的丈夫查斯顿给出了更尖锐的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Chasten/status/1674974477522706432?s=20">结论</a>：“这实际上非常同性恋。”代表该党 LGBTQ 成员的团体 Log Cabin Republics 在推特上<a data-event-element="inline link"

”。除去特朗普的滑稽和卡通风格，剩下的就是公然的、明显令人厌恶的——甚至对共和党内部的许多人来说也是如此。<br><br>昨晚，德桑蒂斯告诉塔珀，无论是在他的第一场州长竞选中还是在与迪士尼的战斗中，他一直被注销。他指出了他已被证明的筹款能力。他不需要说，因为每个人都知道，到选举到来时，特朗普可能会陷入严重的法律危险。比赛仍然开放。但德桑蒂斯在接受采访时承认，他最大的问题并不在于建制媒体讨厌他——正如他经常声称的那样——而是他不愿直接面对特朗普，这让他很容易被忽视。<br><br></div>
