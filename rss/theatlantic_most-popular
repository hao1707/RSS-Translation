（我把自己算作这些人中的一员，因为我在过去的一年里<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/new-housing-affordability-crisis/674679/">致力于</a>在佛罗里达州寻找房子。）阳光地带城市的这种不可阻挡的吸引力取决于三个因素：这些地方往往拥有较便宜的住房，大量的住房工作和温暖的冬天。这些都不足以吸引大量人口，但它们结合起来似乎产生了一股不可抗拒的力量，像一场炽热的龙卷风一样吸走了心怀不满的北方人和加州人。<br><br><b>廉价住房</b><br><br>如今，你不必想知道另一半是如何生活的。你可以打开 Redfin，看看你能以低于纽约租金的价格在达拉斯买到多少房子。洛杉矶的房价中位数<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.redfin.com/city/11203/CA/Los-Angeles/housing-market">为 975,000 美元</a>。凤凰城郊区钱德勒的房价中位数<a

美元</a>。一旦你掌握了这些知识，就很难将其从你的脑海中驱逐出去。额外的五十万美元你会做什么？<br><br>每个阳光明媚、不断发展的城市都有一个共同点，那就是经济适用房。这就解释了为什么气候无可挑剔的洛杉矶<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/may/03/california-population-decline-states">正在失去居民</a>（包括<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/blog/linkedin-workforce-report-july-2023-los-angeles-ca">凤凰城</a>）。哈佛大学经济学家爱德华·格莱泽表示，“在菲尼克斯郊区或休斯顿郊区大规模建造住房比在加利福尼亚沿海或东北部的任何地方都要容易得多”。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/housing-in-the-u-s-is-too-expensive-too-cheap-and-just-right-it-depends-on-where-you-live/#2">东北部和西部</a>的城市往往<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13071/w13071.pdf">2007 年的一项研究</a>中，格莱泽发现，在 20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代，南方的住房供应量比该国其他地区增加了 20%。<br><br>事实上，许多人似乎最终选择了南方，因为他们的目标是加州的完美气候，但很快意识到他们负担不起，并定居在一个同样温暖、更便宜的地方，比如菲尼克斯或奥斯汀。只要问问<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-texas-town-52386513">埃隆·马斯克</a>就知道了。<br><br> <b>“营商友好”环境</b><br><br>并非所有热门、经济实惠的地方都是一样的。奥斯汀成为了一个因流行病而繁荣的城镇，但同样温暖、甚至更便宜的德克萨斯州西部城市米德兰却没有。这就是经济增长、人力资本和某种不可说的雅皮士的复杂组合。<i> </i>参加进来。<br><br>飙升的阳光地带城市大多位于税收较低的州，这有助于吸引企业。但许多国家也拥有著名大学，培养受过高等教育的人才。他们成功地创造了许多类似类型公司紧密相连的“集聚经济”。奥斯汀拥有德克萨斯大学、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-expands-in-austin/">苹果公司校园</a>，以及大批逃离高房价的向上流动的加州人和纽约人。米德兰，嗯，没有。<br><br>早在 20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代，奥斯汀就开始了吸引科技人才的战略，当时德克萨斯大学商学院院长<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://medium.com/texas-mccombs-news/the-kozmetsky-effect-91ef67c4cdf">乔治·科兹梅茨基 (George Kozmetsky</a> ) 在该地区招募了计算机公司，并推出了孵化器来培养当地人才（他的一名学员是德克萨斯大学的学生）命名为迈克尔·戴尔）。公司往往聚集在其他类似的公司附近——这种现象解释了加利福尼亚州的硅谷、剑桥的肯德尔广场和北卡罗来纳州的三角研究园。知识型员工喜欢靠近那些能为他们提供指导和工作线索的人。你可能不想永远留在自己的工作岗位上，所以跳槽到其他公司是件好事。企业和受过教育的工人往往会相互吸引，并吸引更多的企业，形成良性循环。在大流行的第一年，

“当人们到来时，他们反过来会改变这个地方，”布什研究所-新加坡管理大学经济增长计划主任卡勒姆·克拉克说。 “地方变大了；它变得更加富有；它变得更加国际化。”外籍加州人往往喜欢这一点。<br><br><b>温暖的冬天</b><br><br>山谷国家银行(Valley National Bank)主席、凤凰城的本世纪中叶<a data-event-element="inline link"

2018 年调查数据显示，人们搬到佛罗里达的首要原因是离家人更近（37%）、开始新工作（22%） ，<i>然后</i>是气候或天气（14%）。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/168770/half-illinois-connecticut-move-elsewhere.aspx#1">2014 年盖洛普民意调查</a>发现，天气是那些寻求离开伊利诺伊州、马里兰州和爱达荷州的人的一个主要原因，但这并不是任何州搬家者的<i>首要</i>原因。 <a data-event-element="inline

href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/02/04/as-the-pandemic-persisted-financial-pressures-became-a-bigger-factor-in-why-americans-decided-to-move/#:~:text=In%20November%2C%20a%20third%20of,other%20financial%20reasons%20in%20June.">在大流行期间</a>搬家的人可能会将经济原因或新冠病毒风险作为他们的动机。<br><br>尽管如此，忽视阳光地带的<i>太阳</i>还是很奇怪的。这是我采访过的所有专家最终都承认的一点——在太阳带上升背后的数据中很难找到天气因素，但也很难解释清楚。 Glaeser 表示：“没有任何变量比 1 月份的气温更能预测过去 120 年大都市区的增长。” “每个人都喜欢在冬天打高尔夫球，”加州大学伯克利分校的经济学家恩里科·莫雷蒂说。 “人们真的不喜欢寒冷的冬天，”布鲁金斯学会高级研究员珍妮·舒茨说。人们可能并不总是承认这一点，但他们似乎喜欢温暖的天气。<br><br>温暖的冬天似乎促进了廉价住房和充足的就业机会。人们会模糊地考虑一个有很多新企业和价值 30 万美元房屋的地方，但一旦他们看到数百条 Instagram 帖子，二月的天气是 70 度，他们就会给搬家公司打电话。 “我认为这是口耳相传。这是Instagram。多伦多大学教授（兼 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/richard-florida/"><i>《大西洋</i>月刊》撰稿人</a>）理查德·佛罗里达 (Richard Florida) 表示：“一个地方很热闹。” “‘我的朋友们都在那里。好有趣。他们去餐馆；他们要去海滩；冬天看起来并不冷。”如果你可以远程工作，为什么不呢？<br><br>吸引工人到气候温暖的州的商会、房地产经纪人和行业往往会强调“冬天的高尔夫”元素，淡化“熔岩炎热的七月”。纽约大学教授安德鲁·罗斯（Andrew Ross）撰写了多本有关阳光地带城市的书籍，他表示，“一月、二月和三月是人们被阳光地带吸引的三个原因”。 “房地产开发商、房地产经纪人，他们不谈论夏天。他们谈论一月、二月和三月。”<br><br><b>太阳带的转折点？</b><br><br>也就是说，如果他们的城市继续供暖并且也超出了负担能力的范围，那么所有这些新的亚利桑那州人和德克萨斯人可能会离开。例如，已经有大批人离开<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/miami-sees-its-first-population-drop-in-decades-e181171f">迈阿密</a>。一些阳光地带州的保守派州长可能不会吸引那些被城市吸引的富有创造力的自由派人士。 “假设你是一名搬到迈阿密的同性恋设计师。现在你抬头就会看到罗恩·德桑蒂斯，”理查德·佛罗里达说。 “然后你就说，<i>我他妈在这里做什么？</i> ”<br><br><a href="http://v/">阅读：南方的夏天变得难以忍受</a><br><br>佛罗里达州认为，出于气候和负担能力的原因，下一次大迁徙将是北方。麦迪逊或匹兹堡等中西部城镇可以在没有炎热夏季的情况下提供良好的设施，准备提供阳光地带的替代方案。中西部地区目前拥有<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wispolicyforum.org/research/worker-incentives-gaining-popularity-in-midwest-but-still-rare-in-wisconsin/">最多的</a>工人搬迁激励计划，该计划向远程工人支付报酬，让他们搬到人口稀少的城市。 （仅印第安纳州就有 16 个。）或者人们可能会迁移到温暖州的稍微凉爽的地区，选择弗拉格斯塔夫而不是凤凰城。 （在某种程度上，这<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/wp2023-17.pdf">已经发生了</a>。）<br><br>但就目前而言，气候学家的可怕预测似乎并没有让人们感到困惑。当然，德克萨斯人更希望天气凉爽，但炎热显然只是在可以忍受的范围内。菲尼克斯和达拉斯的许多居民在夏天的时候都在有空调的房屋、空调汽车和有空调的办公室之间轮换，以最大限度地减少三位数高温的影响。 “人们越来越多地迁往气候风险地区，而远离风险较低的地区，这一事实表明，要么气候风险不是推动这一趋势的主要因素，要么是住房成本等其他因素正在影响这一趋势。不仅仅是气候风险，”舒茨说。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.redfin.com/news/redfin-users-interact-with-flood-risk-data/">Redfin 的一项研究</a>表明，对洪水风险的了解可以促使人们购买风险较低的房屋，但目前尚不清楚这是否适用于更广泛的气候风险，例如高温。如果一个县 100% 的地区都有高热风险，那么“更安全”的房子是什么？<br><br>将搬到阳光地带的人们视为非理性或无知是不公平的。我们都希望在一个足够温暖的城市拥有一套便宜的房子和一份好工作。但生活总是需要妥协。加州没有足够的房子。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/04/13/unemployment-rate-us-cities">克利夫兰</a>没有足够的工作机会。有时，您能负担得起的最好的是凤凰城。 “我们不能告诉他们不要搬到那里，”舒茨说，“除非我们让他们能够生活在风险较低的其他地方。”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15

href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110848362917019858">“第一修正案权利”。</a>他的律师约翰·劳罗（John Lauro）疯狂地试图将他的当事人定位为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2023/08/02/trump-indictment-lawyer-00109360">“言论自由和政治倡导”的英雄，</a>认为特朗普<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/trump-investigations/2023/8/9/23826263/trump-2020-election-charges-legal-defense">“完全有权主张他在总统选举中的立场”</a> 。<br><br>许多备受瞩目的共和党人和保守派也围绕第一修正案联合起来，作为攻击起诉书的主要途径。众议院共和党第四号议员埃莉斯·斯特凡尼克 (Elise Stefanik) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-coup-plot-free-speech-lawyers-1234799345/">声称</a>，“根据第一修正案，特朗普总统完全有权正确地提出对 2020 年选举公正性的担忧”，几位著名的参议院共和党人也发表了类似声明。保守派杂志<i>《国家评论》</i>指责史密斯试图<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalreview.com/2023/08/this-trump-indictment-shouldnt-stand/?utm_source=recirc-desktop&amp;utm_medium=homepage&amp;utm_campaign=hero&amp;utm_content=related&amp;utm_term=first">“将受保护的政治言论定为犯罪”。</a>法学教授兼法律评论员乔纳森·特利（Jonathan Turley）预测，起诉书将遇到<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/4137650-even-lies-are-protected-speech-new-trump-indictment-bulldozes-the-first-amendment/">“将政治谎言定为犯罪的宪法问题”。</a><br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indictment-gop-trial/674813/">彼得·韦纳：对唐纳德·特朗普及其支持者的起诉</a><br><br>甚至特朗普的一些更严厉的批评者也接受了他的第一修正案论点。前众议员贾斯汀·阿马什英勇地反抗特朗普及其盟友（几乎肯定因此结束了自己的政治生涯），他反对起诉书，因为它<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/justinamash/status/1688253793417277440">“对待政客关于政治或宪法问题的错误信念，即使他们是显然是错误的，作为刑事犯罪。”</a>在媒体上，这个想法已经开始影响对案件的描述。例如， <i>《纽约时报》</i>称此案引发了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/02/us/politics/trump-indictment-lies-vs-free-speech.html'">“谎言与言论自由的冲突”。</a><br><br>但这整个框架都是错误的。对特朗普试图推翻 2020 年大选的起诉并不会威胁到第一修正案，哪怕是一点点。<br><br>第一修正案禁止政府“剥夺言论自由”。造成混淆的一个常见原因是，在为第一修正案的目的定义“<i>言论</i>”一词时，法律将其视为一个艺术术语，其法律含义比其日常含义既广泛又狭隘。例如，一些在普通对话中可能不被称为“言论”的活动<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://casetext.com/case/citizens-united-v-federal-election-comn">——进行企业政治捐款</a>、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-476_c185.pdf">设计婚礼网站</a>或 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://casetext.com/case/brown-v-entmt-merchants-assn">玩暴力视频游戏</a>——出于第一修正案保护的目的，被视为言论。与此同时，某些类别的言论长期以来被明确排除在第一修正案的保护之外。例如，政府可以惩罚<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://casetext.com/case/counterman-v-colorado-2">故意“真正威胁”身体暴力的</a>人。诽谤也不受第一修正案保护，尽管诽谤通常以文字形式（即口头言论）形式出现。<br><br>某些类别的言论不受宪法保护的原因是它们无助于实现<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://media.okstate.edu/faculty/jsenat/jb3163/theorists.html">第一修正案的目的</a>：促进一个个人可以学习和表达自己、发展和获得知识以及建立繁荣的民主制度的社会。阐明这些类别的精确轮廓是第一修正案的主要任务之一。<br><br>特朗普在 1 月 6 日的起诉书中被指控的罪名——妨碍司法罪、欺诈罪和共谋罪——完全属于一般意义上的言论范畴，不受第一修正案的保护。 （佐治亚州富尔顿县地方检察官法尼·威利斯对特朗普提出的敲诈勒索、教唆和共谋指控也是如此。）这不应该引起争议。毕竟，逃税者、篡改证人和金融诈骗者都是通过与他人交流来犯罪的，许多人就是因为这些言论而入狱的。许多暴力犯罪分子也通过言语来实施行为——想象一下黑帮老大下令进行袭击或一群银行抢劫犯计划下一次抢劫。这篇演讲没有进一步弘扬第一修正案的价值观，因此不值得宪法保护。<br><br>第一修正案确实对刑事起诉施加了一些重要的限制。正如<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23893877/show_temp-2.pdf">史密斯在起诉书开头所承认的那样</a>，特朗普享有第一修正案的权利，“公开谈论选举，并声称（即使是错误的）选举期间存在决定结果的欺诈行为，并且他获胜了。”因此，主要基于特朗普在“停止盗窃”集会上最具煽动性的谎言（可以说这些谎言有助于引发对国会大厦的袭击）的起诉将面临<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/12/january-6-committee-trump-criminal-charges-political-speech-first-amendment/672518/">真正的第一修正案障碍</a>。<br><br>但特朗普并未因与顾问辩论法律理论或公开散布谎言而受到指控。他被指控多次单独或与其他人一起试图通过协调“候补”（或虚假）总统选举人名单来欺骗政府，恐吓包括前副总统迈克·彭斯在内的公职人员，通过告诉州政府来干扰国会的核心职能抛出他们的选举结果，并最终阻止美国公众的选票得到公平计算。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/donald-trump-indictment-jack-smith/674855/">金伯利·韦勒（Kimberly Wehle）：特朗普的法律混乱越来越严重</a><br><br>起诉书确实指出了特朗普的公开言论及其造成的破坏，但它很小心地将它们与特朗普更广泛的犯罪行为联系起来，而不是让它们本身受到惩罚。例如，起诉书强调，特朗普在 1 月 6 日的“停止盗窃”演讲中，威胁性地敦促彭斯驱逐拜登选民，但这是在特朗普长达数月的幕后对彭斯施压的背景下进行的。 。<br><br>一些人批评起诉书对特朗普的所有行为（无论 2020 年选举是否被窃取）采取了立场，并得出特朗普实际上输了的结论，公平公正。但这种承认现实的意愿远非奥威尔式的试图将<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/opinion/criminal-justice/4137650-even-lies-are-protected-speech-new-trump-indictment-bulldozes-the-first-amendment/">“联邦政府设置为真理的仲裁者”，而</a>这恰恰是我们对政府的期望，无论是在刑事审判中还是在一般问题上。尽管<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/meet-the-press-70-years/wh-spokesman-gave-alternative-facts-inauguration-crowd-n710466">“另类事实”</a>的兜售者想让我们相信什么，但特朗普要么真的相信了，要么正如政府所辩称的那样，他并没有真诚地相信他的谎言和他推翻结果的运动。如果我们太害怕让政府在公开法庭上且排除合理怀疑地陈述事实，那么制定刑法就毫无意义了。<br><br>史密斯起诉特朗普仍面临诸多风险和不确定性。除了解决与适用的刑事法规相关的各种法律问题外，史密斯还必须确定特朗普的<a data-event-element="inline link"

class="smallcaps">在超过</span>四分之一个世纪的时间里，彭斯一直是一位尽职尽责、坚定的保守派。他开始在谈话电台工作，他的品牌是“脱咖啡因的拉什·林堡”。在他的第三次尝试中，他成功当选为众议院议员，他很高兴地在乔治·W·布什的两项重大立法成就——“不让一个孩子掉队”和扩大医疗保险——上反对共和党，以对抗共和党——彭斯都是在这两项成就上取得成功的。相信违反了他对某些小政府保守原则的承诺。但共和党人原谅了这些异端邪说。彭斯在众议院共和党领导层中升至第三位。<br><br>彭斯从众议院跃升至印第安纳州州长官邸，最后作为特朗普的竞选搭档获得了总统门票。你知道那是怎么回事：四年来，彭斯为特朗普的言行辩护。在幕后，他试图成为房间里的成年人。在国家电视台上，一只苍蝇停在他脸上。呀呀呀呀呀，然后政变来了。<br><br>此时，特朗普指示数千名支持者“强力”向美国国会大厦游行，阻止彭斯履行宪法规定的统计和核证选举人票的义务——这将使拜登正式成为当选总统。因此，一群最近投票选举彭斯为副总统的非常优秀的人走上宪法大道，架起绞刑架，冲进国会大厦。在这些活动过程中，许多人高呼“绞死迈克·彭斯”。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">就彭斯而言，</span>他对这种不愉快的情况持乐观态度。上个月，当被问及特朗普的最新威胁时——如果他被判有罪，美国将“非常危险”——他否认了这种可能性。彭斯对美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 的达纳·巴什 (Dana Bash) <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2023/07/23/mike-pence-reacts-to-donald-trump-very-dangerous-sot-bash-sotu-vpx.cnn">表示</a>：“我们运动中的每个人都是热爱这个国家的美国人，都是爱国人士或奉行法律与秩序的人，他们永远不会在那里或其他任何地方做出这样的事情。”<br><br> Bash 的发言很简短。 “考虑到 1 月 6 日他们想绞死你，你竟然不关心这件事，这真是太了不起了，”她说。<br><br>彭斯回应道：“这场运动中的人们，那些在 2016 年和 2020 年团结起来支持我们事业的人们，是这个国家最敬畏上帝、最守法、最爱国的人民，我……不会容忍这种行为。”概括性的，因为它们没有事实依据。”<br><br>在美国政治中，从来没有哪个候选人如此尽职尽责地遵循耶稣的指示：“谁打你的脸，连另一个打你的脸。”因此，无论你对迈克·彭斯有什么想说的，我敢打赌，如果一群 MAGA Proud Boys 想要他的束腰外衣，他也会向他们提供他的斗篷。上帝保佑他。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">在其他方面，</span>彭斯让我想起《旧约》中的一位先知，他告诉以色列人他们不想听到的消息，但无论如何都坚持了下来，受到他试图拯救的人们的辱骂。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/01/gods-plan-for-mike-pence/546569/">2018 年 1 月/2

href="https://www.c-span.org/video/?529323-4/mike-pence-speaks-2023-family-leadership-summit">抨击</a>彭斯拒绝推翻 2020 年大选，并强硬支持对乌克兰的军事援助。彭斯勇敢地面对卡尔森，并坚持他的保守派信念。<br><br>因此，考虑到<a data-event-element="inline

href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/08/business/media/tucker-carlson-trump.html">在私下</a>谈论他如何“强烈”讨厌特朗普的电视节目主持人和特朗普自己的副总统之间的选择——后者在一代人的时间里尽职尽责地为政府中的保守派事业服务，除了推翻特朗普之外，他在<em>一切事情</em>上都支持特朗普。美国民主、福音派……为塔克欢呼，向彭斯发出嘘声。<br><br>请赐给我们巴拉巴。<br><br>美国<span class="smallcaps">其他</span>国家不太知道如何对待彭斯。他是一个复杂的人物。<br><br>一方面，他容忍并捍卫了特朗普时代的所有掠夺行为。 2016年，他在福音派选民中为特朗普担保，巩固了特朗普对该党的掌控。在弗吉尼亚州夏洛茨维尔之后，他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/16/mike-pence-supports-trump-charlottesville-241708">支持</a>特朗普。在第一次弹劾期间，他是特朗普的支柱。他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/good-cop-bad-cop-trump-pence-dynamic-coronavirus/story?id=70043623">试图</a>清理特朗普对新冠疫情处理不当的最糟糕部分，同时煞费苦心地赞扬特朗普所做的英勇工作。他是2020年忠实的竞选搭档，这一切都是他睁着眼睛做的。<br><br>另一方面，在特朗普试图阻挠权力和平过渡的时刻，彭斯是唯一站在宪法与崩溃之间的人。在经历了一段时间的懦弱之后，他在最重要的时刻表现出了勇气。如果他在 1 月 6 日没有遵守法律，不知道会发生什么。<br><br>一些人认为，彭斯不应仅仅因为<em>没有违法而</em>获得赞扬。我同情。今天早上我没有抢劫银行——我能得到一块饼干吗？但最终，我发现彭斯在履行职责时表现出的英雄气概令人无法忽视。 1 月 6 日，他面临身体和职业风险；他的事业、他的生活以及他的家人的生命都受到了威胁。他冒着一切风险去遵守法律。很高兴想到我们都会做同样的事情，但我不确定。我<em>确信</em>彭斯的绝大多数共和党同僚不会这么做。<br><br>此外，彭斯是仅有的三名一直直言不讳地谈论 1 月 6 日和法治的共和党总统候选人之一，他并没有将自己对特朗普的批评表述为仅仅是“不利于共和党获胜的机会”。彭斯具备民主运动所希望的共和党人的大部分特质。在某些方面，他是<em>小</em>民主意义上的一个例子，说明了一个旨在恢复健康和自由主义的共和党应该是什么样子。<br><br>也正是因为如此，彭斯才被那么多共和党人谩骂，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3872">好感度勉强持平</a>。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">事实证明</span>，彭斯也不太知道自己该怎么办。因此，他正在尝试成为那些想绞死他的选民的化身。<br><br>这是最该死的事情。彭斯克服了一生的政治部落主义，与他的团队决裂。现在他正试图报复——因为他看不到他帮助他们变成了什么样子。<br><br>我最喜欢的理论之一是，在特朗普执政期间，我们发现我们的政治光谱有两个轴。我们都熟悉左-右、进步-保守的 x 轴。但也有一个从上到下、自由主义到非自由主义的 Y 轴。这种情况在美国已经存在了很长一段时间——实际上是自建国以来——但随着种族隔离制度的结束，我们很多人都忘记了这条 y 轴的存在。我们假设 x 轴右侧的保守派——里根家族、布什家族、多尔家族、麦凯恩家族、罗姆尼家族——也都位于 y 轴的顶部（自由主义一端） 。因为他们是。<br><br>但随着特朗普的出现，一些人——包括选民和民选官员——开始沿着 Y 轴向下飘向非自由主义一边。<br><br>彭斯很乐意配合，直到筹码落下，此时他选择了自由主义和民主。为此，美国欠他一笔永远无法偿还的债。<br><br>彭斯的悲剧在于，尽管他在 x 轴上持有保守主义政策观点，但他对 y 轴上的自由主义的坚定信念现在对他要求投票给他的保守派来说最重要。<br><br>自由社会可以对税率、基础设施支出和外交政策产生争论。在一个不自由的社会中，这些问题都不重要——唯一重要的是谁掌握权力。 “谁，谁？”正如列宁主义者过去所说的那样。<br><br>在民主、宪法、法治等重大问题上，迈克·彭斯现在在 Y 轴上与乔·拜登的距离比与共和党选民的距离要近得多。<br><br>他要么看不到，要么不会。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

运动大会迅速而残酷地被摧毁。在几个小时内，五所成员大学出发参加竞争对手的会议，提供由电视体育合同资助的巨额发薪日。正如杰梅勒·希尔（Jemele Hill）在<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/college-football-greed-conference-alignment/674930/">所说的那样</a>，这种转变“使学校和会议的长期利益与他们自己永不满足的贪婪发生了冲突”。<br><br>体育爱好者习惯于看到他们最喜欢的球队把钱放在球迷的愿望之上。这让人很容易忘记，这不是一个关于职业体育特许经营权的故事，或者实际上，任何类型的私人实体的故事。所有五所叛逃学校都是公立大学：华盛顿州、俄勒冈州、犹他州、亚利桑那州和亚利桑那州立大学。大学橄榄球赛的抢钱行为只是美国公立高等教育面临的令人不安的压力的一个症状。事实证明，我们的许多公立大学的行为根本不像公共机构。<br><br>人们很自然地认为公立高等教育机构比私立高等教育机构更加平等。在 K-12 中，公立学校免费，而私立学校则昂贵。但在大学层面，公民目的和私人利润之间的界限并没有那么清晰地映射到公共/私人鸿沟上。 The clearest evidence to date comes from a recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">blockbuster study</a> by a trio of economists at Harvard&#39;s Opportunity Insights project. Most media coverage has focused on the study&#39;s analysis of the so-called Ivy Plus schools, where the researchers found that the wealthiest students get an admissions bump relative to other applicants with the same academic profile. Even among people with identical SAT scores, students from the top 0.1 percent of income are more than twice as likely to get into universities like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Public flagships such as UC Berkeley and the University of Virginia showed no such bias.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/public-universities-debt/619546/">Josh Mitchell: A crimson tide of debt</a><br><br> But the researchers didn&#39;t just study the tiny clique of elite universities that dominates the public discourse. Their sample included 139 institutions, including 50 public universities, and the results show a more complicated picture. Not all private schools are biased in favor of the rich—and some of the schools that cater most egregiously to the wealthy turn out to be public.<br><br> Like many aspects of life in our large, divided nation, the character of your local university depends a lot on where you happen to live. Big blue states such as New York and California have extensive, highly regarded university systems with no wealth bias in admissions. If anything, they have the opposite. The ultra-wealthy are almost 50 percent <i>less</i> likely to attend Berkeley than similarly qualified not-rich students. The trend applies throughout the University of California system, as well as campuses in the State University of New York. Although public-university budgets nationwide were devastated by the Great Recession, California and New York eventually <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://shef.sheeo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SHEEO_SHEF_FY22_Report.pdf">restored</a> the lost funding and invested even more. That gives them the resources to keep tuition low and creates fewer incentives to chase wealthy applicants. The sheer size of those systems also means that power and money aren&#39;t concentrated in a single flagship university with aspirations of athletic greatness. SUNY at Stony Brook and UC Santa Barbara are both top-flight research universities, but nobody is paying big money for the broadcast rights to Stony Brook Seawolves or UCSB Gauchos football games; the latter team doesn&#39;t even exist. There&#39;s no deep-seated culture of rich athletic boosters, legacy admissions, and regional aristocracy surrounding these campuses.<br><br> The story is different in other states, especially in the South. Statistically, public universities such as Auburn University, the University of Mississippi, the University of Arkansas, and the University of Alabama look a lot like the Ivy Pluses in their approach to wealth and admissions. These schools are not highly selective—most people who apply are admitted—so the mechanism for exclusion works differently than at Princeton or Yale. To measure it, the Opportunity Insights researchers looked not just at admit rates but at whether applicants were likely to apply and attend, an approach that captures the whole process of marketing, recruitment, admissions, pricing, and enrollment. Their findings suggest that a college need not be ultra-elite to perpetuate class divides. Some public universities in the South serve the same function as private colleges and universities in the Northeast: destinations for the children of political leaders and wealthy businessmen, and a mechanism for transmitting that status to the next generation. Although Alabama has one of the highest poverty rates in America, only 11 percent of Auburn students qualify for a federal Pell grant. More than <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/healthstats/assets/83t2019.pdf">30 percent</a> of college-age Alabama residents are Black, yet Black students make up <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://auburn.edu/administration/ir/factbook/enrollment-demographics/historical-summaries/enrollment-gender-ethnicity.html">less than 5 percent</a> of Auburn&#39;s student body.<br><br> So if you&#39;re wondering how public-university students in the South can afford <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/sorority-consultants-rush-colleges-parents-prepare-80b2cfc8">$4,000 sorority-rush consultants</a> , as <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> recently reported, it&#39;s because their parents have money. If you&#39;re curious about why so many rich kids are on campus, it&#39;s because places like the University of Alabama give an effective 45 percent bump to the children of the top 1 percent. And if you want to know why few very low-income Black students attend these universities, it&#39;s because the schools were originally built to sustain a racist power structure that kept Black people in poverty, and those legacies have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/opinion/auburn-university-black-students.html">not yet</a> been overcome.<br><br> Representatives from the universities of Arkansas and Alabama both told me that they work hard to recruit and provide financial aid to low-income students in their respective states, which is true. Both say that income is not one of the official criteria that their admissions officers consider. But it doesn&#39;t have to be, because a very efficient unofficial filter is at play. Most of the students attending schools like the universities of Arkansas and Alabama come from other places, meaning they pay out-of-state tuition. At Alabama, where 58 percent of undergrads come from elsewhere, that amounts to $32,400 a year, plus room and board. Students who can afford such a high sticker price are wealthy almost by definition, and they are vital to public-university finances. The University of Michigan <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://admissions.umich.edu/costs-aid/costs">charges</a> out-of-state students more than $55,000, the same price as Harvard. Administrators are essentially running two institutions in parallel: a reasonably affordable public university for the residents of Michigan (in-state tuition: $16,736), and a very expensive private university for everyone else.<br><br> This dual identity shows up in the Harvard-study results. The richest and poorest students from Michigan get into Michigan at similar rates, controlling for test scores. For out-of-state students, however, there&#39;s a marked lean toward the rich. Again, this works differently than it does at elite private universities. In the Ivy Plus schools, the pro-wealth bias is accomplished with a witches&#39; brew of legacy preferences, admissions bumps for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/college-sports-benefits-white-students/573688/">patrician sports</a> such as squash and sailing, and outright <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-story-behind-jared-kushners-curious-acceptance-into-harvard">pay-to-play arrangements</a> for mega-donors. At public universities, it&#39;s a more straightforward downstream effect of pricing. Most out-of-state students get little or no financial aid, so only the rich can afford to enroll.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Universities defend these policies</span> by arguing that wealthy students subsidize their poorer classmates, who don&#39;t pay full price. But as the sociologists Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton describe in their groundbreaking 2015 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/paying-for-the-party-how-college-maintains-inequality-elizabeth-a-armstrong/9780674088023?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Paying for the Party</i></a> <i>,</i> the two-tier approach works out badly for first-generation and low-income students. Following two groups of undergraduates at Indiana University, they found that the wealthy out-of-staters sailed through four years of fraternity parties and weekend tailgates to graduate, marry, and start careers, while the first-gen students ended up with burdensome student loans, uncertain job prospects, and no degrees.<br><br> For some low-income students, the dream of attending a flagship public university turns sour. At Alabama, there&#39;s an 18-percentage-point <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=university+of+alabama&amp;s=all&amp;id=100751#outcome">gap</a> between the graduation rate of Pell-grant students and their more well-off peers, an unusually large disparity. Despite all of those out-of-state dollars, families earning less than $75,000 still pay <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=university+of+alabama&amp;s=all&amp;id=100751#expenses">about</a> $20,000 a year in total costs to attend. Auburn&#39;s numbers are similarly grim. The more public universities come to resemble private ones, the more they cater to the people who pay the bills. Consider the three mega-conferences that now dominate the college-football landscape, the SEC, Big 10, and Big 12. Michigan State, University of Florida, Purdue, University of Kentucky, Texas A&amp;M: all big-time sports schools, all running the out-of-state full-tuition racket, all skewed toward the rich.<br><br> The gap between public universities that combat wealth inequality and those that seem to perpetuate it maps onto the red/blue divide, but only roughly. Higher education in America is also shaped by idiosyncrasies of history and geography. North Carolina, a purplish state, has a great, well-funded system of affordable public universities. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has no wealth preferences, nor does North Carolina State. (Duke University, right nearby, has that covered.) Pennsylvania, a fairly blue state, has an unusually lousy tradition of inadequate funding for public universities. Penn State charges non-Pennsylvanians $38,000 a year.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Annie Lowrey: Why you have to care about these 12 colleges</a><br><br> One kind of university seems immune to all of these trends: science-and-engineering schools. Based on my analysis of the data, only five private universities in the Harvard study were <i>less</i> likely to admit applicants from the top 0.1 percent than comparably qualified middle-class students. Four of them—California Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Worcester Polytechnic University, and Case Western Reserve University—have top-class engineering programs. Among the Ivy Pluses, MIT was the least corrupted by wealth preferences. Public universities such as the Georgia Institute of Technology, Virginia Tech, and the Colorado School of Mines also had more egalitarian results.<br><br> Even the most elite liberal-arts school can create an easy glide path to graduation for the dull-witted progeny of a deep-pocketed alum. Athletic recruits can famously go from start to finish at a big state school without encountering a single challenging idea along the way. Engineering schools, by contrast, have academic standards that are harder to evade. Martin Schmidt, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic, came to the job after serving as provost at MIT. “There&#39;s a phrase we used there,” he told me, about the rigorous math and science classes all students are required to take. “&#39;There&#39;s nowhere to hide.&#39;”<br><br> Of course, not every university can or should be devoted to math and science. But the existence of these respected engineering institutions—public and private, humble and world-renowned—shows that there&#39;s nothing inevitable about higher-education systems that bend toward the gravity of wealth. If academic standards come first, the power of money recedes. Otherwise, colleges and universities become just one more thing to be bought and sold.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/public-university-wealthy-admissions/675009/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/public-university-wealthy-admissions/675009/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Abortion-Housing Nexus]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> People want to live in states with access to abortion care.

And they are among the two <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/27/us/transgender-laws-states.html">dozen states</a> that have implemented statutes affecting trans people: banning gender-affirming care, requiring trans youth to be identified by the gender they were assigned at birth, restricting trans kids&#39; participation in sports, or barring teachers from discussing what it means to be gay or trans.<br><br> Yet such states remain a draw for families from blue, coastal areas. “There&#39;s this trade-off between living somewhere that you can afford and where you have access to jobs,” Daryl Fairweather, the chief economist of Redfin, told me, versus living “where the laws are the way that you want them to be.”<br><br> In the survey, not everyone professed a policy preference, but roughly a third of Texans and Floridians who had recently moved or were likely to move said that they would like to live somewhere with legal gender-affirming care for kids. That is eight to 16 percentage points higher than the share who said they do <em>not</em> want to live somewhere where such gender-affirming care is legal. About 40 percent of respondents in those states said they would like to live somewhere with legal abortion access, twice as many as said they would prefer to live somewhere without it.<br><br> But folks were still much more likely to say that financial considerations played a primary role in where they had settled or would settle down. The cost of living, access to jobs, the size of available homes, and proximity to family were more commonly cited factors.<br><br> Over the past two decades, the country&#39;s growing housing shortage has prevented Americans from moving <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/harvard_jchs_are_americans_stuck_in_place_frost_2020.pdf">as often as they used to</a> , and as often as would make sense given the country&#39;s wage trends. Jobs pay much more in Boston and Oakland than they do in small towns in Alabama or exurbs in Utah, a differential that has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/blog/2023/06/geographic-inequality-rise-us">grown over time</a> . But housing costs in those places rose so much <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w12355/w12355.pdf">due to supply restrictions</a> that they became unaffordable and inaccessible for many would-be residents.<br><br> People who are moving tend to be moving to cheaper places. Differences in housing affordability have pulled Americans to the Sunbelt and the Mountain West, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.freddiemac.com/research/insight/20220622-pursuit-affordable-housing-migration-homebuyers-within">pushed</a> them from expensive megalopolises to smaller cities, suburbs, and exurbs. Redfin&#39;s data, for instance, show that the average home in Miami is selling for $515,000 versus $705,000 in New York, the most common origin of out-of-state movers. Homes in Dallas are half the price of homes in Los Angeles.<br><br> “Even if people would want, in a perfect world, to move to a different place that didn&#39;t have whatever-it-might-be laws, they&#39;re kept in place by these bigger, more salient forces for them,” Riordan Frost, a senior research analyst at Harvard&#39;s Joint Center for Housing Studies, told me. (Frost did not work on the Redfin project.) “Even though there are abortion restrictions, people move because of affordability. Even though there are wildfires and more <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.freddiemac.com/research/insight/20221109-migration-environmentally-risky-areas-consequence">natural disasters in a place</a> , people move because of affordability.”<br><br> Those migration trends have increased red states&#39; political influence. Texas and Florida alone have added more than 15 million <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/03/texas-population-passes-the-30-million-mark-in-2022.html#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202022%2C%20the%20state%20gained%209%2C085%2C073%20residents%2C%20more,Nevada%2C%20Utah%2C%20and%20Idaho.">residents</a> over <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2023/03/texas-population-passes-the-30-million-mark-in-2022.html#:~:text=From%202000%20to%202022%2C%20the%20state%20gained%209%2C085%2C073%20residents%2C%20more,Nevada%2C%20Utah%2C%20and%20Idaho.">the past two decades</a> , translating into a dozen additional congressional seats. Blue states, in contrast, have throttled their population growth. “It&#39;s a policy choice on both fronts: California has chosen to protect abortion rights, and they&#39;ve chosen to have policies that restrict housing,” Fairweather told me. “I don&#39;t even know if policy makers understand this yet. But California&#39;s housing policies have made the citizens of the United States have less access to those rights.”<br><br> In interviews, people personally affected by anti-LGBTQ laws described them as a strong motivator to leave the red states they call home. Jay Bates Domenech, a young trans person from suburban Utah, told me that the state&#39;s political climate had pushed them to spend roughly $10,000 more a semester to go to college out-of-state: Domenech is moving to Colorado this week.<br><br> Domenech told me that they had been harassed and bullied for their gender in high school. “A few months ago, a kid followed me down the hallway calling me a pedophile. He took out his phone to take a picture of me,” they told me. “From the moment I came out, there was an underlying anxiety that something was going to happen to me.” Concerns about their physical safety and ability to access health care pushed them to move, they said, adding that they felt targeted by the state&#39;s anti-LGBTQ politicians. “The increase in suicide rates and mental-health diagnoses—it&#39;s something I am seeing at a personal, individual level,” they told me.<br><br> But many other queer and trans people don&#39;t have the money or flexibility to uproot their lives. Anthony, who asked me to withhold his last name to avoid any threats to his family, moved from Maryland to Florida five years ago, purchasing a fixer-upper for $220,000. “I&#39;m scared about what the Florida legislature is going to do,” he told me. He and his husband would like to move back to the DC area. But high interest rates and the higher cost of living would make it unaffordable to do so.<br><br> Redfin&#39;s finding that people would prefer to live in places with legal access to abortion mirrors that of many <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/abortion-poll-roe-dobbs-ban-opinion-fcfdfc5a799ac3be617d99999e92eabe">other polls</a> . States barring or tightening access to abortion have seen an 11 or 12 percentage-point increase in the share of people who say the medical procedure should be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/04/26/nearly-a-year-after-roes-demise-americans-views-of-abortion-access-increasingly-vary-by-where-they-live/">easier to obtain</a> .<br><br> In the long term, the loss of abortion access is expected to intensify the country&#39;s already intense geographic inequality. The hundreds of thousands of people forced to continue unwanted pregnancies will end up sicker and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/abortion-turnaway-study-roe-supreme-court/661246/">poorer for it</a> : Not being able to terminate a pregnancy makes a person more likely to become impoverished, unemployed, in debt, and subject to eviction, and an abortion is safer than carrying a pregnancy to term. Many companies are avoiding adding employees or doing business in states with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/08/companies-paying-for-abortion-travel-expenses/671174/">strict bans</a> .<br><br> Yet the Redfin data suggest that relatively few people will move because of changing health-care statutes. Abortion access is already heavily predicated on a person&#39;s physical location and socioeconomic status: Wealthy Texans fly to Illinois for abortions; poor Tennessee residents find themselves stuck. “There are states that were destinations for people seeking abortions where clinics have closed post-Dobbs, forming abortion deserts, particularly in the southeastern and central United States,” Betsy Pleasants, a researcher at UC Berkeley&#39;s Wallace Center for Maternal, Child and Adolescent Health, told me. Those deserts are simply too formidable and expensive for many people to cross.<br><br> Sam Dickman is one person who did leave Texas as a result of the state&#39;s changing legal abortion landscape. He is a physician and an abortion provider. He and his partner moved to Montana so that he could continue to do his life&#39;s work.<br><br> “I see patients traveling in from Texas, Idaho, Wyoming, North Dakota, all these states surrounding Montana, to get abortion care,” he told me. “The median abortion patient is a young, low-income person of color. These are populations who are struggling to afford rent.” He added: “If I asked a patient, <em>Have you ever thought about moving to a place with better abortion access?</em> It would be item No. 15 on their radar. They would look at me like, <em>What are you talking about? I can&#39;t afford to have a kid right now. Obviously, I can&#39;t afford to move.</em> ”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/housing-survey-abortion-access-gender-affirming-care-state-policies/675017/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/housing-survey-abortion-access-gender-affirming-care-state-policies/675017/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Georgia Indictment Offers the Whole Picture]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Fani Willis filed charges against Donald Trump and 18 others, alleging a sweeping scheme to overturn the 2020 election. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ylCMLnbSHgvlha1yQZ43s_A_hbA=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/trump_georgia/original.jpg" alt="刘易斯·P·斯莱顿法院" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Elijah Nouvelage / AFP / Getty</figcaption></figure> If justice is blind, she sometimes heads down unpredictable paths. For example, only in Donald Trump&#39;s fourth felony indictment, unsealed last night in Atlanta, has a local prosecutor managed to deliver a sweeping, nationwide view of the former president&#39;s scheme to steal the 2020 election.<br><br> The indictment, obtained by Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis, accuses Trump and 18 others of a racketeering scheme, stretching across states and months, that sought to subvert the results of the election Trump lost. Some of the names are household ones, or have become so over the past three years: Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell, Mark Meadows. Others will be new to all but the most avid followers of the postelection machinations in Georgia.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">Earlier this month</a> , Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith charged Trump in connection with the postelection scheme, but Smith kept his indictment narrow, focusing on Trump himself and just a few of the fronts along which he tried to challenge the vote.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">David A. Graham: A brazen, dead-serious attack on American democracy</a><br><br> Willis takes a very different approach, with 41 counts against the 19 defendants. Crucially, the charges are brought under Georgia&#39;s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. That&#39;s a favorite of the prosecutor—“I&#39;m a fan of RICO,” she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/why-georgias-rico-law-could-be-key-in-the-states-case-against-trump">said in a news conference</a> about a gang-related case last year—and it allows her to charge a large number of people with a concerted effort toward a goal, even if not all members of the group committed all of the crimes involved.<br><br> The indictment charges that Trump, the 18 co-defendants, and 30 other unindicted co-conspirators “constituted a criminal organization whose members and associates engaged in various related criminal activities including, but not limited to, false statements and writings, impersonating a public officer, forgery, filing false documents, influencing witnesses, computer theft, computer trespass, computer invasion of privacy, conspiracy to defraud the state, acts involving theft, and perjury.”<br><br> This indictment is not a gripping read, stretching over 80-some pages and collecting 161 separate alleged overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. But in its comprehensive scope, it gives a fuller picture of Trump&#39;s attack on American democracy than any other indictment so far. In many ways, it echoes the report put together by the House committee on January 6 that completed its work earlier this year, just before Republicans took over the majority.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/criminal-justice-system-and-election-are-not-going-get-along/673971/">David A. Graham: The criminal-justice system and the election are not going to get along</a><br><br> The elements of the conspiracy include crimes specific to Georgia: a breach of voting machines in Coffee County; an attempt to intimidate Ruby Freeman, an election worker in Fulton County; lies told to Georgia officials and attempts to enlist them in the election subversion; the creation of false slates of electors to be submitted to the Electoral College.<br><br> But the indictment also sweeps up crimes committed by the defendants elsewhere, including similar efforts at the state level in Arizona and Pennsylvania, an attempt to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/jeffrey-clark-doj-weaponization-trump-indictment/674898/">leverage the Justice Department</a> to help justify subversion schemes, and a ploy to get then–Vice President Mike Pence to throw a wrench in the January 6, 2021, certification of the election.<br><br> It is remarkable, and a bit troubling, to see a local official like Willis—even one in a huge county like Fulton—bringing charges of this scope. On the one hand, common sense says that the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/trumps-coup-before-january-6/620998/">paperwork coup</a> , whether or not it was criminal, was clearly a connected whole and not a series of isolated actions, and so it makes sense to treat it as such in court. Smith&#39;s August indictment is an odd document, hitting some elements hard while ignoring others.<br><br> On the other hand, an attempt to undermine the presidential election on a national scale is clearly a matter larger than any county prosecutor&#39;s purview. A nation in which local district attorneys feel empowered to charge presidents, current or former, is a potentially chaotic one. (What&#39;s to stop conservative prosecutors in small counties from bringing flimsy charges against Joe Biden?)<br><br> Willis has the freedom to bring a much broader case in part <em>because</em> she is a local prosecutor. Though under Merrick Garland, the Justice Department has emphasized its distance from politics, Smith must know how politically incendiary and possibly unworkable an enormous federal RICO endorsement would be. Perhaps even more important, he knows that if Trump or another Republican wins the 2024 election, they will likely try to shut down any federal prosecution as soon as they take office—encouraging him to keep his case tightly focused and fast-moving. Willis, an elected official, doesn&#39;t have the same political constraints, and her case isn&#39;t subject to the whims of the federal executive branch.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/">David A. Graham: Trump is acting like he&#39;s cornered</a><br><br> But proving such a case will be difficult. RICO cases are famously complicated, unwieldy, and sometimes confounding to jurors, even in less politically charged situations. In a statement last night, Trump argued that his actions as charged under the indictment constitute free speech. “They are taking away President Trump&#39;s First Amendment right to free speech, and the right to challenge a rigged and stolen election that the Democrats do all the time,” he said.<br><br> Trump also complained that the charges have taken too long to bring. Without any evidence, he wrote that Willis had “strategically stalled her investigation to try and maximally interfere with the 2024 presidential race,” adding, “They could have brought this two and half years ago.” Though investigations take time, he&#39;s got a point. Still, underscoring that all Americans were aware of his subversion scheme at the time it was happening is not as exculpatory as Trump might like to pretend.<br><br> Whatever the reasons for the timeline, Willis has speed on her mind now. She said at a press conference after the indictments were released that she wanted to bring all 19 defendants to trial together within the next six months. That would put the case right in the heat of the Republican primary.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/criminal-justice-system-and-election-are-not-going-get-along/673971/">As I have written</a> , the criminal-justice and political systems are not just designed to not work well together; they are designed to be separate. This case is about Trump testing the strength of the American system of governance; trying it will be yet another chance for him to test it.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 04:30:11 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-georgia-indictment-election/675018/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-georgia-indictment-election/675018/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Sam Bankman-Fried Pushed One Boundary Too Many]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The FTX founder is showing a surprising amount of self-confidence for someone in the midst of a serious legal battle. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/TPEAsc-1oSzB_jEURLSYXQDSCVI=/0x0:3172x1784/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/GettyImages_1556766926/original.jpg" alt="萨姆·班克曼-弗里德" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Victor J.

Just add stuff to it.</a></li> <strong>&#39;Up to the Line&#39;</strong><br><br> Sam Bankman-Fried has long bent the rules. The FTX founder once <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/23304495/sequoia-sbf-profile.pdf">wowed</a> elite investors with talk of FTX&#39;s bright future while playing the video game <i>League of Legends</i> during a meeting; later, he raised a “meme round” of $420.69 million from 69 investors. For years, Bankman-Fried&#39;s maverick approach worked in his favor: His quirky persona, unruly mop of hair and all, endeared him to celebrity backers, placated regulators, and helped propel him to billionaire status by his late 20s.<br><br> This renegade attitude has not served Bankman-Fried quite as well lately. In December 2022, he was arrested in the Bahamas and charged with fraud and conspiracy to commit money laundering, among other crimes (he pleaded not guilty in January). On Friday, a judge revoked Bankman-Fried&#39;s bail ahead of his October trial, citing a pattern of boundary-pushing behaviors, including the alleged intimidation of witnesses while on house arrest at his parents&#39; Bay Area home. Bankman-Fried was sent to the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, a jail with notoriously <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/bankman-fried-heads-brooklyn-jail-notorious-poor-conditions-2023-08-14/">bleak conditions</a> . Lawyers for Bankman-Fried declined to comment; his team filed an appeal on Friday.<br><br> Facing consequences is new for Bankman-Fried: For years, he built up a crypto empire while <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/documents/ray-ftxreport-04092023.pdf">apparently betraying customer trust</a> with impunity. That&#39;s in part because he succeeded in charming Congress, which does not have a strong history of investigating “ask forgiveness, not permission” tech founders. The Silicon Valley establishment boosted him too, pouring money into his start-up and enabling him to install a board of directors that did not include <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/technology/ftx-investors-venture-capital.html">any investors</a> . It didn&#39;t hurt that Bankman-Fried&#39;s reputation as a pedigreed MIT whiz kid <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2022-11-10/sam-bankman-fried-sbf-was-seen-by-vcs-as-a-model-founder-at-ftx">matched investors&#39; vision</a> of what a successful tech founder looked like.<br><br> Bankman-Fried has spent his time under house arrest in ways that show a surprising amount of self-confidence for someone in the midst of a serious legal battle. Judge Lewis Kaplan of the Manhattan Federal District Court, who is presiding over Bankman-Fried&#39;s case, said on Friday that the defendant “has gone up to the line over and over again.” Since the start of his house arrest, Bankman-Fried has invited a crypto influencer to swing by, talked with the author Michael Lewis for a book, and used a VPN to log on to the internet. His at-home conduct has not pleased the prosecution, which had already gotten the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/judge-seeks-tougher-bail-restrictions-for-sam-bankman-fried-f4602e45">terms of his bail</a> tightened earlier this year, after he was accused of attempting to contact another former FTX executive and possible witness in the case. Then his unorthodox behavior seemed to go even further: <i>The New York Times</i> published an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/20/technology/ftx-caroline-ellison-bankman-fried.html">article</a> last month that included leaked diary entries from Caroline Ellison, the one-time head of Bankman-Fried&#39;s crypto hedge fund, as well as his ex-girlfriend. Though the article did not say where the entries came from, lawyers for the prosecution later said that Bankman-Fried was the source. Bankman-Fried&#39;s lawyers confirmed in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939/gov.uscourts.nysd.590939.178.0.pdf">court filing</a> that he had shared “certain documents,” but countered that he “did nothing wrong” in communicating with the Times on this matter. (Before I joined <i>The Atlantic</i> , I was part of the team of <i>New York Times</i> reporters covering the collapse of FTX, but I had no involvement with the recent article.)<br><br> In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940/gov.uscourts.nysd.590940.176.0.pdf">court documents</a> , prosecutors argued that leaking the diaries was an attempt to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/11/technology/sam-bankman-fried-jail.html">intimidate and discredit Ellison</a> —to make it appear that “Ellison was a jilted lover who perpetrated these crimes alone.” Ellison <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/12/22/ftxs-gary-wang-alamedas-caroline-ellison-plead-guilty-to-federal-charges-cooperating-with-prosecutors.html">pleaded guilty</a> to federal charges in December and is expected to be a key witness in Bankman-Fried&#39;s criminal trial this fall. After the judge instituted a temporary gag order, lawyers from the <i>Times</i> and other organizations opposed the order on First Amendment grounds. As of Friday, the status of the gag order was not clear.<br><br> Learning that Bankman-Fried had allegedly leaked the diaries in an attempt to discredit Ellison was surprising, because they made Ellison sound fairly sympathetic. In the months before the fund collapsed, Ellison expressed doubts about her abilities as a leader—and, yes, hurt about her breakup with Bankman-Fried. She said in a message to Bankman-Fried in November that she had felt dread about FTX&#39;s impending collapse, though she didn&#39;t appear to act on those feelings. I was also struck by the fact that Ellison&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ftx-debtors-file-schedules-and-statements-of-financial-affairs-with-bankruptcy-court-301773613.html?tc=eml_cleartime">compensation package</a> was much smaller than that of her male colleagues.<br><br> This case is a complex business and legal morass, but it&#39;s also likely to involve much interpersonal messiness. Several of FTX&#39;s leaders lived together in a penthouse in the Bahamas (including Ellison and Bankman-Fried). The colleagues, once friends, may now cooperate with the government against one another.<br><br> Before his downfall, Bankman-Fried cultivated an image as the responsible crypto leader in a Wild West industry. Now he joins the ranks of high-flying tech founders—including those who received fawning press coverage and massive funding—in the hot seat, accused of defrauding investors and conspiring to launder funds. For years, the tech industry <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/15/business/silicon-valley-fraud.html">rewarded</a> risk taking, “disruption,” and “breaking things.” But a litany of recent scandals has made the public—and investors in particular—more skeptical of those tenets. In the 2010s, when <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ft.com/content/1d2af214-caf6-4326-916d-b597577186c8">money was cheap</a> , venture capitalists taken in by charismatic leaders didn&#39;t ask many questions of the companies they were getting involved with. But higher interest rates have led to layoffs, finger-pointing, and a period of relative austerity in Silicon Valley; it is no longer the case that anything goes. Start-up funding has plummeted, and investors are looking more closely at companies&#39; claims. Tech bosses are being investigated and accused of misconduct in federal court: The Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes was convicted of defrauding investors and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/18/business/elizabeth-holmes-jail-restitution.html">ordered to report to prison</a> a few months ago, and Charlie Javice, who sold a student-loan assistance start-up to JP Morgan for millions, was accused this past spring of falsifying customer data.

I had arrived a few hours before check-in, hoping to drop off my bags before I met a friend for lunch. The employees were clearly frazzled, overwhelmed by the sudden influx of several hundred impatient academics. When I asked where I could put my luggage, the guy at the front desk simply pointed to a nearby hallway. “Wait over there with her; he&#39;s coming back.” ……</p><p> I saw the woman he was referring to. She was white and about my age. She had a conference badge and a large suitcase that she was rolling back and forth in obvious exasperation. “Been waiting long?” I asked, taking up a position on the other side of the narrow hallway. “ <i>Very</i> ,” she replied. For a while, we stood in silence, minding our phones. Eventually, we began chatting …</p><p> Then, out of nowhere, she said something that caught me completely off guard: “But I shouldn&#39;t be complaining to you about this.

Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, who claimed earlier this summer that they would engage in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/06/silicon-valley-elon-musk-zuckerberg-ceos/674550/">cage match</a> , have since been posting on their respective social-media platforms about the battle. Musk, after saying that he was recovering from a shoulder surgery, said last week on X that “everything in camera frame” during the fight “will be ancient Rome.” Soon after, Zuckerberg wrote on Threads: “Not holding my breath for Elon, but I&#39;ll share details on my next fight when I&#39;m ready.” I, like Zuckerberg, am not holding my breath—though I am following along with confusion as Musk tags Zuckerberg in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1691135091689611264?s=20">posts</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1691135486340063232">like</a> “Knock, knock … challenge accepted … open the door” and “Thought you might want some tea, so I brought the bags.”<br><br> — Lora<br><br> <i>Katherine Hu contributed to this newsletter.</i><br><br> <em>When you buy a book using a link in this newsletter, we receive a commission.

Sources: Bettmann / Getty; ALAIN JOCARD, ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS / AFP / Getty.</figcaption></figure> What follows is not news.<br><br> Earlier today, Elon Musk furthered the narrative that he wishes to engage in hand-to-hand combat with Mark Zuckerberg, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1691135091689611264?s=20">tweeting</a> in such a way as to suggest that he was at Zuckerberg&#39;s front door. (Previously, he called Zuckerberg a “chicken.”) By typing these words, I am complicit in what has been a months-long bit of posturing over the ridiculous premise that the pair will <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/musk-zuckerberg-cage-fight-social-media-supremacy/674503/">fight in a “cage match.”</a> If you&#39;re hearing this all for the first time, I apologize profoundly.<br><br> My general framework for navigating modern life is to try to imagine, and then make sure to never bet against, the dumbest possible outcome. Thanks to our tech billionaires, it&#39;s harder than ever to game out what that might mean. Would Musk and Zuckerberg sweatily groping each other among Etruscan ruins on pay-per-view constitute the dumbest possible outcome of this Silicon Valley promenade of fragile male egos? Surely, watching an off-balance Musk dislocate his pinky toe against the femur of the man who gave us the “Poke” button would constitute the teleological end point of the social-media age. You would think! But innovators <em>innovate</em> .<br><br> Anyhow, thanks to some screenshots shared by Musk, we know that the pair have been texting recently. “I don&#39;t want to keep hyping something that will never happen,” a seemingly frustrated Zuckerberg said to Musk. Musk, meanwhile, appeared oblivious and continued to egg Zuckerberg on. At one point, as the result of an inexplicable series of firing neurons, Musk managed to not only type but also send the following two-sentence tone poem: “I will be in Palo Alto on Monday. Let&#39;s fight in your Octagon.”<br><br> At a sentence level, these words, strung together in this order and seemingly without irony, are hilarious. From the standpoint of being a human, the Musk-Zuck cage match is an offensive waste of time—the result of a broken media system that allows those with influence and shamelessness to commandeer our collective attention at will. Musk and Zuckerberg have generated a pseudo event that bolsters their own relevance. Meanwhile, you and me? We&#39;re hostages trapped in Mark Zuckerberg&#39;s backyard octagon.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/musk-zuckerberg-cage-fight-social-media-supremacy/674503/">Read: The nerds are bullies now</a><br><br> Ostensibly, we are conditioned to pay attention to Zuckerberg and Musk because they have a lot of money and power. They employ tens of thousands of people, and the decisions they make with their platforms have profound implications for how we communicate. There&#39;s little doubt of their influence—just look at the way that Musk has managed to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/07/28/business/starlink.html">dominate the exosphere</a> with his satellite-internet company. Logically, it tracks that people are interested in what these men do with their spare time, how they conduct themselves in public and private life. The erratic actions of billionaires are newsworthy. Right?<br><br> It&#39;s not so simple. This episode shows the limitations of <em>newsworthiness</em> , which, as I&#39;ve <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/opinion/facebook-trump-iran.html">previously</a> written, is a choice masquerading as an inevitability. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/trump-twitter-account-special-counsel-search-warrant/674969/">Attention hijackers</a> learned ages ago that newsworthiness affords them an opportunity to stay in the spotlight, provided that they keep doing outrageous things. This tactic, which has become so common as to feel unremarkable, fundamentally breaks what is now an extremely outdated supposition by the media, which is that the people they cover are doing things for reasons <em>besides</em> simply attracting attention and engagement. Schrödinger&#39;s Cage Match is a sterling example of a pure attention spectacle. It&#39;s good PR for Zuckerberg, who is in the news for something other than fomenting geopolitical unrest through Facebook. For Musk, a man who pursues attention the way a black hole hoovers interstellar gas and dust, every mention of his name—including in this article, no doubt—is better than silence.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/twitter-x-rebrand-juvenile-internet-style/674875/">Read: The ugly honesty of Elon Musk&#39;s Twitter rebrand</a><br><br> A few years ago, I used the phrase “boy king” to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/how-people-inside-facebook-are-reacting-to-the-companys">describe</a> Zuckerberg, a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Boy-Kings/Katherine-Losse/9781451668261">reference</a> to an early book about Facebook. After that piece was published, a Facebook executive privately messaged me to say that such language proved I was a biased writer uninterested in a fair examination of the company. I&#39;ve been thinking about that message this summer: How is anyone to interpret the brawl-baiting and shirtless thirst traps, if not as the proclamations of attention-seeking man-children? And how can we direct our attention toward the tech industry&#39;s projects when some of its biggest names are distracting us by cosplaying as Jake Paul? I&#39;ve talked to countless Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors over the years who have complained about the “techlash,” the idea that the media has a reflexive pessimism about the technology industry and the people who run it, such that legitimate technological progress is hindered. The criticism implies that we ought to focus less on the personality and politics of the people doing the building and more on the work itself.<br><br> Musk and Zuckerberg ask that we take them seriously as titans of industry and men of importance. They demand our admiration and attention for their ideas and accomplishments much in the same way that their platforms demand our engagement. But in seeking our notice in such uniquely vapid, cynical ways, they forfeit it in others. Regardless of the reason, these are serious men who seem all too eager to show us that they are not serious men. Something needs to change. We (and, I should note, I&#39;m speaking to myself here too) must hold two contradictory ideas in our heads. These men are important insofar as their consequential business decisions must be scrutinized and held to account. But their every utterance and eyeball emoji is not worthy of our attention. These men may be important, but they are not always worth our time.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 23:03:16 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/musk-zuckerberg-rivalry-newsworthiness/675014/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/musk-zuckerberg-rivalry-newsworthiness/675014/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[I Turned My House into a Zero-Carbon Utopia]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The Inflation Reduction Act let me break up with fossil fuels. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/zdMFLlfi2UhQFqfaWaH2th5Cs5w=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/IRA_house_horz/original.jpg" alt="太阳能电池板的图像与燃气灶发出的蓝色火焰的图像混合在一起。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> The Atlantic. Sources: Getty</figcaption></figure> Last April, I decided to break up with my gas company. It wasn&#39;t me; it was them. Like so many other fossil-fuel companies, SoCalGas was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2019-08-10/socalgas-astroturf-cpuc-aliso-canyon">lobbying</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbs8.com/article/money/amped/sempra-fined-10-million-for-unlawful-lobbying/509-37f63dc0-9945-4661-b7c0-f57a64569254">against</a> clean energy while it continued to spew carbon pollution into the atmosphere. Yet here I was, an academic who had devoted my life to advancing clean energy, still paying them money, month after month. I&#39;d had enough.<br><br> But like a divorce after a long marriage, the process was even more complicated than I had thought. I had to remove all the appliances running on gas and swap them for clean, electric machines. Goodbye gas furnace. Goodbye gas stove. Goodbye gas fireplace. And good riddance. SoCalGas wasn&#39;t my sole energy provider, but I vowed to go one step further and run my home without burning <em>any fossil fuels at all</em> .<br><br> In addition to my home renovation, I was also working on a much bigger decarbonization project last year: getting a climate bill out of Congress and onto President Joe Biden&#39;s desk. Those efforts were repeatedly stymied—until out of nowhere, a year ago this week, the Inflation Reduction Act became law. By far the biggest climate bill in American history, the IRA is stuffed with programs: hundreds of billions of dollars to spur clean-energy manufacturing in the United States, push coal plants into retirement, and clean up pollution. But the parts of the law that are most quickly changing the country are the incentives that make it cheaper for Americans to break up with fossil fuels. One home improvement at a time, I&#39;ve seen firsthand just how transformative the IRA will be—and what is still needed to ensure that this law lives up to its full potential.<br><br> In a sense, my electrification journey started long before I vowed to part ways with my gas company. When I bought my electric vehicle six years ago, federal and state tax credits brought down the sticker price by $10,000. But, over time, many cars no longer qualified, making EV purchases more expensive up front. Last August&#39;s law fixed that, providing new, more generous <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/tax2023.shtml#requirements">tax credits</a> for both new and used EVs. If electric cars seem to suddenly be everywhere, this is a big reason. Even though rolling out the rules for these incentives has taken time, EV purchases have rapidly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://insideevs.com/news/657660/us-electric-car-sales-january2023/">accelerated</a> ; in California, one in every four new cars sold is now <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-08-03/newsom-electric-car-sales-in-california-reached-an-all-time-market-share-last-quarter">electric</a> .<br><br> America is finally realizing just how great these cars can be. As many other EV owners have learned, these cars are cheaper to charge than their gas cousins are to fill up at the pump, and they require less maintenance. Apart from replacing the tires, I think I&#39;ve spent $150, total. And the best is yet to come: Starting next year, buyers will be able to get their EV refund at the dealership, instead of having to claim a credit when they file their taxes.<br><br> The IRA supercharged my electrification journey. These kinds of home improvements can be expensive, but they became significantly cheaper after many of the law&#39;s provisions went into effect in January. From the beginning, I knew I wanted to cover my roof in solar panels. That way, I could generate clean energy for my house and car. I also got a battery that plugged into the solar panels so I could have backup energy at night and during a power outage. The IRA extended solar-panel <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.energy.gov/eere/solar/homeowners-guide-federal-tax-credit-solar-photovoltaics">discounts</a> that have existed for decades, and applied them to the battery costs too. This essentially made the whole system 30 percent cheaper.<br><br> Over and over again, I was greeted with discounts. At the top of my wish list was a heat pump. These machines are like magic: They draw heat from the air outside (even in the winter!) to heat water, or heat and cool the air in your home, without directly using any fossil fuels. In January, I installed two heat pumps—one for water and one for the air—and I&#39;ll get $2,000 back on my taxes next year. Last year, heat pumps <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/22/climate/heat-pumps-extreme-cold.html">outsold</a> gas furnaces, and the IRA will undoubtedly increase that margin dramatically.<br><br> With a home decked out with solar panels and heat pumps, my goal was finally in sight. One of the last and most important decisions I made was to replace my gas stove with an induction cooktop and electric ovens. From a carbon-pollution perspective, this was not the biggest project. But for my family&#39;s health, it was essential. A few months ago, I bought a small air-quality <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.iqair.com/air-quality-monitors">monitor</a> and started to observe with my own eyes what <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/17/climate/gas-stoves-benzene-cigarettes.html">scientists</a> have been telling us: Cooking with a gas stove is, by some measures, on par with secondhand smoke. No one is “taking away gas stoves,” but if you have one, you might consider replacing it. Your lungs will <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gas-stoves-emit-more-of-the-carcinogen-benzene-than-expected/">thank you</a> . With an induction cooktop, my home is healthier. And did I mention that it boils water way faster? No wonder many <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/01/gas-stove-asthma-danger-ban-debate/672725/">chefs</a> love them. They&#39;re better.<br><br> Last month, when I received a refund check from SoCalGas, I knew I&#39;d finally done it. I&#39;d severed my last connection with the company. And thanks to the IRA, it was easier than I&#39;d expected to fully electrify my home: When I file my taxes next year, I&#39;ll save thousands. But my home is just one in this country. If we want to meet our climate goals, we&#39;ll need a lot more people to go all electric, a lot faster. According to the electrification nonprofit Rewiring America, where I am a senior adviser, over the next three years we need the federal law to spur an additional <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/pace">14 million</a> clean purchases: heat pumps, solar panels, EVs, and more. And opting for clean energy at home is particularly important going forward. As climate change accelerates, our homes are becoming even more important refuges. Near the end of July, almost <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/news-wrap-nearly-200-million-americans-face-extreme-heat-severe-weather">200 million</a> Americans were under a heat or extreme-weather advisory; a month earlier, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/27/us/canada-wildfire-smoke-great-lakes/index.html">120 million</a> people had been cloaked in thick smoke.<br><br> Even with the IRA, electrification journeys like my own can be challenging. Figuring out which machines to purchase, finding contractors, and paying for the up-front cost of new appliances <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rewiringamerica.org/my-home">can be a hefty burden</a> In my case, the HVAC technician was extremely difficult to pin down, delaying the installation of my heat pumps by weeks. This is a common experience, because there&#39;s a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dept-of-energy/the-great-electrician-shortage">shortage</a> of skilled workers. Other homeowners have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/02/28/how-to-get-heat-pump-home/">found</a> that some <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2022/10/8/23387530/home-electrification-heat-pumps-gas-furnace-contractors">contractors</a> , unfamiliar with modern technology, keep recommending a gas furnace even when a client says they don&#39;t want one. Clearly, we have a ways to go on building up the electrification workforce, and unfortunately, that wasn&#39;t a big focus of the IRA funding.<br><br> Although the IRA helps, swapping out all these electric machines is expensive. We cannot just electrify wealthier households and leave disadvantaged communities hooked on fossil gas, saddled with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://fordschool.umich.edu/news/2021/poor-urban-rural-areas-could-bear-financial-burden-move-natural-gas-electricity-energy">costs</a> that will only grow as more people exit the system. The law continues the pattern of relying heavily on tax credits to support clean tech, including EVs and solar panels. Waiting a year-plus to get money back is a tough proposition for many households, even before you consider just how complicated filing taxes is. As a result, most solar adoption has happened in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://electrek.co/2022/11/04/us-rooftop-solar-adoption-income/">wealthier</a> households.<br><br> Over time, such technology should get cheaper. The IRA includes about $50 billion in funding for low-income and disadvantaged communities. Most households will also soon be able to receive upwards of $10,000 to make climate-friendly installations, including insulation and induction stoves. Plus there&#39;s an additional $7 billion for low-income households looking to install <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/biden-harris-administration-launches-7-billion-solar-all-grant-competition-fund#:~:text=WASHINGTON%20(June%2028%2C%202023),millions%20of%20low%2Dincome%20households.">solar</a> panels. The brilliance of the IRA is that the law is designed to build up clean manufacturing here in the United States, which will spur innovation and lower costs.<br><br> A year out, the IRA is like an infant that has just become a toddler: It&#39;s still too early to tell exactly how it will grow up, but the signs, so far, are promising. We can see that in the numbers—there are now more EVs and more <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-solar-power-installations-soar-q1-easing-panel-import-gridlock-2023-06-08/">solar panels</a> and, yes, many more heat pumps. But the law is so much bigger than consumer incentives for clean machines. It&#39;s also reshaping the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://climatepower.us/clean-energy-boom/">economy</a> , generating more than 170,000 new jobs and $278 billion in new investments in battery manufacturing, wind-turbine factories, and solar manufacturing plants. In another decade, the IRA—although not perfect—may prove to be an inflection point in America&#39;s relationship with fossil fuels.

Can it appeal to normies too? <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/R539wEuSB4u9YnijWQzw_Zyo3c4=/1x417:8008x4921/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/Xpogo_051022_0299/original.jpg" alt="A man does a flip on a pogo stick." referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photograph by Ben Franke</figcaption></figure> In the sweltering heat of downtown Pittsburgh, on the last Friday of June 2022, a 25-year-old from Tennessee named Dalton Smith stood in the middle of a throng of about 100 people in Market Square, clicked the strap of his helmet into place, and climbed atop his pogo stick. He tightly gripped two handlebars, his sneakers resting on two pegs affixed to the bottom of the aluminum cylinder. Then he started bouncing. He took several small hops, then one massive leap, and his body was airborne. It was at this moment that Smith took his sneakers off the pegs and spun the stick clockwise in front of his face like an airplane propeller, while clearing a horizontal bar positioned 12 feet in the air.<br><br> When Smith landed successfully on the other side, he had set the Guinness World Record for highest-ever jump on a pogo stick. And he did it on the Vurtego, perhaps the greatest pogo stick the world has ever seen. “It&#39;s the wand that makes the magic possible,” Smith, now 26, told me this summer.<br><br> The spring-loaded contraption that many of us are familiar with was introduced in America shortly after World War I. For almost 100 years, that simple pogo stick didn&#39;t change much. But when two high-school buddies who grew up on surfing, skateboarding, and snowboarding saw a friend messing with his old pogo stick at a party, they got to thinking: <em>Is there any way to reimagine a childhood toy for the extreme-sports world?</em> That&#39;s how Vurtego pogo sticks, named after the Mission Viejo, California, company that has produced them since 2005, were born.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/07/how-to-take-smart-risks/661487/">Read: The magic of a little danger</a><br><br> Unlike spring-loaded sticks, Vurtego&#39;s devices are powered by air, with shafts that pump in and out of hollow metal tubes. The air pressure inside a Vurtego stick is easily double the PSI of a standard car tire—which means a single bounce can launch a rider more than eight feet into the air. This innovation gave rise to trick pogo, a niche extreme sport centered on an annual competition called Pogopalooza. But it has also put Vurtego in a challenging position: It has to sell the thing to people who don&#39;t want to whip around at neck-breaking altitudes.<br><br> As a business imperative, it&#39;s a conundrum Vurtego has to solve, and one it&#39;ll try doing when it begins selling the Slingshot in September. The Slingshot is a shorter, lighter, easier-to-control pogo, but it&#39;s still powered by air. If the Vurtego is a sports car, then the Slingshot is the sedan anyone can drive. Vurtego says the goal is to attract a wider audience: the kids who want more of a thrill than a spring-loaded stick can provide, but also anyone willing to try something new. Yet the business motive belies a more fundamental question: Why jump on a pogo stick at all?<br><br> For Smith, a pogo stick evokes a childhood innocence, a time when the only thing you had to worry about was how high you could jump (and how to effectively bail out if the stick started going sideways). “When you jump on a pogo stick, there&#39;s just no way to not feel like a kid,” he told me. “I feel just alive and young and joyful. It gets your whole body worked up into physical joy.”<br><br> Old-school spring-loaded sticks usually bounce just a few feet into the air. The first spring-loaded stick that the Vurtego co-founder Ian Britt was involved in making sent a rider as high as five feet. The inelegant design—two old car shocks that he and a buddy welded together and stuck inside a metal tube—yielded a clunky, 60-pound contraption, but it still enabled a higher bounce. Mutual friends connected Britt with Vurtego&#39;s other co-founder, Brian Spencer, whose uncle, a former aerospace engineer, made the key contribution: air instead of springs. To make a spring stick reach world-record heights, you need metal with a thicker gauge, which weighs it down. Compressed air is lighter and can be adjusted on the fly with a bike pump. That&#39;s what allows for insane height: More air pressure equals more altitude.<br><br> The Vurtego stick used by most of the athletes at Pogopalooza is the V4, the latest in the company&#39;s line of trick-pogo equipment. Though the stunts guys like Smith bust out are breathtaking to behold—have you ever <em>seen</em> someone do<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/ajzaleski/status/1564945715029237761">three backflips on a pogo stick</a> ?—the V4 itself is inaccessible to the masses. The cylinder is aluminum, the shaft is heavy stainless steel, the pogo is more than four feet tall from shaft to handlebars, and the price is $499.<br><br> By comparison, the Slingshot is $149 or $159, depending on the model size: extra-small or small. Materials that Vurtego was able to access only in the past several years enabled the design. The cylinder in this stick consists of six layers of pressure-rolled aluminum. The shaft is aluminum. The pegs are a special blend of thermoplastic and nylon, with glass-filled fibers inserted for additional strength. The pogo itself is shorter. And unlike the V4, which Smith describes as “super punchy and poppy,” the bounce of the Slingshot, according to those who have tried it, is slow and cushioned.<br><br> “It&#39;s a lot less intimidating to start with something like the Slingshot, where it doesn&#39;t look like you&#39;re automatically going to break a bone,” says Will Weiner, the CEO and co-founder of Xpogo, the Pittsburgh-based governing body of trick pogo that hosts the annual high-flying contest. “I really think it&#39;s kind of the missing link we&#39;ve been looking for.”<br><br> Getting someone to embrace pogo as a leisure activity seems like a long shot. If anything, the Slingshot appears more suited to the trick-stick wannabes, the younger generation that isn&#39;t ready for the jolt of a larger pogo stick.<br><br> And that makes sense. Why give a 10-year-old a pogo stick that&#39;s one errant bounce from sending them face-first into pavement? Britt told me that the Slingshot is just the first of two new pogo sticks that Vurtego plans to roll out. Next spring, the company will release the V5, its newest stick for the Pogopalooza set, which will incorporate the softer, trampolinelike bounce of the Slingshot. In fact, an early test model of the V5 is what Smith used to hit his high-jump mark a year ago.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/06/extreme-heat-events-summer-vacation-kids/674401/">Read: Summer vacation is moving indoors</a><br><br> But what makes the Slingshot a presumably easier pogo stick is the same thing that makes it more than just a set of vertical training wheels for an aspiring back-flipper: Anyone can jump on it. That makes it a gateway into unstructured, nostalgic fun, free from the contemplative pressures that weigh down so much of daily life.<br><br> “If you go skiing, most people are on the bunny slopes. There&#39;s not many people that are flying in the terrain park,” Britt said. “Most people just want to go up to the mountain, have a couple beers, and chill and have fun. This is our version of that.”<br><br> The reason a new pogo stick might matter is because of how <em>little</em> it matters overall: a little buoyancy in a heavy world. Not long before I observed the scene in Pittsburgh, I&#39;d found out I have a particular type of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.gq.com/story/muscular-dystrophy-wellness">muscular dystrophy</a> , a degenerative disease that causes my body to progressively break down. I&#39;ll never bounce on a Vurtego or a Slingshot or any of the others, but I can appreciate what they represent. Witnessing pogo stunts in person gave me a newfound appreciation for frivolity.<br><br> Smith sees his time on a pogo stick as a bridge into the imagination. He remembers when he first started watching YouTube videos of others doing tricks on pogo sticks, and then trying to emulate what he saw. The act, he says, was like playing a character. “It&#39;s so absurd in a way, but it&#39;s so playful,” he said. “That&#39;s at the root of nostalgia, and feeling young and naive.”<br><br> This summer, he spent a couple of months at Legoland in Florida performing in a scripted sports show. He was there with his Vurtego, bouncing on stage as “Mike,” a jackhammer operator. The pogo stick, of course, was the jackhammer.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 18:57:24 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/vurtego-pogo-stick-extreme-pogo/675011/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/vurtego-pogo-stick-extreme-pogo/675011/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The GOP Primary Is a Field of Broken Dreams]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Donald Trump stole the show at the Iowa State Fair.
