“所有联盟的历史都是盟友相互抱怨的故事。”温斯顿·丘吉尔如是说道，他知道自己在说什么。今年夏天的不满情绪中充斥着抱怨：乌克兰官员迫切需要武器，而西方外交官和士兵则认为乌克兰人对他们收到的坦克、训练和其他物资忘恩负义。<br><br>西方的大部分批评都发生在上个月在立陶宛维尔纽斯举行的北约峰会期间和周边地区，通过匿名泄密和公众抱怨。事实上，根据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2023/07/13/zelensky-ukraine-nato-invitation/">一份报告</a><u>，</u>美国政府对弗拉基米尔·泽连斯基对加入北约进程缓慢的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/ZelenskyyUa/status/1678707674811187200?s=20">抱怨</a>感到非常恼火，以至于一些人主张淡化有关基辅加入北约的措辞。在他们看来，从公报中撤回“<em>邀请”</em>一词是对恶意推文的适当惩罚。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ukraine-war-us-aid-nato/674747/">菲利普斯·佩森·奥布莱恩：停止对乌克兰战争进行微观管理</a><br><br>人们对这里表现出的暴躁态度感到倒吸一口冷气，就像英国国防部长本·华莱士(Ben Wallace)关于乌克兰将其西方供应商视为一种武器亚马逊的言论一样。<br><br>对盟友的不满是所有高级外交官和国家安全官员最终都会经历的一种常见且可以理解的情绪。他们的脑海中迟早会出现这样的独白：<br><br><em>如果我每周能睡个好觉，我就很幸运了。我在孩子起床之前下班，在他们睡着后回来，每周工作六天，有时是七天。我强调吃饭，如果不被叫回办公室就不能休假。与此同时，每个人都认为[插入盟友的名字]是一群受害者或英雄，而事实上，他们是一群善于操纵、忘恩负义的小混蛋，他们不知道我正在做什么来拯救他们免受[说出一个竞争对手的名字]官方、国家或政府部门]。他们的美国同情者是一群令人讨厌的傻瓜，他们同样无知，但借口更少。</em><br><br>在这种情况下，成年人应该做的事情是锻炼身体，向深爱的配偶抱怨，或者把这些想法写在日记中，以供历史学家欣赏，他们会在冷静的事后看来，过多地解读那些仅仅是发脾气的事情。向媒体提及它们，或者更糟糕的是，对它们采取行动是不公平和不负责任的。<br><br>当官员们的愤怒压制了他们的同理心时，这种爆发就会发生。在哀鸣最严重的时刻，他们忘记了被占领的国家五分之一意味着什么，或者知道一个更大的国家每天晚上都试图摧毁你的发电厂，封锁你的港口，毁坏你的庄稼。他们并没有把被摧毁的城镇和万人坑放在首位。他们不知道欢迎被阉割的交换战俘回来是什么感觉。或者哀悼被谋杀的老年男女，或者遭受酷刑和强奸的年轻男女。或者疯狂地担心数千名儿童被绑架。他们忘记了，西方官员的睡眠可能会被电话或闹钟打断，而乌克兰官员的睡眠更有可能（而且更经常）被警报器或导弹撞击公寓楼的撞击打断。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2023/07/russia-kidnapping-abducting-ukrainian-children/674535/">阅读：俄罗斯被绑架的儿童</a><br><br>乌克兰官员对此表示感谢。分析他们的演讲可以看出他们表达了很多感激之情。但他们也坚持不懈地大声呼救。如果他们是其他人，那就既不人道，又玩忽职守。希望在返回华盛顿或伦敦的飞机上喝一两杯威士忌后，西方官员能够冷静下来，在理解他们陷入困境的盟友方面恢复到一定程度的成熟。<br><br>不幸的是，抱怨背后的冲动也可以以更微妙但同样有害的形式表现出来。关于乌克兰的大部分公开讨论都显示出一种偏袒该国和其他逃离俄罗斯统治的国家的倾向。正如爱沙尼亚前总统托马斯·伊尔维斯 (Toomas Ilves) 尖刻地评论道：“20 世纪 70 年代中期我上大学时，没有人称德国为‘前第三帝国’。”然而今天，柏林墙倒塌 30 多年后，我们仍然被称为“前苏联集团国家”。国会议员以微薄的手段进入众议院或参议院，离开时成为千万富翁，或者为什么美国总统的孩子们从外国发财，或者就此而言，为什么纽约市的建筑如此昂贵。<br><br>西方屈尊俯就的最新、最充分的例子出现在德国军事情报部门的一份报告中，该报告抱怨说，尽管乌克兰人在训练课程中是好学生，但他们没有遵循西方的学说，更糟糕的是，他们根据战斗经验而不是晋升军官。比理论知识。类似的，尽管不那么尖锐，五角大楼也泄露了一些观点。<br><br>德国军方对任何国家作战表现的批评可能持保留态度。毕竟，联邦国防军已经有近八年没有经历过严重的战斗了。在阿富汗，德国因在任何时候只有不到10%的数千名驻军驻扎在其前沿作战基地之外而臭名昭著。人们可能会进一步观察到，很久以前，当德国军队确实打仗时，它也倾向于提拔经验丰富、成功的战斗领导人，就像战时军队通常所做的那样。<br><br>美国对乌克兰反攻速度及其未能实现快速突破的抱怨同样是错误的。乌克兰确实收到了各种各样的坦克和装甲车，但他们的扫雷设备远远少于他们需要的。他们试图按照我们的方式行事——试图突破俄罗斯密集的防御并闯入开阔的领土——并付出了代价。 10天后，他们决定采取不同的方法，更加谨慎和渐进，并且更适合他们自己的能力（特别是他们的精确远程武器）和他们面临的挑战。也就是说，按照历史标准，快速适应。相比之下，美国陆军花了整整四年的时间才制定了一种在伊拉克反叛乱的作战方法，并成功击败了复兴党政权的残余势力和基地组织恐怖分子。<br><br>大型军队，尤其是美国军队的一个常犯的错误是认为他们的方式要么是最好的方式，要么是唯一的方式。由于这种假设，美国在面临叛乱或外部威胁的较小盟友中建立了劣质的镜像军队。这些部队往往会失败，因为他们不适合自己的环境，或者只是缺乏美军拥有的充足资源。越南军队和后来的阿富汗军队就是这种趋势的好例子——华盛顿在战后对其被屠杀的客户唱衰，而不是对其为之设置的目的进行批判性的自我审视，这是应受谴责的。<br><br>乌克兰人现在正在进行一场缓慢而耐心的战争，他们正在拆除俄罗斯的火炮、弹药库和指挥所，而没有美国的反坦克导弹和德国的金牛座导弹等武器，这将使这种明智的做法更快、更有效。他们对与俄罗斯人作战的了解比任何西方军队中的任何人都多得多，而且他们正在经历二战以来西方军队从未遇到过的战斗环境。谦虚从来都不是美国人的强项，但却是合理的。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/ukraine-victory-russia-defeat/674112/">艾略特·A·科恩：乌克兰获胜还不够。俄罗斯必须输。</a><br><br>增进乌克兰朋友间了解的一种方法是在基辅设立大量军事使馆。美国上校和将军不必去巡逻或防风暴树线，但他们会从与乌克兰同行持续的、国内的、面对面的接触中受益。他们将能够传达对战斗以及乌克兰战术和作战要求的现实评估。他们还将向乌克兰保证视频会议无法做到这一点，并且或许会给华盛顿的审议带来一点谦逊。<br><br>这样的努力会带来风险，但这正是士兵们报名参加的。在乌克兰保持持续的实际存在并执行高级别军事任务，并辅以美国欧洲司令部负责人和其他高级领导人的频繁访问，对于做出有助于乌克兰击败俄罗斯、夺回领土的判断是非常宝贵的。并赢得这场战争。胜利才是一切，而不是抱怨。<br><br></div>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>卡西迪·阿拉扎 / Redux</figcaption></figure>在凤凰城，108 华氏度的高温现在在某种程度上算得上是一个喘息的机会。周一，美国最热的主要城市结束了连续 31 天气温突破 110 度的不祥天气。这种高温造成的损失——7 月平均气温为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/08/01/weather/phoenix-us-heatwave-streak-climate/index.html">102.7 度</a>——是残酷的。一名妇女在自家门外的人行道上摔倒后被送往医院的烧伤科，高耸的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-wave-phoenix-cactus-plants-974dfd0a5b19f804837d90a96b567ede">仙人掌</a>失去了手臂并倒下了。过去一个月， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/17/weather/southwest-us-arizona-record-heat/index.html">医院</a>收治烧伤和中暑患者的能力达到了自疫情最严重时期以来的最高水平。<br><br> “为什么有人会住在凤凰城？”您可能会向数十万新居民提出这个问题，正是他们使亚利桑那州大都市成为美国发展最快的城市。去年，凤凰城所在的马里科帕县的居民数量超过了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/population-estimates-counties.html?utm_source=newsletter&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=newsletter_axiosam&amp;stream=top">美国任何其他县</a>，与 2021 年、2019 年、2018 年和 2017 年的情况一样。<br><br>从本质上讲，这个问题使一些根本不神秘的事情变得神秘。对于许多人来说，住在凤凰城非常有意义。 80 年来，一年中大部分时间宜人的气温、相对便宜的住房以及稳定增加的经济机会吸引了人们，将这座城市从一个拥有 65,000 人的沙漠小前哨变成了一个拥有超过 500 万人口的庞大都市区。一路走来，一系列的创新让高温对许多居民来说似乎只是暂时的不便，而不是生存威胁。也许即使是像这样的热浪也不会改变任何事情。<br><br> 20 多年前，我在凤凰城的第一个早晨，太阳冲破了地平线，在美国最大的市政公园之一的南山公园的一条小道上两英里处。前一天晚上，我从密歇根州抵达，留下了中西部三月下旬的沉闷春天，进行了几个月的研究，这些研究后来成为我的书《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/power-lines-phoenix-and-the-making-of-the-modern-southwest-andrew-needham/9780691173542?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>电力线》</em></a> 。当太阳把山变成金色的时候，我几个月来第一次脱下短袖，我意识到了太阳谷的魅力。<br><br>在夏季之外，凤凰城的生活质量确实相当高——城市支持者早在二战之前就一直在宣传这一事实。他们用干燥的“盐河谷”换来了热情好客的“太阳谷”。淡化凤凰城气候危险的努力可以追溯到更早的时候。 1895年，当凤凰城还只有几千人时，当地一家报纸报道称，“数据和事实”证明，炎热天气“纯属笑话”，因为人们所经历的“体感温度”远低于此。比温度计记录的严重。 “但天气干燥”由来已久，一代又一代的准新移民被教导认为凤凰城的气候有利多于压抑。<br><br>大多数人搬到凤凰城肯定不是因为天气，而是因为住房。太阳谷对新住房开发的持续承诺继续使房价远低于邻近的加利福尼亚州，吸引了许多因高房价而离开金州的移民。灌溉农田似乎一夜之间就出现了细分。 1955 年，当房屋建筑商约翰·F·朗 (John F. Long) 在凤凰城西部边缘建造玛丽维尔 (Maryvale) 时，他很快将一个哈密瓜农场改造成七栋样板房。五年后，该社区居住人数超过 22,000 人；现在超过200,000人这样做。即使在今天，建设速度也会造成混乱，因为居民们对 Heartland Ranch 或 Copper Falls 或其他新分区的位置感到困惑，这些新分区包括自 2010 年以来建造的 250,000 套房屋中的大部分。<br><br>即使在夏天，您也可能不会总是注意到凤凰城的地形有多么恶劣。开发商为确保水权而斗争，开采地下水含水层，从科罗拉多河中取水，通过渡槽输送到城市，并从当地农民那里购买水。空调是凤凰城的命脉，就像纽约的地铁系统一样，是这座城市的一部分。 1961 年，凤凰城银行家赫伯特·莱格特 (Herbert Leggett) 向<em>《周六晚邮报》</em>讲述了他平常的夏日生活：“早上，我在装有空调的家里醒来……我穿好衣服，钻进装有空调的汽车，开往空中- 空调车库位于该大楼的地下室。我在有空调的办公室工作，在有空调的餐厅吃饭，也许还去有空调的剧院。”<br><br>在莱格特描述的空调泡沫中，像我这样在室内工作的人实际上有可能忘记凤凰城夏季的炎热和压抑，直到我们不得不匆忙穿过停车场或穿过混凝土广场建筑物之间。从 4 月下旬开始，高温经常达到 90 华氏度以上，许多居民都会打开空调，一直使用到 10 月份，最高气温再次降至 80 华氏度。盛夏时节，凤凰城白天几乎变成了一座室内城市。远程汽车启动器成为缓解炎热天气的宝贵便利设施。跑步者在黎明前醒来锻炼身体，在三位数的日子里， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.azhumane.org/news/abc-15-hiking-ban/#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20two%20years,and%20six%20months%20in%20jail.">狗</a>被禁止进入城市公园的远足小径。对于凤凰城的许多居民来说，有了空调，利大于弊。<br><br>但这种生活方式是有代价的。凤凰城的用电量猛增，从 1970 年至今，平均家庭用电量几乎翻了一番。四角发电厂是菲尼克斯以北为帮助该地区发展而建设的五座燃煤发电厂之一，在其运营高峰期，该发电厂每年排放<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.gem.wiki/Four_Corners_Steam_Plant">1,600 万吨</a>碳，相当于年排放量的 3.4% 以上。万辆汽车。即使在今天，随着大多数燃煤发电的退役，菲尼克斯仍然严重依赖排放碳的天然气来发电。凤凰城能源的过去和现在都加剧了当地居民试图逃离的炎热天气。<br><br>空调可以保护大多数人，但尤其是随着炎热的天气加剧，那些没有空调的人会变得非常脆弱。独居老年妇女尤其<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/becoming-arizona-lessons-from-phoenix">容易受到影响</a>，其中许多人难以维护和支付空调费用，她们是室内高温相关死亡的大多数。凤凰城无家可归者的人口在过去六年里增加了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/us/phoenix-heat-wave.html#:~:text=It%20was%20a%20record%20high,heat%20days%20is%20also%20growing.">70%</a> ，他们承受着巨大的痛苦，并构成了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/climate/news/becoming-arizona-lessons-from-phoenix">死亡人数</a>的很大一部分。最近，一名无家可归的男子将坐在轮椅上比作“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2023/07/13/phoenix-heat-wave-conditions/">坐在热炭上</a>”。<br><br>这股热浪将会结束，但还会有另一股热浪。尽管如此，115度高温下的恐怖故事并不能保证凤凰城的爆炸性增长会受到阻碍。目前，菲尼克斯都市区有 80,000 套新住宅已获得建筑许可，但尚未开始建设，这些住宅将需要更多的水、更多的空调和更多的能源。<br><br>但从某种意义上说，凤凰城并没有什么异常之处。 Leggett 所描述的从有空调的空间到有空调的空间的转变——以及使这一切运行所需的大量能源——现在在一个近 90% 的家庭使用空调的国家中很常见。 Land&#39;s End 等服装公司<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.landsend.com/article/best-summer-sweaters-for-the-office/">在广告中宣传</a>夏季毛衣，“当你在办公室里努力工作八小时时，这些毛衣会为你提供帮助，有时你会感觉办公室就像一个冰箱。”酷热夺走了奥马哈、西雅图和波士顿等“温带”城市的生命。事实上，2020 年的一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.lww.com/environepidem/Fulltext/2020/06000/Estimating_the_number_of_excess_deaths.1.aspx?context=LatestArticles">研究</a>得出的结论是，东北部地区因高温导致的超额死亡率最高。<br><br> “为什么有人会住在凤凰城？”只不过是一种防御机制。它使大量美国人在经济压力下做出的选择变得奇怪——选择搬到气候温暖的阳光地带，搬到住房负担得起的地方，忽视能源的来源及其造成的不平等，以及最重要的是，淡化气候变化的威胁。从这一点来看，凤凰城也不例外。这是常态。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 16:36:00

维持生计。即使是运动员也不鼓励在田野和赛道上喝水，以免过量的液体减慢他们的速度。 “我无法告诉你有多少人说我很愚蠢，”斯托基告诉我，因为他是为数不多的水倡导者之一。<br><br>但在世纪之交，补水成为了美国人的一种迷恋。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/celebrities-and-bottled-w_b_705534">名人</a>在杂志上宣传水的好处；超市货架上的品牌瓶子占满了。关于水合作用的学术研究经历了一次小繁荣。经过多年的持续口渴之后，我们突然开始喝酒、喝酒、喝酒，因为我们觉得我们应该这样做。这是一个水生大转弯——而且完全没有科学意义。<br><br>从抽象的角度来看，水合作用的重要性是无可争议的。水让我们的器官保持运转，让我们的肌肉保持敏捷；它有助于在体内分配营养并维持我们的内部恒温器。把它拿走，细胞就不可避免地死亡。但充足水摄入量的具体细节在很大程度上仍然是一团糟。对于水合作用，“没有明确的数字，也没有必须维持的阈值，”德克萨斯理工大学的运动表现科学家 Yasuki Sekiguchi 说。对于<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/10/12/1928">人们需要多少水</a>，或者判断什么时候应该喝水的最佳方法，专家们<a data-event-element="inline link"

升（均包括食物中的水分）。最近，耶鲁大学生理学研究员阿比盖尔·科尔伯恩和她的同事<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35943601/">进行了一项分析</a>，得出的结论是这些数字是合理的。尽管如此，这些数字还是来自<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28614817/">量化</a>个人的脱水程度时，追踪这些结果变得更加复杂——这是专家们无法达成一致的另一件事。约翰逊告诉我：“我们确实没有一个衡量水合作用的黄金标准，尤其是一个既简单又便宜，并且可以解释体内水分恒定通量的标准。”这给科学家留下了不完美的代理。斯托基告诉我，从广义上讲，有一个尿营和一个血营。那些持小便阵营的人往往是水分保守派。他们认为，尿液颜色或体积的变化是即将脱水的早期迹象（远远早于口渴）。血营的船员们更加自由放任。<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25346594/">饮食、药物和补充剂</a>都会改变尿液的颜色，使其成为一个变化无常的线索。例如，休-巴特勒将真正的脱水定义为当血浆变得比平常更咸时发生的情况，达到细胞开始收缩的程度，这表明保留水分不再足够，身体需要喝水<em>。</em><br><br>研究人员属于哪个阵营会<a

href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28614817/">他们对美国饮水问题的严重程度的看法</a>。 “当你抽血时，大多数人如果不口渴，就会处于正常范围内，”休-巴特勒告诉我。但坚定支持小便阵营的斯托基认为，大多数美国人“走路都脱水”，应该喝更多的水。科尔伯恩也宁愿留意尿液的警告信号。当口渴时，“你已经处于危险区域了，”她告诉我。<br><br>可以有一个中间立场。德克萨斯理工大学的关口告诉我，对于大多数年轻、健康的人来说，他们在空调室内度过了很多时间——正如许多美国人所做的那样——口渴时喝水可能没问题。 （这个建议对老年人不太有效，因为随着年龄的增长，口渴的感觉往往会变得迟钝。）当特定情况发生变化时——一段剧烈运动，一周的舒适日子——人们会注意到，并做出相应的调整。<br><br>但随着热浪变得更加频繁和强烈，在典型条件下的典型饮水指南很快就会被淘汰。当气温飙升和湿度使原本凉爽的汗水顽固地粘在皮肤上时，我们的身体需要更多的水来保持凉爽和功能，这超出了口渴所能带来的影响。关口告诉我，部分问题在于口渴消失的速度比身体补充水分的速度快，这意味着那些一直喝到<em>觉得</em>饱的人往往只能补充他们流失的一小部分液体。<br><br><br> “我们永远无法告诉人们确切的数字，”科尔伯恩告诉我，关于喝多少酒。但实际上，许多最担心将水分调整到完美水平的健康人可能是<em>最</em>不需要担心的人。水的危险往往不是发生在这些中间地带，而是发生在极端情况下——特别是当<a data-event-element="inline link"

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊插图</figcaption></figure>上周，俄亥俄州托莱多市的一个教堂大厅里挤满了<span class="smallcaps">大约 150 人</span>，参加了周四晚上的竞选集会，当晚的圣歌内容是在上帝的殿中通常不鼓励的脏话。<br><br> “恕我直言，牧师，绝对不！”俄亥俄州前总检察长贝蒂·蒙哥马利喊道。 Montgomery is a Republican, which gave the largely Democratic audience even more reason to roar with approval. They had gathered at the Warren AME Church, in Toledo, to voice their opposition to a constitutional amendment that Ohio voters will approve or reject in a statewide referendum on August 8. Many of those in the boisterous crowd were experiencing a feeling unfamiliar to Democrats in the state over the past decade: optimism.<br><br> If enacted, the Republican-backed proposal known as Issue 1 would raise the bar for any future changes to the state constitution. Currently, constitutional amendments in Ohio—including the one on next week&#39;s ballot—need only a bare majority of voters to pass; the proposal seeks to make the threshold a 60-percent supermajority.<br><br> In other years, a rules tweak like this one might pass without much notice. But next week&#39;s referendum has galvanized Democratic opposition inside and outside Ohio, turning what the GOP had hoped would be a sleepy summertime election into an expensive partisan proxy battle. Conservatives have argued that making the constitution harder to amend would protect Ohio from liberal efforts to raise the minimum wage, tighten gun laws, and fight climate change. But the Republican-controlled legislature clearly timed this referendum to intercept a progressive march on one issue in particular: Ohioans will decide in November whether to make access to abortion a constitutional right, and the outcome of next week&#39;s vote could mean the difference between victory and defeat for backers of abortion rights.<br><br> A year after the fall of <i>Roe v. Wade</i> , the back-to-back votes will also test whether abortion as an issue can still propel voters to the polls in support of Democratic candidates and causes. If the abortion-rights side wins next week and in November, Ohio would become the largest GOP-controlled state to enshrine abortion protections into law. The abortion-rights movement is trying to replicate the success it found last summer in another red state, Kansas, where voters <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/08/kansas-abortion-vote/671029/">decisively</a> rejected an amendment that would have allowed the legislature to ban abortion, presaging a midterm election in which Democrats performed better than expected in states where abortion rights were under threat.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/08/kansas-abortion-vote/671029/">Read: The Kansas abortion shocker</a><br><br> To prevent Democratic attempts to circumvent conservative state legislatures, Republican lawmakers have sought to restrict ballot initiatives across the country. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/democracy-ballot-initiatives-abortion-republicans-ohio-missouri-c48033311370f071ccece0da975818cb">Similar efforts</a> are under way or have already won approval in states including Florida, Missouri, North Dakota, and Idaho. But to Democrats in Ohio and beyond, the August special election is perhaps the most brazen effort yet by Republicans to subvert the will of voters. Polls show that in Ohio, the abortion-rights amendment is likely to win more than 50 percent of the vote, as have similar ballot measures in other states. For Republicans to propose raising the threshold three months before the abortion vote in November looks like a transparent bid to move the proverbial goalposts right when their opponents are about to score.<br><br> “I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen such a naked attempt to stay in power,” a former Democratic governor of Ohio, Dick Celeste, told the church crowd in Toledo. As in Kansas a year ago, the Republican majority in the state legislature scheduled the referendum for August—a time when the party assumed turnout would be low and favorable to their cause. (Adding to the Democratic outrage is the fact that just a few months earlier, Ohio Republicans had voted to restrict local governments from holding August elections, because they tend to draw so few people.) “They&#39;re trying to slip it in,” Kelsey Suffel, a Democratic voter from Perrysburg, told me after she had cast an early vote.<br><br> That Ohio Republicans would try a similar gambit so soon after the defeat their counterparts suffered in Kansas struck many Democrats as a sign of desperation. “The winds of change are blowing,” Celeste said in Toledo. “They&#39;re afraid, and they should be afraid, because the people won&#39;t tolerate it.”<br><br> The upcoming vote will serve as an important measure of strength for Ohio Democrats ahead of elections in the state next year that could determine control of Congress. Democrats have had a long losing streak in Ohio. Donald Trump easily won the state in 2016 and 2020, and Republicans have won every statewide office except for that of Senator Sherrod Brown, who faces reelection next year. Still, there&#39;s reason to believe Celeste is right to be optimistic. A Suffolk University <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.suffolk.edu/-/media/suffolk/documents/academics/research-at-suffolk/suprc/polls/other-states/2023/7_27_2023_ohio_complete_marginals.pdf?la=en&amp;hash=42FBDC0644C32CA314BE6910742B0C7A02158769">poll</a> released last week found that 57 percent of registered voters planned to vote against Issue 1. (A private survey commissioned by a nonpartisan group also found the August amendment losing, a Republican who had seen the results told me on the condition of anonymity.) Early-voting numbers have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2023/08/01/early-vote-figures-continue-their-tear-in-ohios-august-special-election/">swamped</a> predictions of low participation in an August election, suggesting that abortion remains a key motivator for getting people to turn out. Groups opposing the amendment have significantly outspent supporters of the change.<br><br> Abortion isn&#39;t explicitly on the ballot in Ohio next week, but the clear linkage between this referendum and the one on reproductive rights in November has divided the Republican coalition. Although the state&#39;s current Republican governor, Mike DeWine, backs Issue 1, the two living GOP former governors, Bob Taft and John Kasich, oppose it as an overreach by the legislature.<br><br> “That&#39;s the giant cloud on this issue,” Steve Stivers, a former Republican member of Congress who now heads the Ohio Chamber of Commerce, told me. The Chamber of Commerce backs the amendment because, as Stivers said, it&#39;ll help stop “bad ideas” such as raising the minimum wage, marijuana legalization, and proposals supported by organized labor. But, he said, many of his members were worried that the group would be dragged into a fight over abortion, on which it wants to stay neutral: “The timing is not ideal.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/06/abortion-rights-issue-2024-election/674504/">Read: It&#39;s abortion, stupid</a><br><br> Democrats have highlighted comments from Republicans who have departed from the party&#39;s official message and drawn a connection between the August referendum and the abortion vote this fall. “They&#39;ve all said the quiet part out loud, which is this election is 100 percent about trying to prevent abortion rights from having a fair election in the fall,” the state Democratic chair, Liz Walters, told me.<br><br> But to broaden its coalition, opponents of the amendment have advanced a simpler argument—preserve “majority rule”—that also seems to be resonating with voters. “I&#39;m in favor of democracy,” explained Ed Moritz, an 85-year-old retired college professor standing outside his home in Cleveland, when I asked him why he was planning to vote no. Once a national bellwether, Ohio has become close to a one-party state in recent years. For Democrats, citizen-led constitutional amendments represent one of the few remaining checks on a legislature dominated by Republicans. Moritz noted that the GOP had already gerrymandered the Ohio legislature by drawing maps to ensure its future majorities. “This,” he said, “is an attempt to gerrymander the entire population.”<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">o Frank LaRose</span> , the suggestion that Issue 1 represents an assault on democracy is “hyperbole.” LaRose is Ohio&#39;s Republican secretary of state and, of late, the public face of Issue 1. Traversing Ohio over the past few weeks, he&#39;s used the suddenly high-profile campaign as a launching pad for his bid for the Republican nomination for Senate in 2024.<br><br> LaRose, 44, served for eight years in the state Senate before becoming Ohio&#39;s top elections officer in 2019. (He won a second term last year.) He&#39;s a smooth debater and quick on his feet, but on the Issue 1 campaign, he&#39;s not exactly exuding confidence.<br><br> In an interview, he began by rattling off a litany of complaints about the opposition&#39;s messaging, which he called “intentionally misleading.” LaRose accused Issue 1&#39;s opponents of trying to bamboozle conservative voters with literature showing images of the Constitution being cut to pieces and equating the amendment with “Stop the Steal.” “That&#39;s completely off base,” he said. “We&#39;ve had to compete with that and with a mountain of money that they&#39;ve had, and with a pretty organized and intentional effort by the media on this.”<br><br> LaRose likes to remind people that even if voters approve Issue 1, citizens would still be able to pass, with a simple majority, ballot initiatives to create or repeal statutes in Ohio law. The August proposal applies only to the state constitution, which LaRose said is not designed for policy making. Left unsaid, however, is that unlike an amendment to the constitution, any statutory change approved by the voters could swiftly be reversed by the Republican majority in the legislature.<br><br> “Imagine if the US Constitution changed every year,” he said. “What instability would that create? Well, that&#39;s what&#39;s at risk if we don&#39;t pass Issue 1.” LaRose&#39;s argument ignored the fact that Ohio&#39;s rules for constitutional amendments have been in place for more than a century and, during that time, just 19 of the 77 changes proposed by citizen petitions have passed. (Many others generated by the legislature have won approval by the voters.)<br><br> LaRose has been spending a lot of his time explaining the amendment to confused voters, including Republicans. When I spoke with him last weekend, he had just finished addressing about two dozen people inside a cavernous 19th-century church in Steubenville. He described his stump speech as a “seventh-grade civics class” in which he explained the differences between the rarely amended federal Constitution and Ohio&#39;s routinely amended founding document. The laws that Ohio could be saddled with if the voters reject Issue 1, LaRose warned, went far beyond abortion: “It&#39;s every radical West Coast policy that they can think of that they want to bring to Ohio.”<br><br> The challenges LaRose has faced in selling voters on the proposal soon became apparent. When I asked a pair of women who had questioned LaRose during his speech whether he had persuaded them, one simply replied, “No.” Another frustrated attendee who supported the proposal told LaRose that she had encountered voters who didn&#39;t understand the merits of the idea.<br><br> Republicans have had to spend more time than they&#39;d like defending their claim that Issue 1 is not simply an effort to head off November&#39;s abortion amendment. They have also found themselves playing catch-up on an election that they placed on the ballot. “They got out of the gate earlier than our side,” the state Republican Party chair, Alex Triantafilou, told me, referring to an early round of TV ads that opposition groups began running throughout the state.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/bernie-moreno-republican-ohio-senate-race/621490/">David Frum: The humiliating Ohio Senate race</a><br><br> The GOP&#39;s struggle to sell its proposal to voters adds to the perception that the party, in placing the measure on the ballot, was acting not from a position of strength but of weakness. The thinly disguised effort to preempt a simple-majority vote on abortion is surely a concession by Republicans that they are losing on the issue even in what has become a reliably red state.<br><br> When I asked LaRose to respond to the concerns about abortion that Stivers reported from his members in the Chamber of Commerce, he lamented that it was another example of businesses succumbing to “cancel culture.”<br><br> C <span class="smallcaps">onfidence can be dangerous</span> for a Democrat in Ohio. Barack Obama carried the state twice, but in both 2016 and 2020, late polls showing a tight race were proved wrong by two eight-point Trump victories. A similar trajectory played out last year, when the Republican JD Vance pulled away from the Democrat Tim Ryan in the closing weeks to secure a seven-point victory in Ohio&#39;s Senate race.<br><br> “Democrats in the state are beaten down,” says Matt Caffrey, the Columbus-based organizing director for Swing Left, a national group that steers party donors and volunteers to key races across the country. He&#39;s seen the decline firsthand, telling me of the challenge Democrats have had in recruiting canvassers and engaging voters who have grown more discouraged with each defeat.<br><br> That began to change this summer, Caffrey told me. Volunteers have flocked to canvassing events in large numbers, some for the first time—a highly unusual occurrence for a midsummer special election, he said. At a canvass launch I attended in Akron over the weekend, more than three dozen people showed up, including several first-timers. As I followed Democratic canvassers there and in Cleveland over two days last week, not a single voter who answered their door was unaware of the election or undecided about how they&#39;d vote. “It&#39;s kind of an easy campaign,” Michael Todd, a canvasser with the group Ohio Citizen Action in Cleveland, told me. “Not a whole lot of convincing needs to be done.”<br><br> The response has prompted some Democrats to see the August election as an unexpected opportunity to reawaken a moribund state party. The referendum is a first for Swing Left, which has exclusively invested in candidate races since it formed after Trump&#39;s victory in 2016. “It&#39;s a great example of what we&#39;re seeing across the country, which is the fight for reproductive freedom and the fight for democracy becoming closely attached,” the group&#39;s executive director, Yasmin Radjy, told me in Akron. “We also think it&#39;s really important to build momentum in Ohio, a state that we need to keep investing in.”<br><br> A win next week would make the abortion referendum a heavy favorite to pass in November. And although Ohio is unlikely to regain its status as a presidential swing state in 2024, it could help determine control of Congress. Brown&#39;s bid for a fourth term is expected to be one of the hardest-fought Senate races in the country, and at least three Ohio districts could be up for grabs in the closely divided House.<br><br> For Democrats like Caffrey, the temptation to think bigger about a comeback in Ohio is tempered by the lingering uncertainty about next week&#39;s outcome—whether the party will finally close out a victory in a state that has turned red, or confront another disappointment. “It would be hard for Democrats in Ohio to feel complacent. I wish we would be in a position to feel complacent,” Caffrey said with a smile. “This is more about building hope.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 16:04:26 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-issue-1-special-election-abortion/674923/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/08/ohio-issue-1-special-election-abortion/674923/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Doctors Suddenly Got Way Better at Treating Eczema]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> New drugs target specific parts of the immune system, with startling results. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/NoPljLvY0uAxTP-Qohxpp4sNRKA=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/eczema_1/original.jpg" alt="一只张开的手映衬在蓝天上，设置在黑色框架内，周围散布着红色和蓝色的点" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊插图。资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure> Up until a few years ago, Heather Sullivan&#39;s 14-year-old son, Sawyer, had struggled with eczema his entire life. When he was just a baby, most of his body would be covered in intensely itchy rashes that bled and oozed when he couldn&#39;t help but scratch. His family tried steroid creams, wet wraps, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/atopic-dermatitis-eczema/expert-answers/eczema-bleach-bath/faq-20058413">bleach baths</a> , and all of the lotions. They tore up their carpet and replaced their sheetrock in hopes of eliminating triggers. At 15 months, he went on cyclosporine, a powerful immunosuppressant usually given to organ-transplant patients. It cleared him up, but the drug comes with potentially dangerous side effects over time. Doctors, Sullivan recalls, were “just appalled that my child would be on this amount of medicine at this age”—but his eczema came roaring back as soon as he went off it.<br><br> When a new eczema drug called Dupixent finally became available to Sawyer a few years ago, his turnaround was fast and dramatic. Within a week, his itchiness and redness started calming down. He felt and looked better. The condition that had dominated their lives began to fade into the background.<br><br> Doctors who treat severe eczema now speak of pre- and post-Dupixent eras: “It changed the landscape of having eczema forever,” says Brett King, a dermatologist at Yale. Today, a half dozen novel treatments are available for the skin condition, all of which work by quieting the same biological pathway in eczema; dozens more are in clinical trials. Unlike older drugs, these new ones are precisely targeted and in many cases startlingly effective.<br><br> Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is characterized by red, itchy, and inflamed skin. It&#39;s a very common condition, estimated to affect <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nationaleczema.org/research/eczema-facts/">10 percent of Americans</a> . Of those, a large minority suffer from moderate to severe eczema that seeps into everyday life. “Just imagine scratching endlessly,” King says. “You wake up from sleep scratching. Your sheets are bloody in the morning.” The most basic eczema advice is to moisturize, and moisturize often, to protect the barrier of the skin. But scientists now know that eczema&#39;s cause is not in the skin alone. Many patients also have “an over-reactive or overzealous immune system,” says Dawn Davis, a dermatologist at the Mayo Clinic. Their immune cells release chemicals that irritate nerves, causing itch, and even degrade the skin itself.<br><br> Topical steroids, such as over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream, can tamp down the immune reaction that flares in eczema. If these fail, doctors have resorted to more powerful oral steroids, such as prednisone, or other oral immunosuppressants, such as the aforementioned cyclosporine. The drugs can calm eczema, but because they suppress the overall immune system, they also do much more. Prednisone, for example, makes you more <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hopkinsvasculitis.org/vasculitis-treatments/prednisone/">prone to infections</a> as well as bone fractures, high blood pressure, and glaucoma when taken in the long term. Of course, for many people, eczema is a chronic condition that requires long-term treatment. “Prednisone is kind of like carpet bombing,” says Peter Lio, a dermatologist at Northwestern University. It blasts eczema away, but at a cost.<br><br> In contrast, the newer drugs, Lio says, are more like shotguns that target specific parts of the immune system—with less collateral damage. They fall into two broad classes. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nationaleczema.org/blog/biologics-eczema-treatment/">Monoclonal antibodies</a> , such as Dupixent, intercept the immune-signaling molecules that trigger itch and skin inflammation. And then<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nationaleczema.org/blog/jak-inhibitors-research/">JAK inhibitors</a> , which include pills such as Rinvoq and the topical cream Opzelura, scramble the signal after cells have received it. The development of these drugs came after years of research zeroed in on some of the key immune molecules dysregulated in eczema. But serendipity played a role too: The first such drugs were originally developed for other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis—only to be repurposed when researchers realized that they targeted the very pathways involved in eczema. The breakthroughs in eczema treatment, in fact, are part of a broader revolution in treating inflammatory disorders; both classes of new drugs are now used to tune the immune system in a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24037835/">whole host of</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9146299/">different conditions</a> .<br><br> The monoclonal antibodies and oral JAK inhibitors may have their own serious side effects, such as blood clots, which, Lio says, give some doctors unfamiliar with the new drugs—especially the latter type—pause. But the traditional drugs are not great either. “I&#39;m frustrated that a lot of clinicians are very cavalier about prednisone and cyclosporine … They&#39;re like, &#39;Oh, they&#39;re our old friends,&#39;” he told me. “Then they get nervous about JAK inhibitors.” In his mind, the new drugs are simply the better option in terms of safety and efficacy.<br><br> Jonathan Silverberg, a dermatologist at George Washington University who specializes in eczema, says he now rarely uses the old oral steroids and immunosuppressants. When he does revert to them, it&#39;s not for medical reasons: He ends up prescribing older (that is, generic and therefore cheaper) drugs for uninsured patients who can&#39;t afford the new ones, or for patients who have insurance but are nevertheless denied coverage. “Insurance says, &#39;Can it be fixed with a $10 medicine? Or does it really need the $1,000 tube?&#39;” King told me. Getting patients these newer drugs can mean a lot of time fighting with insurance.<br><br> For now, these drugs have most dramatically improved the lives of patients with moderate to severe eczema—at least those patients who can access them. But doctors told me that topical JAK inhibitors, which are safer than the oral version, could one day be first-line treatments for mild eczema as well. “In a perfect world, I would love it if I never had to prescribe a topical steroid again,” Silverberg said, citing the side effects that come with long-term use. Topical steroids can thin the skin, causing stretch marks, fragility, and poor healing. But at the moment, steroids are also cheap and easily available. They&#39;re not going anywhere as long as the new treatments still come with hefty price tags.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/eczema-treatment-dupixent/674918/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/eczema-treatment-dupixent/674918/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Movie About an Affair That Breaks With Convention]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The queer drama <em>Passages</em> makes poignant observations about power, desire, and the psychological contours of creative life. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ZX6h30As75L-8Q9WRoYqxDhwcBo=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/passages_hr/original.jpg" alt="电影《过往》剧照" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> SBS Productions</figcaption></figure> The protagonist of <em>Passages</em> , an incisive new romantic drama from the director Ira Sachs, is a man obsessed with perfecting others&#39; movements, even as he struggles to control his own. The story opens on a Paris film set, where a director named Tomas (played by Franz Rogowski) critiques an actor&#39;s stiff entrance into a party scene. “This is just a transition moment, but we are turning it into a huge drama moment, because you&#39;re not able to make some fucking simple steps down the staircase!” Tomas yells, arms motioning up and down the threshold his actor can&#39;t seem to cross with sufficient finesse.<br><br> <em>Passages</em> is filled with similarly stressful snapshots of the tightly wound director, who is no less taxing in his personal life. His recklessness gives rise to the movie&#39;s central tension, which kicks off at the wrap party for Tomas&#39;s apparently exasperating film (also called <em>Passages</em> ). After his husband, Martin (Ben Whishaw), leaves the party, Tomas revels in the attention lavished upon him by a young French woman named Agathe (Adèle Exarchopoulos). The night progresses, and their bodies migrate from the dance floor to a bedroom. The next morning, Tomas bursts through the door of the apartment he shares with Martin, waiting all of two minutes to announce: “I had sex with a woman. Can I tell you about it, please?” Weary of his husband&#39;s destructive searches for postproduction catharsis, Martin withdraws from the conversation.<br><br> A different kind of film might have focused on this rupture between the two spouses, using the director&#39;s infidelity to plumb their respective and shared emotional landscapes. <em>Passages</em> does broach this territory, but the film is more of a character study of Tomas than it is a portrait of his relationship with Martin or his affair with Agathe. It&#39;s no tortured-artist hagiography, though: Agathe is originally enthralled by his artistry, but the quality of Tomas&#39;s oeuvre ends up being nearly irrelevant to who he is, both in her estimation and in the film&#39;s. Unrelenting and frank, <em>Passages</em> captures the creeping discontents of its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/culture/ian-penman-rainer-fassbinder/">Fassbinder</a> -lite protagonist without losing sight of how his transgressions affect those around him. He may be magnetic, but Tomas is also unquestionably egotistical, brash, shortsighted, and <em>mean</em> . With a sparse visual sensibility and sharp dialogue, the film surveys the interpersonal damage wrought by Tomas&#39;s carelessness, making poignant observations about power, desire, and the psychological contours of creative life.<br><br> Sachs, a veteran independent filmmaker who also directed the family sagas <em>Frankie</em> and <em>Little Men</em> , is particularly attuned to the cris-crossing complexities of relationships. ( <em>Passages</em> was co-written by Sachs, who is American, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/12/question-of-sex-in-love-is-strange.html">his frequent collaborator</a> , the Brazilian screenwriter Mauricio Zacharias; additional dialogue is credited to the French screenwriter Arlette Langmann.) The characters in <em>Passages</em> circle one another constantly: Before Agathe and Tomas&#39;s catalytic dance-floor encounter, it&#39;s Martin who first approaches her at the bar, after watching her have a conversation with the man she came to the party with, whom she ends up rejecting. “Sorry to intrude,” Martin says in Anglophone-sounding French, when Agathe looks confused by his attentiveness. “I thought maybe you wanted to talk to someone.” As Agathe&#39;s affair with Tomas unfolds, Martin never antagonizes her, and the film transcends familiar love-triangle clichés in part because the characters don&#39;t blame one another for the wounds Tomas inflicts.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/10/frankie-review-isabelle-huppert-marisa-tomei/600673/">Read: <em>Frankie</em> is a moody meditation on mortality</a><br><br> <em>Passages</em> indulges in the pleasure and tyranny of all its main subjects—foremost Tomas, but also its more abstract concerns: the intertwined pursuits of art, love, sex, and belonging. Tomas&#39;s affair with Agathe spurs Martin&#39;s interest in a writer named Amad (Erwan Kepoa Falé), whose novel becomes a symbol of the chasm between the two husbands. When Agathe tells Tomas that she found the book and the author both “very original,” the comment briefly destabilizes their union too. Tomas is troubled that she admires another talented man; the fact that Amad lives in Agathe&#39;s literary imagination is as disturbing as his physical relationship with Martin.<br><br> As Rogowski plays him, the fiercely needy Tomas vibrates with anxiety even as he projects a self-assured image. Throughout the film, he is seemingly incapable of stillness, ping-ponging across the city on his bicycle, flitting from one lover&#39;s house to the other&#39;s, popping up unannounced at either&#39;s workplace. <em>Passages</em> contrasts his live-wire persona with the steadiness of his two lovers, whom Whishaw and Exarchopoulos play with quiet, masterly resolve. Tomas lays his insecurities at their feet, asking Martin to soothe the sting he feels from Agathe&#39;s judgments, and vice versa.<br><br> The only time Tomas is at ease, it seems, is when he&#39;s having sex. Refreshingly, Tomas, though prone to navel-gazing, doesn&#39;t lament any perceived confusion about his sexuality or what labels he ought to use. (This is, perhaps, partly a function of the film&#39;s multicultural Parisian setting and the attendant fluidity in language.) The closest he comes to a crisis of identity is more a crisis of cultural norms: After disastrously fumbling his first meeting with Agathe&#39;s parents, Tomas runs back to Martin, admitting to his estranged husband that he misses being with men. The tearful confession doesn&#39;t register as a comment on Tomas&#39;s sexual preferences but rather an expression of how suffocated he feels by the social expectations placed on him as a man who appears to be in a heterosexual relationship.<br><br> Sachs excels at choreographing all manner of intimacies. Scenes such as that ill-fated meeting with Agathe&#39;s parents reveal as much about his characters&#39; relationships as the film&#39;s sex scenes, which have made it <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/passages-nc-17-rating-queer-movies_n_64c3f4cee4b03ad2b8983471">the latest in a long line of queer dramas</a> to be given an NC-17 rating. (One of the others, the director Abdellatif Kechiche&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vulture.com/2013/10/timeline-blue-is-the-warmest-color-controversy.html">troubled</a> 2013 romance, <em>Blue Is the Warmest Color</em> , also stars Exarchopoulos.) The sex in <em>Passages</em> is indeed stark—nearly wordless, hardly silent. But the beds in the film aren&#39;t just loci of connection, illicit or otherwise. They&#39;re also excavation sites, the minefields where characters unearth tensions between one another and within themselves. They&#39;re reminders, above all, of how a relationship must change when one person refuses to.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/passages-movie-review/674910/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/passages-movie-review/674910/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Putting Trump on the Couch]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A new novel from the psychiatrist famous for <em>Listening to Prozac</em> imagines a Trumplike president&#39;s sessions with a shrink. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Ds_1-zELqwfmv6K_zr6zy5CXAmc=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/trump_therapy/original.jpg" alt="唐纳德·特朗普乘坐教练" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic.资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">, Monday through Friday.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small><br><br> In 1973, the American Psychiatric Association established the so-called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/goldwater-rule">Goldwater Rule</a> as a response to the many mental-health professionals who had ventured glib and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psychnews.psychiatryonline.org/doi/full/10.1176/appi.pn.2016.9a19">florid diagnoses</a> of Senator Barry Goldwater during his 1964 presidential campaign. “I believe Goldwater has the same pathological makeup as Hitler, Castro, Stalin, and other known schizophrenic leaders” was a representative comment; many other psychiatrists and psychologists deemed him schizophrenic, a “megalomaniac,” and “chronically psychotic.” In the four decades between its enshrining and the 2016 election, the Goldwater Rule—which prohibits psychiatrists from issuing diagnoses of public figures they haven&#39;t seen as patients—was mostly honored.<br><br> But from the earliest moments of Donald Trump&#39;s campaign, his behavior, falling far outside the boundaries of conventional candidate comportment, raised the question of whether he could be adequately assessed in purely political terms. Where did politics end and psychology—or psychopathology—begin? Thus the Trump years have inevitably given rise to the routine flouting of the Goldwater Rule, most notably in a collection of writings assembled by the former Yale psychiatrist Bandy Lee, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-dangerous-case-of-donald-trump-37-psychiatrists-and-mental-health-experts-assess-a-president---updated-and-expanded-with-new-essays-bandy-x-lee/9781250212863?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump: 37 Psychiatrists and Mental Health Experts Assess a President</i></a> . (Lee subsequently <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/12/the-yale-professor-fired-for-tweeting-about-alan-dershowitz.html">got fired from Yale</a> for publicly arguing that Alan Dershowitz was suffering from a “shared psychosis” with Trump.)<br><br> Now, with Trump the Republican 2024 front-runner—his accumulating indictments notwithstanding—the psychiatrist Peter D. Kramer seems to have successfully engineered an end run around the Goldwater Rule: In his interesting and challenging new novel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/death-of-the-great-man-peter-d-kramer/9781637587966?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Death of the Great Man</i></a> , Kramer takes on some of the relevant psychological issues of the Trump era via fiction.<br><br> Kramer, the longtime Brown University medical-school professor who became internationally famous 30 years ago for writing the best-selling <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/listening-to-prozac-a-psychiatrist-explores-antidepressant-drugs-and-the-remaking-of-the-self-revised-edition-peter-d-kramer/9780140266719?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Listening to Prozac</i></a> , helped transform how we think about psychopharmacology and the self. In this novel, he confronts his protagonist, an idealistic psychiatrist named Henry Farber who shares much of Kramer&#39;s biography, with the question of how and whether to provide psychotherapy to an American president who shares much of Trump&#39;s biography.<br><br> Kramer is at pains to emphasize that he doesn&#39;t intend a one-to-one correlation between his fictional president, who is referred to only as the “Great Man,” and the real-life Trump. Yet in his general behavior (he&#39;s an erratic and autocratic populist who has shredded democratic norms) and many details (he has an attractive, younger European wife, and has refused to accept defeat in his reelection campaign, which took place amid the depredations of a global pandemic), the Great Man is unmistakably Trumpian.<br><br> The Great Man is also—we learn in the novel&#39;s third sentence—dead, almost certainly murdered; his body was discovered on the couch in Farber&#39;s consulting room in Providence, Rhode Island. The novel flashes back (how did the president come to be in Farber&#39;s office?) and forward (who killed the Great Man? Will Farber get fingered for it?), but it is not a classic whodunit, because Kramer heavily seasons the mystery with stylistic elements drawn from literary fiction and political satire, which allows for both comedy and commentary. For instance, Kramer depicts the Great Man&#39;s wife, Náomi, who on the surface seems much like Melania Trump, as a literary intellectual and former dramaturge with liberal leanings and an interest in existential philosophy. So nauseated is Náomi by the moral (and literal) stench of her husband that she routinely retches when he&#39;s nearby. She also turns out to have been the secret instigator of the effort to recruit a therapist for the Great Man. She may also be his murderer.<br><br> I interviewed Kramer on Zoom earlier this summer. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.<br><br> <b>Scott Stossel:</b> What inspired this novel?<br><br> <b>Peter D. Kramer:</b> This was an epiphany. It was December of 2016, and Trump had just been elected. I was in New York, consulting on clinical cases at Cornell medical school. One of my editors had a short amount of time for me at the end of the day, and so I went to Union Square, near my publisher&#39;s offices, a little early. It was rainy, so I went into the Barnes &amp; Noble to look for books for my grandsons. I was on the escalator and the book just came to me: I thought I should write a novel that relates to Trump. The framework came to me almost whole. I went into a little corner in the children&#39;s books section and started writing notes on my phone.<br><br> And then I went in and presented my idea to the editor, and he said: “Absolutely not.” And I thought, well, this is what I have to write, and I sat down to write it anyway.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/07/a-crack-in-psychoanalytic-standards-courtesy-of-the-president/534825/">Read: Evaluating Trump&#39;s psyche in public</a><br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> What was the editor&#39;s objection?  Fear of political blowback or just “this isn&#39;t gonna sell”?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I knew from the start that this book was going to begin with a toxic populist US president dead on a psychiatrist&#39;s couch—and of course if Trump had died at some point in between the writing of the book and its publication, that wouldn&#39;t have been amusing.<br><br> This editor had another reasonable objection, which is that assassination for regime change is an illiberal expedient. It&#39;s not amusing. You can&#39;t kill off presidents—it&#39;s just morally not the right thing. But in the novel, this <i>isn&#39;t</i> murder for regime change; every character around him has a reason to want the Great Man dead. And these reasons are really only incidentally political. He&#39;s just so horrible to everyone, and so many people have their own motives for killing him.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> How close did you mean to make the Great Man to Trump? Did you start with the public Trump we all see on TV and try to imagine his inner life?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> The thinking began with Trump, but of course characters take on their own lives for the writer. I am not an expert on politics or history, so I focused on what Trump would look like to a psychotherapist. That meant I had to create what I didn&#39;t know about, which is this intimate person: How does he treat his wife? How does he treat people around him? How would he do in therapy? And I was running into this other constraint, which is that psychiatrists are not supposed to diagnose public figures from a distance. I didn&#39;t want to violate the Goldwater Rule by saying, “Oh, this is fiction” and then depicting Trump exactly. I wanted, instead, to play with the question of what psychiatrists would do if they could really get close to a Trump figure.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> The reader&#39;s mind inevitably goes to Trump because the Great Man behaves in very Trumplike ways and has a very Trumplike biography.<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> My model was the dictator fiction that&#39;s common in Latin America. In <i>The Autumn of the Patriarch</i> , Gabriel García Márquez takes a particular dictator, Gustavo Pinilla of Colombia, and adds elements of General Franco of Spain and Juan Vicente Gómez of Venezuela, and creates this outrageous version of a dictator. Márquez has him basically governing the country from the grave. So that gave me, I thought, license to create a comic character who was outrageous in certain ways. Whether he&#39;s more outrageous than Trump, I can&#39;t say. But he&#39;s outrageous in his own way, and specifically Trumplike in five or six other ways.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Let&#39;s talk about the Goldwater Rule. Don&#39;t mental-health professionals have a “duty to warn” when somebody poses a danger to themselves or others? And what if that danger posed is not to an individual but to the entire American population, which is clearly how some of the experts in the Lee book see Trump?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> The real function of the Goldwater Rule is to protect psychiatry from itself—from all these doctors expressing their <i>political</i> views through making diagnoses without a careful respect for the clinical facts. I remember an era when—this is way back—people would say, “Well, if your patient has not expressed anxiety about the atom bomb, the patient is in denial.” And I thought, <i>My patients will express whatever they express, and the introduction of uniform political views into psychiatry is a disaster</i> . I&#39;ve had patients who were very much on the front lines of the anti-abortion movement, and I am very much on the other side. But you are out to treat the patient who&#39;s in front of you—you&#39;re not out to impose your views or ask them to see things differently than they do.<br><br> You just need to deal with patients as you find them—even with patients who are racist and prejudiced and anti-Semitic or whatever. To create some kind of internal rule in psychotherapy that integrates political views is a disaster.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Let&#39;s say you have a patient referred to you with depression, and he quickly evinces extreme racist and misogynistic views, and election denialism. What would that encounter in the consulting room look like?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> This is very much one of the topics of the book. One of the worries regarding Henry Farber is that he will go and treat the Great Man, and that will just give the Great Man some ease, and make him better able to do the terrible things he does. Farber has great faith in his therapeutic method, so the setup is this: He&#39;s known—as I am—for writing a book early in his career that was a best seller, and he&#39;s also known as a sleep doctor. Later in life he&#39;s specialized in the treatment of paranoid men. And he&#39;s brought in to treat the Great Man&#39;s insomnia, but secretly there&#39;s some hope on the part of the people who bring him in that he will treat the personality problems as well. And I think Farber is comfortable with what seems like a corrupt assignment, because he just believes in his therapeutic method, which is that if he sits empathetically beside his patient—metaphorically speaking—and looks out at the world as his patient does, and gets the patient to feel what he feels and be aware of his feelings, good things will happen, that there will be some general liberation, and that will be useful both for his sleep problems and his disordered personality. But he&#39;s not trying to nudge the person in any direction; he&#39;s trying to get the person to free himself of whatever it is that constrains his feeling and thinking.<br><br> Farber&#39;s extreme commitment to this approach is comic. When the Great Man throws him into a jail cell at one point, Farber thinks, <i>How can I utilize this thing that my patient has done? The patient will indirectly notice how I behave in the jail cell, and maybe I can do that in a way that&#39;s therapeutic; I&#39;ll prepare for our next encounter by reviewing similar cases</i> . I don&#39;t know that I am self-abnegating in that way. But I do retain an idealistic faith in the therapeutic method that if you put people in touch with themselves—that&#39;s your job, and your job isn&#39;t to guide the direction of progress.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Let&#39;s say, as implausible as this is, Ivanka calls you up and says, “My father is suffering from grave depression after his brush with COVID mortality”—would you do as Farber does and take Trump on as a patient?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I would take the case in a minute. I think Farber cross-examines this stuff: Is he taking the case because this will demonstrate that he&#39;s a virtuoso of empathy, or out of his own self-aggrandizement because this is such a challenging case? I do think I would be tempted by the level of effort that would be required. I like taking on cases that I thought were difficult for me because they were unlikeable patients. (Anyone who&#39;s my patient: That wasn&#39;t you!) I do think the book is my attempt to imagine what the level of effort would be like. Farber keeps looking for the element of full humanity in his patient. When he perceives this little spark of it, he&#39;s so encouraged by it; he thinks there&#39;s something here he can work with. I think that would be a challenge with someone like Trump: sort of waiting him out until you see that little hint of something that&#39;s not propaganda and self-praise but something that has a little texture and dimensionality to it. I mean, I was really trying to imagine what that would look like for Trump.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> And what would that look like?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I think it could be exposure of vulnerability. Could just be genuine emotion. There are easy emotions like anger, which is sort of the lowest-level emotion; patients who can&#39;t access much else can often access rage. But there are other moments where I imagine under all the grievance there could be some genuine pain or sadness, and you&#39;re curious about that.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Imagine Trump meeting with a child psychiatrist when he was a younger person. Do you think this would help him process whatever the trauma of growing up with his father was?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I think it&#39;s at least possible to think that this grudge against the world, the constant sense of having been wronged, could have been diminished. That&#39;s what psychiatry that examines early-childhood injuries is out to do—free people from being in the thrall of their resentment for the rest of their lives.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Allen Frances, the psychiatrist who presided over the composition of the <i>DSM-4</i> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.harperacademic.com/book/9780062394521/twilight-of-american-sanity/">has written</a> that Trump&#39;s presidency and aberrant behavior are more symptoms of culture that&#39;s gone mad than of any psychiatric illness. And Jeffrey Lieberman, a psychiatrist at Columbia, has written that Trump doesn&#39;t have any <i>DSM</i> illness—he&#39;s just “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/opinion/trump-mentally-ill.html">a jerk</a> .” Do you think there are links between various personality types and certain political ideologies or behaviors?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> I know Jeff and Allen a little bit, and I don&#39;t agree with the argument “Well, this is just evil, and diagnosis has nothing to do with it.” Diagnosis aside, I think what we saw was four years of a certain kind of personality on display. And it was almost impossible to be a political analyst without wondering about certain of his actions; there wasn&#39;t enough logic in the behavior to explain it only in political terms. In the book, I write about “arbitocracy.” This isn&#39;t really authoritarianism, because it&#39;s not consistent enough, or organized well enough—not that authoritarian regimes generally are either—but this seemed to be even more arbitrary and herky-jerky. So, yes, I think personality is relevant in talking about the politics of Trump.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> I know you don&#39;t want to diagnose Trump. But having sat, as Henry Farber, in therapy sessions with the imaginary Great Man, what would you diagnose Great Man with? If he&#39;s gonna file an insurance claim, that requires your giving him a <i>DSM</i> diagnosis, right?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/donald-trump-not-well/597640/">Read: Trump is not well</a><br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> Right. I&#39;m with Farber, who says that the men in his paranoid-men&#39;s group do not meet a strict by-the-book definition of paranoia; they&#39;re people who have this same kind of hypervigilant posture in the world. And he says of the Great Man, “Yes, he would qualify as one of my patients.” So it&#39;s sort of a loose paranoia for the Great Man.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Is paranoia a <i>DSM</i> disorder?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> It&#39;s a delusional disorder, which is in the <i>DSM</i> . And of course I diagnosed patients in my practice for the purpose of deciding which medicine to use, and for insurance claims. I think diagnosis is very helpful. But personality disorders—that is, borderline personality, sociopathy, or paranoia, the kinds of diagnoses that were debated with regard to Trump—were never something where I&#39;ve found the particulars that useful. Patients don&#39;t necessarily stick with one personality-disorder diagnosis—they can have one and a year later have another, or the diagnosis can even disappear, and they end up with just depression or drug abuse or something, and don&#39;t have the personality disorder. It&#39;s not a very stable diagnosis.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> Are personality disorders susceptible to treatment by medication? If you were treating Trump—or, if you prefer, if Farber is treating the Great Man—is there a drug regimen that could ease their distress or make them less inclined to wreak pain and havoc on everyone around them?<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> Well, the experience of treating personality disorder with medication has not been terrific. There certainly was a lot of use of SSRIs in treating borderline personality disorder, with some success and a lot of failure. I think the results were similar for lithium. In <i>Listening to Prozac</i> , I talk a lot about rejection sensitivity, a category that isn&#39;t written about a lot anymore. And people had this diagnosis of rejection sensitive dysphoria, which sometimes did well on antidepressants. It turned out that really what was going on was that their vulnerability to social insult was so great that they looked very erratic, and on medication they could be less erratic and less in pain.<br><br> But as a therapist looking at the relationship between Henry Farber and the Great Man, I wasn&#39;t tempted for Farber to reach for the prescription pad. I did not want to introduce medication to the book.<br><br> <b>Stossel:</b> You can&#39;t medicate a politician into making better policy.<br><br> <b>Kramer:</b> Yeah. I mean, I think if you got up close to one of these political figures and saw that he had ADHD, maybe a stimulant would be calming in a paradoxical way. Or if the person really is manic, maybe lithium would be helpful. You can imagine some diagnosis that can&#39;t be made from a distance but here up close you might see something that was not as evident in these speeches and debates. Medication could possibly help with those.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 11:46:13 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/trump-goldwater-rule-death-of-the-great-man-book-review/674919/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/trump-goldwater-rule-death-of-the-great-man-book-review/674919/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[A Strike Scripted by Netflix]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The writers are trying to roll back changes that the streaming service already made a new normal. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OdOBGYA-jTWgab_GUzAvPiikQHM=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/NetflixShrinkingWritersRoom/original.png" alt="巨手使用小型打字机的插图。" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> The Atlantic / Getty</figcaption></figure> Three months into the Hollywood writers&#39; strike, there is at last some sign of movement. When the writers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/hollywood-writers-slam-execs-wga-strike-1235476552/">walked off the job</a> on May 2, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (the organization representing the studios) ended negotiations, and no talks have happened in the 14 weeks since. But on Tuesday, the AMPTP <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/08/studios-seek-to-reopen-talks-with-wga-on-friday-1235452931/">informed</a> the Writers Guild of America that it wanted to meet “to discuss negotiations,” as the guild told its members. That meeting is supposed to happen today.<br><br> What the AMPTP ( <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywood-writers-actor-guild-strike/674848/">which is also dealing with</a> an actors&#39; strike) will have to say is anyone&#39;s guess, but we know what the two sides will ultimately be arguing about: streaming. Because, at heart, this is a clash over the way streaming has changed the movies and, more important, television.<br><br> Writers, for instance, want to enjoy a share of the upside when streaming shows become hits, just as they once enjoyed sizable residuals—a continuing share of revenue from rights when broadcast shows they wrote went into syndication. (At the moment, writers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/hollywood-strikes-streaming-residuals-fight-actors-writers-1235448649/">get small residual payments</a> for streaming shows but reap no additional benefit if a show becomes a huge hit.) But that would require streamers to provide viewership data for their shows—information they would prefer to keep to themselves.<br><br> When studios hire a showrunner to develop a show, the WGA <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://deadline.com/2023/06/taylor-sheridan-wga-staffing-demands-kevin-costner-yellowstone-1235422063/">wants a minimum number</a> of writers hired for the “pre-greenlight room,” where scripts are nowadays routinely written before a show is officially picked up. And, perhaps above all, the union wants studios to return to creating bigger writers&#39; rooms when shows are in production. That would involve adopting minimum-staffing requirements and abandoning the decade-long trend toward <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/features/mini-rooms-writers-tv-pilot-series-orders-1235061733/">so-called mini rooms</a> .<br><br> These may seem like wonky issues, but they boil down to a simple idea. The writers are trying to reclaim the ground they&#39;ve lost because of the ascent of one company: Netflix.<br><br> We&#39;re all used to the idea that Netflix has changed the way TV is <i>consumed</i> . But it has also changed the way TV is <i>produced</i> .<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywoods-cruel-strategy/674730/">Xochitl Gonzalez: The businessmen broke Hollywood</a><br><br> Netflix&#39;s seasons are shorter—not just shorter than the traditional 22-to-24-episode seasons common on broadcast TV, but shorter even than the 12-to-13-episode seasons that used to be standard on pay-cable networks such as HBO. Netflix habitually pays more for its productions up front, but because it did away with the syndication model and keeps its viewership data to itself, it has also limited the upside for writers.<br><br> Most important, at least as far as the strike goes, Netflix ignores the social norms that had long governed TV production: It has generally done away with big writers&#39; rooms, replacing them with mini rooms. As the name suggests, mini rooms (which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/writers-guild-contract-negotiation-mini-room-1235568173/">were pioneered</a> by AMC but have now become widespread in the industry) have fewer writers. Whereas in the past, a typical TV show might have had 10 to 12 writers, mini rooms might have only three or four.<br><br> But the changes go beyond that. In traditional writers&#39; rooms, which still exist on some TV shows, writers are paid through the actual production of the show. Individual writers commonly also act as the show&#39;s producer on specific episodes, and even junior writers get the chance to learn the ins and outs of making TV: They are on set while shows are filmed, and they work with showrunners on editing and post-production. In effect, writers&#39; rooms are not just about writing scripts. They are also about training the next generation of writers to make and run their own shows in the future.<br><br> A mini room is very different. Writers&#39; tenures are shorter, and their job scope is narrowed: They&#39;re there purely to write, or in some cases just buff, scripts. The opportunities to learn other aspects of show production have mostly vanished.<br><br> Writers&#39; rooms, in fact, were never written into any WGA contract, seemingly based on an assumption that business would continue as usual. But Netflix, perhaps because it was coming from outside the industry, had no interest in business as usual. So it discarded the old norms. And as other studios tried to keep up with Netflix, they did the same.<br><br> One result is that despite an explosion in the number of TV series being produced (and therefore an increase in the number of people writing for television), the amount of money going to writers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2023-03-14/writers-guild-compensation-report-shows-writer-pay-depressed-over-last-decade">has not really risen</a> in recent years. On top of that, shows employ fewer writers, and writers now get a lot less hands-on experience.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/writers-strike-hollywood-wga-union-streaming-platforms/674056/">Gavin Mueller: The Luddites of Hollywood</a><br><br> So the WGA wants to bring back the writers&#39; room. The guild&#39;s contract proposals include minimum-staffing requirements (one writer per episode, plus another writer for every two episodes after six, up to a maximum of 12 writers) and a demand that not less than half of the writers stay employed throughout the production of the show, with at least one writer staying through post-production. This, the WGA argues, wouldn&#39;t just be good for writers; it&#39;d also be good for the industry as a whole, because it would encourage the steady production of new showrunning talent.<br><br> That&#39;s not wrong. But the problem for the writers should be obvious: Netflix <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbr.com/netflix-only-profitable-streaming-service/">is the only streaming company</a> that&#39;s earning substantial profits from its business. (In fact, Netflix and, to a lesser extent, Hulu are the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/whos-winning-the-streaming-wars-revenue-subscribers-netflix-disney-1234813738/">only two major streaming companies</a> that are profitable at all.) That&#39;s in part because streamers are investing heavily up front to build content libraries and acquire subscribers. Even so, Netflix&#39;s stock <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2023/07/17/netflix-stock-hits-17-month-high-as-analysts-forecast-competitive-advantage-from-hollywood-strike/?sh=3aa69238248b">has the highest valuation</a> and the highest price-to-earnings multiple in the industry. The company has become a bellwether for the studios, the model that everyone else—explicitly or implicitly—is trying to copy. Accordingly, to convince Netflix that it should stop making shows the way it&#39;s been making them, and to convince the other studios that they should not emulate Netflix, will be a challenging task.<br><br> That&#39;s especially so because the writers are trying to roll back changes that have already happened—with results that Netflix and its investors are pretty satisfied with. (If the writers had written minimum-staffing requirements into their contracts in, say, 2007, and the studios were only now trying to get rid of writers&#39; rooms, the dynamic would be very different.) And although it&#39;s true that the disappearance of writers&#39; rooms will probably hurt the quality of new shows in the future, that&#39;s an industry-wide issue. Even if the studios collectively benefit from young writers getting broader on-the-job training, any individual company would prefer that everyone else pays for that training, which it could then get a free ride on.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/hollywood-writers-actor-guild-strike/674848/">Sonny Bunch: Why the studios are risking everything</a><br><br> The issue is not that going back to bigger writers&#39; rooms would actually cost that much money—the amount studios spend on writers is a tiny fraction of their overall budget. It&#39;s that the practice runs counter to the optimizing, efficiency-maximizing ethos that Netflix brought to the industry. And that same conflict is at the heart of another battle between the writers and the studios, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/writers-strike-amptp-negotiations-issues-ai-1235479953/">this one over AI</a> : The WGA has proposed rules barring AI from writing or rewriting literary materials, or being used as source material; the studios <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/2023/05/09/hollywood-writers-strike-2023-ai">have said only that</a> they&#39;ll commit to holding annual conversations about technological advances.<br><br> As far as we know, no studio is yet using AI in place of human writers, and at present, any attempt to do so seems unlikely to result in a good script. But the writers can foresee, and are trying to forestall, the day when efficiency-hungry studios will use AI to generate rough drafts that writers will then be asked to polish. As with mini rooms, that wouldn&#39;t be ideal for creativity or quality, but it would certainly be more efficient.<br><br> Thinking about the kind of deal the studios and the WGA might eventually reach, it&#39;s easier to imagine the studios compromising on AI than getting rid of mini rooms. The WGA may be able to keep robots from writing scripts in the future; much less clear is whether they&#39;ll be able to win a deal for more humans to write them.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 11:36:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/hollywood-writers-strike-netflix-studios/674913/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/hollywood-writers-strike-netflix-studios/674913/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[What Happens When a Carnival Barker Writes Intellectual History]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Christopher Rufo doesn&#39;t understand that radicals and nutjobs make universities great. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/TCj_IagmmJBDkq4dp2LzYKvhdwE=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/chris_rufo_theory_hr/original.jpg" alt="安吉拉·戴维斯和克里斯·鲁福的插图" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by The Atlantic.

Rufo is what is sometimes known as a shit-stirrer—a particular type of troublemaker whose game is to find something stinky, then waft its fumes toward the noses of those mostly likely to be outraged by it. In the past several years, controversies over race, gender, and campus leftism have ripened in part due to his publicity. Often the so-called antiracists, trans activists, and tenured radicals at the center of the controversies are self-discrediting. All Rufo has to do is quote them or post their videos on his Twitter feed—a teacher fanatically devoted to a trendy form of social justice, say, or someone preening about their identity. Even those who find their behavior outrageous often find Rufo&#39;s tactics distasteful as well. (Many of his targets strike me as mentally unbalanced.) But the thing about shit-stirrers is that even if they are distasteful or loathsome, they&#39;d be out of work if there were not already raw material to stir.<br><br> Rufo&#39;s new book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/america-s-cultural-revolution-how-the-radical-left-conquered-everything-christopher-f-rufo/9780063227538?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>America&#39;s Cultural Revolution</em></a> , is in this context surprisingly hygienic. It is not about the raw material but about the manufacturers of the porcelain vessels in which it is found. He curates a gallery of activists, academics, and Communists active in the mid- and late 20th century, and he describes how their ideas slowly took over campuses, HR departments, and leftist political circles. These figures are well known, and it is ethically refreshing to see him focus his revilement on public figures in full command of their rhetoric and ideas, rather than on possibly disturbed nobodies.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/christopher-rufo-manhattan-institute/673008/">Graeme Wood: DEI is an ideological test</a><br><br> Even more unexpected are his points of agreement with his enemies. The people Rufo names as intellectual progenitors of wokeness are in fact the same ones the most literate postliberal leftists would name: the German philosopher Herbert Marcuse, his American student Angela Davis, the educational theorist Paulo Freire, and founders of critical race theory (CRT) such as the Harvard Law professor Derrick Bell, all perennial entrants in what Jonathan Yardley once called the “America Sucks Sweepstakes.” (The most noteworthy omission is Michel Foucault.) These figures argued that the basic values of liberalism—freedom, equality, justice—are lies, and the systems and institutions that tout them are incorrigibly complicit in evil. To be “woke” is simply to be roused from the naive and dogmatic slumber in which one might dream that these lies were true. The remedy is cynical and radical: Stop believing the lies, and destroy the political and social systems that tell them.<br><br> Your appreciation of this book will depend in part on whether you prefer Rufo the carnival barker, luring in members of the public to see the lefty freakshow he curates, or Rufo the intellectual historian. The first is more fun but the second is just as biased. His description of the careers of these intellectual figures is meant for readers who know nothing of their work, and do not care to learn about it from a sympathetic source. The narrative is meant to build them up only to villainize them—and this is not difficult. Like Rufo&#39;s TikTok freaks, his woke progenitors often said and did things that need no additional commentary to make them into villains.<br><br> Marcuse said he was “honored” to be associated with Mao, who was then in the midst of killing tens of millions of people. Davis, in a famous moment of candor quoted by Rufo, once said that political prisoners behind the Iron Curtain “deserve what they get.” (Prison abolition, one of Davis&#39;s causes, evidently did not extend to the Gulag.) In 1970, Davis bought a shotgun that was used two days later to blow the head off a California judge. Paulo Freire called Mao&#39;s Cultural Revolution “the most genial solution of the century,” a line that sounds, when applied to mass starvation, straight from the mouth of Lex Luthor.<br><br> Rufo, a recent appointee of Governor Ron DeSantis to the board of New College of Florida, hates all of these people, but he is plainly fascinated by their ability to achieve political traction for their bad ideas. Take Freire, a Brazilian crackpot who taught that the path to peasant education was through Maoist class suicide. His contribution to human well-being was almost certainly a net negative—yet his book <em>Pedagogy of the Oppressed</em> is taught in every education school in America. “History should have reduced [it] to an ideological curiosity,” Rufo writes, with what I think is grudging admiration. He quotes Marcuse saying that the way to convert his ideas into political action is to abandon direct activism and instead infiltrate institutions, to take over universities and bureaucracies, and to initiate a silent revolution that ends in a radical victory before any of the old guard is aware of what happened.<br><br> The case of CRT is particularly striking in Rufo&#39;s account. Rufo has made a bogeyman out of CRT, but it is real, radical, and influential beyond its origins in legal academia. CRT holds that white supremacy is systemic, insidious, and embedded in supposedly neutral liberal norms like color-blindness and freedom of speech. Derrick Bell argued that white supremacy is ineradicable, and that racial progress is just a veneer over a permanently rotten system. The norms and orthodoxies of a rotten system are owed no deference, because they are in fact part of the rot. Among the norms in legal academia that Bell broke was the format of the journal article, which later in life he eschewed in favor of short, didactic fiction, including a science-fiction story about white Americans selling Black people to aliens.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/ron-desantis-florida-critical-race-theory-professors/672507/">Daniel Golden: &#39;It&#39;s making us more ignorant&#39;</a><br><br> Rufo notes that these theories were widely critiqued even as they were proposed. He cites a potent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newrepublic.com/article/149558/let-talk">dissent</a> from the literary critic and historian Henry Louis Gates Jr., who warned against CRT&#39;s unnerving calls to expand state power, in a manner “incompatible with democracy.” Its theorists&#39; aim was “not to resist power, but to enlist power.” When Randall Kennedy, a fellow Black legal academic, drafted another dissent, Rufo writes, “Bell personally intervened” to persuade Kennedy not to publish his critique. Kennedy published it anyway, leading Bell to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/26/opinion/l-shed-light-in-all-corners-of-academic-tenure-harvard-law-furor-974290.html">suggest</a> that he was auditioning to be an “academic minstrel” and professional race traitor. Kennedy&#39;s 2019 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3350497">essay</a> assessing Bell&#39;s legacy is revealing. He contrasts Bell&#39;s “certitude” with his own self-doubt, and he notes Bell&#39;s disregard for teaching students already motivated by racial justice “to understand and take seriously perspectives at odds with those that they embraced.” Kennedy says he attempts to teach these perspectives in courses about race; Bell considered this “a betrayal.”<br><br> Rufo is more interested in exhibiting these theories than assessing them. In most cases I would agree with him that the assessment should be negative. Freire&#39;s argument that the path to literacy lies through Maoist collectivization; Davis&#39;s belief that policing and imprisonment should be abolished; Bell&#39;s contention that <em>Brown v. Board of Education</em> was wrongly decided and that “separate but [actually] equal” schooling for Blacks and whites would have been better, and that racial progress is a myth—these are all disastrous views, with grave and sometimes morally abhorrent consequences. It&#39;s reasonable to wonder, as Rufo does, how these doctrines came to be taught with so little resistance. He accurately describes the takeover of certain sectors of education as a “long march through the institutions,” a Maoist reference to Marcuse&#39;s suggestion that radicals hunker down in bureaucracies. And it&#39;s worth considering the broken safeguards that allowed this strategy to succeed.<br><br> Rufo nonetheless seems to have little idea what universities are for. This is a significant deficiency, given not only his subject matter in this book but also his position as a university trustee. In this role, Rufo envisions himself as a tribune of the people of Florida, curtailing in their name the influence of leftist professors and administrators whose views they would find objectionable, hateful, or racist. He wants to end political tests that would exclude centrists and conservatives from the faculty. He thinks the solution to the problem is democratic oversight and policing the excesses of the left, in particular by exerting political control over hiring of faculty. I see little sign of a vision for a real intellectual space—which would have to include and even embrace weird or odious speech, especially the kind many Floridians disagree with.<br><br> I would not want Davis or Freire running a Department of Justice or Education. I suspect that if they ran even a Froyo stand it would devolve, as Rufo says of a Weatherman cell, into a fiesta of “hangovers, jealousies, gonorrhea, and lice.” But that does not mean Davis and Freire are unfit for professorships. Universities are <em>precisely</em> the places where society should stash its radicals and nutjobs, and universities function best when some fraction of their faculty is certifiable. Rufo is appalled that the University of California and Harvard employ such people. I am relieved.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/new-college-florida-ron-desantis-takeover/673556/">Conor Friedersdorf: DeSantis chose the wrong college to take over</a><br><br> Consider Davis&#39;s signature intellectual achievement, which is the call to abolish prisons. On this point my view is more in line with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://youtu.be/Txp8B4ek_kk">Richard Pryor&#39;s</a> after six weeks filming in an Arizona prison. Seeing so many Black men removed from their families and communities “made my heart ache,” Pryor said. Listening to those same men describe their murders made him “thank God we have penitentiaries.”<br><br> But the idea of prison abolition is powerful and challenging. (I recommend Tommie Shelby&#39;s recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691229751/the-idea-of-prison-abolition">book</a> on the subject.) Plenty of hitherto common penal practices have been abolished: ear cropping, castration, boiling in oil, amputation. Imprisonment is a corporal punishment that involves the whole body, all at once, and under some theoretical condition, we could imagine a day when it is retired along with those other corporal punishments. Davis saw this before others, and her radicalism forces reconsideration of the most basic ideas about how American society is, and should be, organized. Her ideas (about violence, communism, prison, and much else) are bad, but bad ideas can spawn good ones. And that is one of the ways universities work, by providing spaces where bad ideas proliferate along with good ones. Rufo might retort that the current balance is off, and the bad ideas have driven out the good. But nuking the bad ideas without collateral damage among the good is impossible, and DeSantis&#39;s reforms in Florida look to me like a neutron bomb, more likely to kill off all ideas than just to reduce the bad ones.<br><br> The late novelist Cormac McCarthy was affiliated with the Santa Fe Institute (SFI), an educational and research institution best known for its programs in theoretical physics. He understood the value of having madmen around. In 2015, he drafted a new mission statement for SFI. Its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://sfi-edu.s3.amazonaws.com/sfi-edu/production/uploads/ckeditor/2018/04/24/cormac-sfi.pdf">principles</a> would make better guidance than whatever DeSantis is implementing. “SFI is always pushing creativity to its practical limits. We always court a high risk of failure,” he wrote. “Occasionally we find that an invited guest is insane. This generally cheers us all up. We know we&#39;re on the right track.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 04 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-great-dechurching-who-s-leaving-why-are-they-going-and-what-will-it-take-to-bring-them-back-jim-davis/9780310147435?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>大除教会</i></a>，<i> </i>即将出版的新书分析了两位政治学家对 7,000 多名美国人进行的调查，试图找出为什么近年来有这么多美国人离开教堂。作者发现，宗教滥用和腐败确实在促使参加者离开的过程中发挥了作用，但受访者中更大比例的人表示，他们“出于更平庸的原因”离开了教堂，正如米多尔所说：<br><br><p>这本书指出，驱逐大多数离开者的决定性问题是……21世纪美国人的生活是如何运作的。当代美国根本就不是为了促进相互、关怀或共同生活而设立的。相反，它旨在最大限度地提高职业和财务成功所定义的个人成就。这样的制度给各种形式的社区留下了宝贵的时间和精力，而这些社区对一个人自己的职业生活没有贡献，或者随着年龄的增长，对自己孩子的职业前景没有贡献。</p>正如米多尔指出的，部分问题在于宗教在一些美国人的生活中扮演着不同寻常的角色。 <i>《大西洋月刊》</i>作家德里克·汤普森 (Derek Thompson) 在 2019 年创造了<i>“工作主义”</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/">一词</a>，并诊断自己是一名受其束缚的工人。 “20 世纪初的经济学家没有预见到工作可能会从物质生产手段演变为身份生产手段，”汤普森当时写道。 “他们没有预料到，对于穷人和中产阶级来说，工作仍然是必需品；但对于受过大学教育的精英来说，它将演变成一种宗教，承诺身份、超越和社区。”<br><br>汤普森指出，工作主义并没有兑现这些承诺：“我们的工作从来就不是为了承担信仰的重担，它们在重压下不堪重负。根据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.gallup.com/services/190118/engaged-workplace.aspx">盖洛普 (Gallup) 的</a>调查，高达 87% 的员工没有投入到工作中。这个数字逐年上升。”即便如此，对于那些将工作视为生活指导原则的人来说，其他优先事项可能很快就会被抛在一边。 “对许多人来说，潜在的挑战是他们的生活就像一根即将折断的橡皮筋一样被拉伸，而去教堂最终感觉就像是清单上已经太长的一项，”米多尔写道。<br><br>米多尔认为，问题的核心不仅仅是去教堂，而是美国社会已经变成什么样子：<br><br><p>我们面前的问题并不是我们有一个健康、可持续发展的社会，却没有教会的空间。问题在于，许多美国人所采用的生活方式让我们感到孤独、焦虑，并且不确定如何与其他人一起生活。</p>米多尔的观点让我想起了我们播客<i>《如何与人交谈</i>》中我最喜欢的一<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2023/05/social-infrastructure-public-space-community-relationships/674157/">集</a>，其中主持人讨论了公共空间在建设社区中的作用。咖啡店、教堂和图书馆等场所可以作为真正的共享空间，人们可以在这里交流并结交新朋友。但主持人朱莉·贝克指出，即使在这些地方，“我也观察到……一片喧嚣。”人们“肩负着使命”。她和制片人丽贝卡·拉希德（Rebecca Rashid）所说的“美国效率文化”使得我们没有动力慢慢来，坐下来结识新朋友。贝克与米多的观点相同：许多美国人似乎已经忘记了如何彼此建立真正经过深思熟虑的社区。<br><br>到目前为止，我对美国社区和灵性的未来描绘了一幅相当负面的图画，无论一个人可能遵守什么宗教或习俗。但一种竞争趋势也在悄然兴起：一些美国人正在改写有意或精神生活的规则。正如温迪·卡奇和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/elan-babchuck/">埃兰·巴布查克</a>一月份在<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/us-religious-affiliation-rates-declining/672729/">指出的</a>那样，教堂出席率等指标可能不再是衡量美国宗教信仰的最准确指标。 “虽然对传统宗教场所（教堂、犹太教堂、清真寺、学校等）的参与在下降，但其他地方却出现了生机的迹象：在与牧师的对话中，在网上建立的社区中，最终也形成了面对面的联系，在根植于共同信仰的社会正义团体中，”他们写道。<br><br>米多则在读完<i>《伟大的去教会》</i>后，为教会找到了一种雄心勃勃的方式，让美国人重新回归教会。他认为，也许教会可以通过向成员提出更多要求来更好地为他们的成员服务：<br><br><p>一个充满活力、赋予生命的教会需要其成员更多而不是更少的时间和精力。它要求人们将彼此置于事业之上，将祈祷和阅读经文的时间置于成就之上……教会可以塑造更好、更真实的社区，让饥饿者得到食物，弱者得到鼓舞，骄傲者得到铸造向下。</p>对于任何社区来说，创造一种人们可以互相要求更多、反过来给予更多的环境似乎都是一条明智的经验法则。如果美国的生活没有让这样的前景变得如此令人畏惧就好了。<br><br>

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/us-womens-national-team-soccer-world-cup/674885/">他们正在挣扎</a>。周二，他们在总体表现不佳的情况下勉强与排名第九的葡萄牙队打平，周日他们将面对排名第三的瑞典队的一场充满挑战的比赛。对于粉丝来说，这是令人心碎的事情。 In the past two decades, the team has turned out talented players, scored a victory in the fight for equal pay, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-soccer/674831/">showcased a viable model for girls to become successful athletes</a> .反对他们是很吝啬的，但现在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/08/us-womens-national-team-soccer-world-cup/674885/">可能是时候了</a>。<br><br>尽管美国一直在支持女子足球联赛，但世界各地的球队都在关注这一点。 The UK franchises have started investing in their women&#39;s teams, although to some they may be seen as second-class to the men;s teams.全球各地的女队都在品尝粉丝和合法性的滋味，在这种势头的基础上，也许世界已经准备好迎接一个令人惊讶的获胜者。统治中没有戏剧性。女足要想真正轰动全球，美国需要有实力的对手。<br><br>在本集中，我们向托宾·希思 (Tobin Heath) 和克里斯汀·普雷斯 (Christen Press) 提出了这个理论，尽管它很尴尬，他们主持了 YouTube 系列节目<em><a

“不不不。我明白你想在那里做什么，”希思说。 “但是，不，绝对不。我仍然认为美国女足国家队不仅是增加女足投资的斗争的火炬手，也是全球薪酬公平的火炬手。我认为美国女子国家队的成功是这项运动全球第一的推动者。”<br><br>请听这里的对话： <br><br><iframe class="lazyload"

href="https://pca.st/ccxU">袖珍铸件</a></em><br><br><strong><em>以下为采访实录：</em></strong><br><br><strong>汉娜·罗辛：</strong>克里斯汀，我一直在关注的一个动态是：在早些时候，美国女子国家队的大多数球员都来自一小部分大学球队。现在有更多的人来自职业女子团队。我想知道这如何改变动态。<br><br><strong>克里斯汀·普雷斯：</strong>是的，这真的很有趣。我认为我们正处于一个变化很快的环境中。我记得当第一批球员决定提前离开大学，或者不上大学时，我们这一代球员对此感到震惊和恐惧。因为我们对联盟的稳定性还没有信心。<br><br>现在这很常见，我认为这说明了我们在联赛层面取得了多大的进步。 NWSL（全国女子足球联盟）正在努力制定职业标准，让球员能够为国家队效力。<br><br>第九条以及大学课程的优势对于美国女子国家队的成功发挥了重要作用。随着这种情况的发展，我们的联盟确实有责任继续帮助球员发展并找到他们在国际水平上获胜所需的素质。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>你们是很酷、很独特的人。因为你正在经历这段活生生的历史。美国女足的变化如此之快。世界各地的女子足球变化如此之快。你正在观看它的建造过程。<br><br><strong>托宾·希思：</strong>是的，我喜欢这个。活生生的历史。这是真的。我总是说，我们在构建梦想的同时也在实现它。因为我们在职业生涯中取得的很多成就，当我们刚开始打球时，这些东西对我们来说甚至还不存在。<br><br>正如克里斯汀现在提到的，NWSL 已进入第 11 或第 12 年，这是惊人的。过去两个联赛都失败了。还没有超过五年。因此，即使看看这一进展，它也确实是独一无二的。每届世界杯，女足以及全球女子体育的格局都会发生巨大变化。<br><br>所以我们总是好奇会发生什么。我认为世界杯冠军也确实决定了这一点。 2015 年至 2019 年间，我们目睹了形势的巨大变化。你们刚才分享的机会就是来自这些机会。这是了解下一个转变是什么样子的独特时机。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>等等，你们真的认为什么事情都有可能发生吗？因为很有趣，现在的每一篇文章都是关于美国队将如何进行一场艰苦的战斗来赢得连续第三个冠军，因为其他球队正在迎头赶上。我不知道这是否只是让整件事变得有趣的原因。<br><br><strong>记者：</strong>哦，他们说每届世界杯。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>每届世界杯，如果你回顾每届世界杯的任何头条新闻。<br><br><strong>记者：</strong>但这也是事实。两者是同时进行的。我记得我的第一届世界杯。美国已经很久没有赢了，他们还在用这样的说辞：<em>哦，世界正在迎头赶上。</em><em>获胜将比以往任何时候都更加困难。</em><br><br>你知道，现在随着联赛在多个大洲取得成功，世界在投资方面正在迎头赶上。我认为随着奖金的不断增加，只会鼓励联合会继续投资，这将使锦标赛变得更好。<br><br>从我第一次参加世界杯到现在，我的最终感受是：太棒了，你想击败最好的球队。你希望每个人都处于最佳状态。我们并不是想赢得这届世界杯，因为我们是投入最多的球队。我们希望每个人都能投资。我们想赢得世界杯。<br><br>当你谈论三连冠时，这是一个非常有趣的现象，因为它与掷硬币时的情况是一样的。每次掷硬币时，赔率都会重置。但从情感上来说，对我来说，球队能够取得三连胜是不可思议的。<br><br>因为每一届世界杯，我都会说，<em>我们几乎不可能获胜。</em>它是如此艰苦。你必须完美。你必须有足够的运气在你身边。你必须有如此多的优秀。这几乎是不可能的。然后我们就会赢，我会说，<em>天哪。</em>比如说，那是深不可测的。因此，想象一下连续三次这样做，真是令人难以承受。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>哦，你知道，现在有一个可怕的大问题。鉴于你刚才所说的一切，也许这更好——我什至可以这么说吗？——我的意思是，我知道你们支持美国，我也支持美国，但也许对美国来说，这对全球女子足球更好，而不是赢？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>不，不，不，我明白你想做什么。但是，不，绝对不。我仍然认为美国女足国家队不仅是增加女足投资的斗争的火炬手，也是全球薪酬公平的火炬手。我认为美国女子国家队的成功是我们这项运动在全球范围内获得应有认可和投资的第一推动力。<br><br>我认为我们仍然是团队，下面的，那就是最伟大的。我认为我们仍然对这项运动的格局影响最大。所以我认为，尽管我们有时想为其他国家加油，但我认为对这项运动来说最好的事情实际上是美国女子国家队再次获胜。<br><br>我认为很多机会都来​​自于此，因为我们是谁以及我们代表什么。但是，正如克里斯汀所说，三连冠是疯狂的。不这样做会更具破坏性，因为那样你就会回到零，对吗？<br><br>就像很多年的历史一样，已经过去了。我不想让它重置。但是，是的，我们会看看会发生什么。我的意思是，每个人都说任何人都可以获胜。我认为，最终输球的是美国女足国家队。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>尽管如此，请纵容我一下，因为你们在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://re-website.com/pages/recapshow">节目</a>中进行辩论；再给我一轮辩论。如果是另一支球队获胜呢？令人惊讶的团队？<br><br>那就太令人兴奋了。然后女子运动就会在世界各地扎根，到处都会有很多人观看。然后，即使是美国运动员也会有很多地方可以去，这只会建立整个全球运动。克里斯汀，你觉得怎么样？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>我认为问题是你需要一些基础设施来实现变革，对吧？因此，英格兰就是一个很好的例子。因为英格兰联赛表现非常好，他们有机会迅速进入大型体育场，利用英格兰国家队在欧洲杯上取得的成功。<br><br>所以，当你问这个问题时，我的想法和托宾完全一样。由于我们对基础设施的投资，我们能够从胜利中获得最大收益。显然，作为美国人，我们也倾向于认为我们的新闻是全球新闻。但我认为球队的历史就是为变革而奋斗。这在美国女子国家队的文化中根深蒂固。我确实认为这种情况具有传染性，而且一直以来都具有传染性，其他国家也受到了我们一直在进行并取得胜利的斗争的鼓舞。<br><br>在某些时候，我们希望如此。我们在我们国家看到的变化，我们希望它能够迅速涌入所有国家。但我确实认为，实际上，我们处于继续产生最大影响的最佳位置。这只是因为有多少人报道它，有多少人在我们国家观看比赛，我们的联赛在哪里，我们必须在哪些体育场出售门票和商品——所有这些。<br><br>因为最终推动业务发展的是金钱，对吗？这就是美国能够实现变革并产生影响的原因——基础设施及其业务推动一切向前发展。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>是的。我想补充一点，我认为实际上可能发生的最糟糕的事情是，如果美国女足国家队输了，而英格兰队赢了。就基础设施而言。在克里斯汀看来，因为他们拥有扩大成功的基础设施。<br><br>我们已经在欧元上看到了这一点。他们仅仅从那场比赛中就取得了巨大的规模。凭借世界杯的规模，我认为这将真正彻底改变欧洲足球。我认为这将是一个真正的竞争优势，因为如果他们获胜，他们就代表了整个欧洲。如果我们赢了，我们就代表了我们和我们的统治地位。这完全是另一个等式。如果我们有这个播客的第 2 部分，您可以在那里观看。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>等等，但是托宾，你是说如果英国队赢了也一样好吗？因为他们有完全不同的模型。我知道你对这种模式有一些经验，他们隶属于这些传奇的男子俱乐部，比如曼联和阿森纳。我也想知道这样做的优点和缺点。这是促进和发展女子足球的神奇方式吗？还是这让他们处于男足的阴影之下？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>这是一个完全不同的模型。我更关心的是它是否具有很强的竞争力，但又是一种不同的竞争。我坚信女性团队的独立所有权。我们已经看到了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-soccer/674802/">天使之城的</a>成功。我坚信，如果你和男队在同一把伞下，你本质上永远是第二名。这真的很难进化出来。<br><br>在美国，对于女性来说，我们是第一运动。我们国家的男子足球可能排名第五？所以我认为独立对我们更有利，因为我认为我们国家的女性运动是第一，那么你为什么要模仿我们国家的第五运动呢？<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>但在英国，我认为情况完全相反。事实上，我认为他们在男子球队的保护下有很多好处，因为结构，因为球迷基础，因为足球在那个国家的意义的历史。我认为，如果他们要赢得世界杯，那将是可怕的，他们在这些庞大的建筑中可能拥有的规模和潜力。因为即使她们的排名仅次于男性，这也是一个荒谬的规模。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>天哪，托宾，但现在我觉得那太好了。你会在海外拥有这样一个令人惊叹的大规模机会吗？我们会拥有伟大的美国团队并持续多年吗？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>小心点，听起来你可能是在支持英格兰队。<br><br><strong>松香：</strong> 【<em>笑。</em> ] 确切地。你知道，我很好奇，里面的体验是什么样的？公平地说，我认为你的意思是，该模式在英国行之有效。你可以明白为什么它在英国行之有效。我们的模式对我们来说效果很好，但是在一个团队中的内部体验是什么？附属于一家著名的男子俱乐部与美国天使城女子球队的经历？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>嗯，我会说我在曼联的时间是在欧洲杯之前，所以我实际上希望这家具乐部和大多数俱乐部都能取得跨越式发展。但我认为天使城也是一种独立的，因为它不仅仅是独立所有权；它是独立的。这是女性所有权。<br><br>因此，当我们在天使城谈论球员需求和球队需求时，谈话的本质是我从未经历过的，因为我正在和那些真正相信我的价值、我们的价值、球队的价值的人交谈。他们之所以从事这项工作，是因为他们想要创造和放大我们这项运动中存在的价值。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>等等。你能详细说明一下吗？就像你对曼联与天使城的做法有何看法？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>是的，我认为，总结一下：投资女性游戏的想法是因为这是<em>正确的</em>做法，我觉得很多男性高管都来自这个领域。而不是投资女子比赛，因为这是一个很棒的商业模式，将为球迷和利益相关者创造大量价值。<br><br>所以，你知道，曼联他们签下了我们。他们认识托宾和我。我们在争取公平和薪酬方面享有盛誉。他们有点知道自己会得到什么。公平地说，他们有一个与我们分享的关于为女性建造设施和成长的计划。<br><br>但这是我们一直听到的情绪。<em>哦，我正在这样做——我知道这是正确的做法。我这样做是为了我的女儿。这是正确的做法。</em>当你与天使城的卡拉·诺特曼和朱莉交谈时，他们这样做是因为他们相信这一点，因为他们相信这是一项伟大的商业举措。<br><br>他们相信我们都会崛起。这股浪潮将一起上涨。<br><br> <strong>[<em>音乐</em>]</strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>我们要短暂休息一下。当我们回来时：1999 年世界杯改变了这项运动。你猜怎么着？希斯和普雷斯都在那里。<br><br> <strong>[<em>音乐</em>]</strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>我回想起你们刚开始的时候。所以，1999 年女足世界杯期间，你一定还不到十几岁，当时人们的兴趣爆发了，决赛在玫瑰碗举行，现场有 90,000 名观众，这是一个巨大的记录。那是你开始意识到足球的那一刻吗？<br><br>因为那一刻感觉你所描述的一切都将在红地毯上铺开。它即将发生。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>是的，当你谈论“11”、“15”、“19”以及所有美国女足世界杯决赛中的黄金一代时，你说得完全正确。 1999 年，我参加了美国女子国家队在新泽西州的首场比赛。克里斯汀参加了玫瑰碗决赛。<br><br>如果你实际上与美国女子国家队的大多数球员交谈过，他们要么参加了其中一场比赛，要么对那场比赛有一个非常震撼的故事。但我想这是我们所有人第一次睁开眼睛说：“哇，我想<em>这么做</em>。”<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>等等，你当时<em>在场</em>吗？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>我参加了揭幕战；克里斯汀进入了决赛。显然我们当时并不认识。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>那太大了。那么你是否认为：<em>哦，足球是一种职业。比如，我可以赚钱。这是我一生都可以专业做的事情吗</em>？<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>是的。这很有趣，因为我是一个非常自大的小孩。 [<em>笑。</em> 】 我还是个趾高气扬的小大人。但那是梅多兰兹，我记得在那里，我和我的足球队一起来，我在草地上踢球。我穿着米娅·哈姆的球衣。我们当时正在玩皮卡。<br><br>我记得当时我心里想——我想我当时只有 12 岁——比如：<em>哇，我现在已经足够优秀了，可以进入那个领域了。</em><br><br><strong>松香：</strong> 【<em>笑。</em> ] 棒极了。太棒了。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>我认为，拥有那种程度的兴趣和热情——当你走进那个体育场，你感受到那种能量，你往球场上看，你看到了一个你相信自己可以成为的榜样——是非常强大的。<br><br>这就是为什么，对于天使城来说，当你走进那个体育场时，性别完全消失了。我认为在那一刻，我们小时候都感受到性别已经完全消失了。这真是太棒了，这是我们未来可以拥有的机会。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong> Christen，你在 1999 年玫瑰碗决赛中的经历是什么？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>是的，实际上我有一张我和我的团队、我的姐妹们和我的脸画着的照片。当我看照片时，我可以在我的眼睛里看到它。我当时想：<em>我能做到。</em>我<em>当时</em>认为我做不到；我还没准备好。但我认为这就是梦想，那就是目标。<br><br>老实说，当我第一次被国家队征召时，我什至不知道这是一份有薪工作。我认为为国家队效力是一种荣幸，是一件令人惊奇的事情，你甚至不会得到报酬。这么说很尴尬，但我认为这很重要，因为即使是我们的球员协会在向世界进行体育教育方面也取得了如此大的进步。女性的经济解放对于我们所争取的社会进步极其重要。因此，希望永远不会有球员在离开时不知道他们所做的事情具有经济价值。<br><br>但对我来说[1999]只是心眼。看看那些在这个层面上受到充分重视、赞赏和庆祝的女性。那里有这么多人，这改变了我的生活，因为它绝对只是看到了我以前从未见过的照片。并看到有机会做一些事情，实现这个梦想并使其达到如此规模。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>我想说的是，就克里斯汀的观点而言，当我真正进入国家队时，我没有得到报酬，因为当我进入国家队时，我刚刚开始上大学。所以我什至没有想过进入国家队是为了拿薪水。对我来说，这只是一种荣誉。我想成为这个团队的一员，了解它的象征和作用。我的第一个世界冠军是 2008 年奥运会，我记得我所有的队友都非常兴奋，因为我加入了球队，因为这意味着如果我们赢了，他们会得到更多的奖金——因为我在大学时没有得到任何奖金运动员。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>天哪。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>所以他们说，<em>是的。很高兴托宾出现在名单上。</em><br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>你能否真正清楚地表达出来——这样听的人才能真正理解——当球员获得报酬时会产生什么不同。我知道这是一个疯狂的问题，但现在你看到人们得到报酬，过着真正的生活，这实际上改变了什么？<br><br><strong>按：</strong>嗯，它改变了一切。我们希望最好的球员、最好的运动员来完成这项工作。这就是推动游戏向前发展的原因。它必须是一种可持续的生活方式。你必须能够将自己的一生奉献给这项运动，并且有足够的钱来度过余生，这样它才能成为一项真正的职业运动。<br><br>因为当你在这些<em>我们得到报酬，但还不够的</em>情况下，我们仍在解决这个问题时，你总是会分心，你必须做其他事情或将你的时间和日子分开，以便赚足够的钱来生存。<br><br>我认为这只会降低这项运动的质量。我们整个职业生涯都在为下一代球员不需要再找工作，不需要在退役后工作，不需要担心职业生涯的到来而奋斗。最后，<em>我该如何继续赚钱？</em>他们不必在周末去诊所，也不必花几百美元去四小时外的诊所，因为他们需要额外的收入。这就是目标。目标是让职业女运动员成为职业运动员。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>是的。我认为这是新一代人必须应对的挑战。我认为我们这一代人中的很多人，我们为我们所得到的每一件事而奋斗，然后是这项运动的未来显然将得到的每一件事。真的感觉像是赚到了一些东西。我知道这样说很奇怪，但是当你从一个白手起家的模式转变为一个赢得同工同酬的模式时，现在这是美国女子国家队和男子国家队第一次在比赛开始之前就得到了同等的报酬，这感觉像是很多基础收入。<br><br>现在我看看这一代人，我认为这是新一代的女性职业运动员。他们面临着新的挑战，因为他们拥有这些个人品牌、这些个人代言，正如克里斯汀所说，这些真正改变了他们成为职业运动员的方式。这就是我们一直在推动的，对吧？<br><br>但他们没有我们为之奋斗的那种基本的收入意识。我认为这将带来一种不同类型的心态，并且这种心态必须通过美国女子国家队的这一过程而不断发展。<br><br>因为美国女足国家队的整体比任何一个部分都更伟大。现在这些零件变得更有价值了。那么各个部分的价值如何影响整体的价值呢？所以这会很有趣——看看未来会是什么样子。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>噢，我明白了。所以你的意思是你们必须作为一个团队来战斗。就像，你们有理由进行这种团结，因为你们正在为这些基本权利而奋斗。然而，这些参与者带着个人品牌——可能是社交媒体品牌、代言等——进来，所以他们在很大程度上是个人，所以他们的挑战是：那么，我们如何团结一致？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>我的意思是，在这场比赛开始之前，他们中的大多数人已经赚到了比我们在 2015 年或 2019 年获胜时赚到的钱更多的钱。所以我们的收入实际上取决于团队的成功。因此，作为一名专业人士，现在的心态非常不同，我们必须观察结果如何。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>对。因为除非你赢了，否则你们甚至不会得到报酬。就像他们会给你奖金一样，但整个团队都必须获胜。这与每个球员要取得的成就无关。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>没错。是的。<br><br><strong>记者：</strong>谈话中有趣的部分是：我们必须赢得世界杯才能赢得同工同酬，但我们是否需要争取同工同酬才能赢得世界杯？<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>嗯。<br><br> <strong>Press：</strong>显然，我们永远不会知道。但我认为每个观看 2019 年世界杯的人都会感觉到我们正在为比我们更伟大的目标而战。我们有这种外部动机，它是如此鼓舞人心、如此团结，以至于我——我是一个有精神的人；我相信这就是我们获胜的原因。我相信我们获胜是因为我们有代表世界各地女性的工作要做。<br><br>现在我们即将进入世界杯，必须有一种不同的无形资产。这场比赛并不是美国女子国家队争取同工同酬的斗争。那么它是什么？你是否需要外部动力来赢得这场比赛？<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>那真的很漂亮。我的意思是，那是什么？你们谈论这个吗？比如，你认为可以让他们走到一起的无形动力是什么？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>我的意思是，他们正在为三连冠历史而战。是的。我认为棘手的是有什么？队里有五名球员真的——<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>确实是三连冠。<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>是的，三连冠。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>所以是他们——他们必须用他们的目标激励每个人。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>是的，球队正在为之奋斗，但实际上只有几个非凡的个人才能赢得三场胜利。其他人，两个，也许一个。但这很有趣。我喜欢你刚才所说的为更多的东西而奋斗。我认为作为一个团体和集体，你会围绕某件事团结起来。<br><br>我不知道那是什么，但我很确定如果这支球队一路进入决赛，我们就会看到它；我们就会知道那是什么东西。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>也许这只是为了梅根·拉皮诺（Megan Rapinoe）。也许这就像三连冠的拉皮诺一样。 [<em>笑。</em> 】 这样就够了。和你们聊天真是太有趣了。基本上，我想从这次谈话中学到的是学会观看这些比赛，并以你们俩的方式看待这个世界。我觉得你们是很棒的向导，我真的很感激。非常感谢你们俩。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>任何时候。<br><br>
