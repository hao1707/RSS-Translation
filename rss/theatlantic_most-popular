试图阻止一名持刀袭击者袭击抗议者，但袭击者挣脱了束缚并向他扑来。这名男子将Chiu拉近，以一种好战的拥抱，用牙齿咬住Chiu的左耳，然后把他的头猛地向后一仰，当Chiu伸手发现血液从他的头上溢出时，他把一大块蜿蜒的肉吐到了砖砌人行道上。<br><br>试图重新接上邱的耳朵的尝试没有成功。他在医院度过了19天的康复期。后来，在对袭击者的审判中，邱作证时回忆起他的肢体从头上被扯下来时听到的怪异的“

href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3156431/hong-kong-protests-ill-never-forgot-pluck-sound-my-ear">拔</a>”声。这次袭击使邱在无领导的民主运动中短暂提升，抗议者将他的遭遇视为中国共产党支持者邪恶的一个例子。邱继续其活动、竞选活动和公开露面，头部左侧缠着大绷带，直到 2021 年因违反北京实施的国家安全法而被捕。<br><br> <a

2019年香港大规模示威活动最显着的特点之一就是团结。该运动吸引了来自不同年龄和社会经济群体的数百万抗议者。支持民主的政治家也搁置了长期存在的分歧。当一些参与者转向暴力和破坏公物等激进策略时，社会运动往往会分裂，但香港的运动却异常连贯。街头巷尾，“兄弟同爬山，各尽所能”成为流行语。另一条则更简单：“不要分裂。”<br><br>四年后，北京不仅压制了异见，还彻底重建了中国最自由的城市。它也成功地打破了这种统一。 37 岁的邱是政府在一次全面审判中的关键证人，该审判可能会导致该市大部分最著名的民主倡导者入狱，刑罚最高可达终身监禁。他是众多转投立场的反对派人士之一，现在正在协助他们曾经对抗的政府。涉案的其他三人也进行了配合，其中一人甚至在社交媒体上发布了中国国家主席习近平的讲话。现已解散的<em>《苹果日报</em>》的一些编辑可能会在今年晚些时候出庭指证他们的前任老板、媒体大亨黎智英，另外两名年轻人也将出庭作证，政府称这两名年轻人参与了一场阴谋，将黎智英塑造为抗议活动的主谋。<br><br> <a

Morgenbesser）告诉我，这种策略是双重的，他的研究重点是威权主义。翻转的证人帮助政府“兜售该运动由于其犯罪基础而不值得支持的故事”，并植入“当前的熟人可以成为未来的线人”的想法，这可以阻止人们参与示威活动。<br><br> “这些证词有效地对潜在合作者之间的信任程度施加了压力，”他说，“让公民怀疑他们所依赖的政治关系。”<br><br>认罪的邱今年春天提供了两周多的证词，重点是他<a

年举行的</a>非正式民主初选中所扮演的角色，即北京颁布《国家安全法》几天后。此次投票是一位前法学教授制定的一项大胆计划的一部分，该计划旨在将抗议运动从街头带入正式的政府大厅。人们希望亲民主候选人能够在该市立法机构中获得多数席位，他们将在立法机构中投票否决法案，并最终通过阻止该市预算来迫使首席执行官下台。民主运动举行初选，选出最受欢迎的候选人。<br><br> 2020 年 7 月的两天内，超过 60 万城市居民在这场非官方初选中投票。但许多参加的候选人被<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-hongkong-security/hong-kong-blocks-12-democrats-from-election-as-china-security-law-shadow-looms-idUSKCN24V1AK">取消了</a>参加原定于 9 月举行的选举的资格。该市领导人随后以大流行的威胁为由，利用殖民时代的法律<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/31/concern-as-hong-kong-postpones-elections-for-one-year-citing-covid-19">推迟了</a>投票。次年举行选举时，选举进行了重新设计，以确保只有“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/30/asia/china-hong-kong-elections-intl-hnk/index.html">爱国者</a>”才能参加，并产生一个没有反对派的立法机构。<br><br>邱是因参加初选而被捕并被指控密谋颠覆的 47 人之一，其中包括律师、劳工活动人士和支持 LGBTQ 的倡导者。自 2021 年 2 月以来，大多数人一直被关押，不得保释； 31人已<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/06/world/asia/hong-kong-47-democracy-trial.html">认罪</a>。根据<em>《大西洋月刊》</em>查阅的数十页证词，邱是香港最大的民主政党民主党的长期党员，他将自己描绘成一个倒霉的旁观者，赞同政府所说的秘密。 ，险恶的阴谋。事实上，这次民意调查是一次简单的民主实践。<br><br>邱和其他几人的合作让活动人士和昔日的朋友感到愤怒和沮丧。这一消息传出之际，香港的民主运动正处于市内最低点，全球对香港困境的关注正在减弱，海外的活动团体因内讧而分裂。<br><br>与此同时，该市当局将 2019 年的示威活动重新描述为一场外国支持的暴力“颜色革命”，并试图抹去它的记忆并抹去它的护身符。他们已将焦点转向政府所称的“软抵抗”，这是一个模糊的术语，似乎涵盖了任何对权力结构表示不满的活动。政府希望在法庭上获得一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/06/15/asia/hong-kong-protest-song-crackdown-streaming-platforms-intl-hnk/index.html">禁令</a>，禁止广播、出版或分发流行的抗议歌曲。本月早些时候，警方对居住在美国、英国和澳大利亚的 8 名活动人士<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2023/07/03/1185795838/hong-kong-arrest-warrants-activists-nathan-law">发出了</a>逮捕令，并悬赏约 13 万美元。这八人被指控违反了具有全球影响力的国家安全法，香港行政长官李家超<a

“在一个曾经以其充满活力和多元化的公共广场而闻名的城市，没有人愿意在公共场合分享对政府的批评甚至轻微讽刺的言论或漫画，有时甚至在私下里与朋友分享，”前法律院长约翰内斯·陈(Johannes Chan)说香港大学的教授在最近一篇文章中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://usali.org/usali-perspectives-blog/hong-kongs-national-security-law-turns-three">写道</a>，该文章探讨了三年后国家安全法的影响。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/10/hong-kong-democracy/620425/">阅读：香港精英如何转向民主</a><br><br>邱在政治上雄心勃勃。 2007 年，22 岁的他当选为区议员，成为该市最年轻的议员之一。据一位密友说，他的努力激怒了民主派内部的一些人。他和我采访过的其他人一样，要求匿名，以便了解情况。避免可能产生的后果。邱渴望成为众人瞩目的焦点，当他没有得到他认为应得的关注并且没有像他预期的那样迅速晋升政治职位时，他感到受到了轻视。他的朋友告诉我，这些怨恨使他成为有吸引力的合作目标：“他变得软弱了。一旦屈服……压力就会越来越大。而且你会做出越来越多的让步。”<br><br> “这非常令人难过，”一位参与此案的律师最近告诉我。 “我理解他们为什么这么做；没有人愿意在监狱里呆的时间超过他们需要的时间。”邱和其他人可能希望合作能让他们免受最严厉的监禁，而根据英国统治遗留下来的香港普通法法院制度，在刑事案件中认罪通常会产生这种效果。但在融合了香港普通法传统和北京专制司法体系的国家安全法下，国家安全案件的定罪率为100%，而且合作的优势并不明显，因为没有先例或案例。法律。<br><br>邱对政府案件的证词的价值是显而易见的。在对 47 名初选候选人长达数月的审判过程中，检察官利用被告的社交媒体帖子和公开声明作为共谋证据。 “这肯定是世界上第一个阴谋，每个参与其中的人都告诉任何人他们打算做什么，”律师最近告诉我。 Chiu 以及博士 Au Nok-hin 等人的证词学生和前民主派议员，在一项众所周知的计划中添加了邪恶的幕后动画，并声称其计划和意图。 “整个案件取决于那些证人，”知情人士告诉我。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/05/hong-kong-prodemocracy-activists-exile-beijing/629741/">阅读：“在下面，一切都变了”</a><br><br>尽管这种策略的使用在香港是一种新的、不祥的趋势，但在其他地方却很普遍。北京长期以来一直利用逼供来分裂它认为具有威胁性的大陆运动。白俄罗斯活动人士罗曼·普罗塔塞维奇两年前因乘坐的飞机被迫降落在明斯克而被捕，今年早些时候，他获得了独裁者亚历山大·卢卡申科的赦免。反对派活动人士<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/23/world/europe/belarus-roman-protasevich-pardon.html">指责</a>普罗塔塞维奇背叛并与他曾经激烈批评的政府合作。目前还不清楚他在监狱期间可能受到什么类型的待遇。<br><br>李·摩根贝瑟告诉我，反对派运动前成员的证词“旨在揭露、缓解和分裂”。他们对这场运动感到担忧，“线人的存在在关键成员之间播下了不信任的种子，并扰乱了未来的计划。”<br><br>香港对八名海外活动人士的悬赏也有类似的目的。鉴于这些活动人士所在国家已暂停与香港的引渡协议，逮捕他们的呼声主要是为了展示政治实力和造成心理伤害。香港当局已经<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/jul/07/hong-kong-pro-democracy-activist-arrests">逮捕了</a>五名被控协助活动人士的香港人，并采取了大陆的另一种策略，对其中一名香港人的家人<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/11/china/hong-kong-nsl-nathan-law-family-questioned-intl-hnk/index.html">进行了讯问</a>。政府内部智库顾问刘兆佳在最近的官方媒体中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.chinadailyhk.com/article/339082#Warrants-for-eight-fugitives:-The-political-significance">写道</a>，与流亡者接触将“给他们的亲人带来灾难”，让他们成为贱民会损害他们的“动员能力”意见片。摩根贝塞尔说，当局正在营造一种“不信任和谴责的气氛”，“政府将公民的注意力集中在它自己认为对国家构成危险的事情上”。<br><br>由于嘲笑和恶意地对待昔日的同胞，邱在民主运动的前同事中赢得了特殊的敌意。其他被告有时会公开质问他，嘲笑他的证词，并在法庭上辱骂他。他的朋友告诉我，一旦赵获释，他可能需要离开香港。他的证词支离破碎，有时甚至与他过去声明的政治立场完全不一致。即使是由首席执行官亲自挑选来处理此案的法官小组有时也会对他不断变化的叙述感到沮丧和愤怒。<br><br>涉案律师告诉我，邱的转变已经如此彻底，很难完全理解。律师说，他就像“一个以前抽烟的人，但现在无法忍受身边的烟味”。<br><br></div>

Tracker，该产品于 2008 年推出，并创建了跟踪食品配送的早期标准。 Domino&#39;s 现在有大约<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://digiday.com/marketing/dominos-house-technology-push-helped-increase-online-orders/">15 种不同的</a>披萨订购<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://digiday.com/marketing/dominos-house-technology-push-helped-increase-online-orders/">方式</a>，包括语音助手、Facebook Messenger、Slack 和一个<a

href="https://ir.dominos.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dominos-pizzar-announces-third-quarter-2022-financial-results">三分之一</a>披萨外卖的服务商。其他餐厅，无论是披萨店还是其他餐厅，都已经开始依赖一系列第三方应用程序，而达美乐则将一切都保留在内部，这意味着它处于领先地位 - 从理论上讲，您也是如此。没有邮递员，没问题：只需<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dominos.com/en/pages/order/#!/checkout/">9.99 美元左右</a>，加上少量费用和小费，多米诺 (Domino) 司机就会送出一份达美乐 (Domino) 披萨，30 分钟内就会送到您家门口。<br><br>但本周早些时候，达美乐<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dominos-pizza-strikes-deal-with-uber-in-search-for-new-sales-4e6b21fd">宣布</a>它也将与一款送货应用程序合作。到 2023 年底，大多数地方的饥饿群众将能够通过 Uber Eats 订购达美乐 (Domino) 馅饼和各种钠炸弹（尽管达美乐 (Domino) 的司机仍将送餐）。通过与 Uber 联手，该公司承认 DoorDash、Uber Eats 和 Grubhub 等外卖应用程序已成为主导地位——使用它们已接近餐厅维持生计的必要要求。如果 Domino&#39;s 都无法摆脱送货应用程序，那么还有谁可以呢？<br><br>恰如其分的是，美国的送餐热潮实际上是从达美乐开始的。该公司<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/27/business/pizza-s-home-delivery-war.html">经常被认为</a>推广了披萨外卖的概念（ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/pizza-delivery-box-design-soggy/672712/">它</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/01/pizza-delivery-box-design-soggy/672712/">创造了现代披萨盒</a>，联合创始人汤姆·莫纳汉甚至在送披萨时<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2007/02/19/the-deliverer">遇见了他的妻子</a>）。尽管披萨订购从固定电话和手机转向通过移动应用程序拨号，但以送货为中心的多米诺骨牌模式却拥有惊人的寿命。 2011 年，时任首席执行官帕特里克·多伊尔 (Patrick Doyle) 开始了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://pizzaturnaround.com/">一场不太可能的全国性广告活动</a>，承认他的披萨有点糟糕，不久后，他向他的技术团队<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncr.com/blogs/restaurants/digital-innovations-dominos">发出了挑战</a>：他希望订购披萨变得足够简单，以便有人可以在等待时完成在红绿灯处。移动点餐是未来，未来，披萨点餐只需 17 秒。<br><br>从某种意义上说，达美乐已经成为其自身成功的受害者。该公司的技术悟性帮助公众做好了不仅仅是披萨外卖的准备。这些第三方应用程序出现在 2010 年代零工经济繁荣时期，然后在疫情早期爆发。随着疫情放缓，食品配送销售本可以重蹈 Peloton 的覆辙，但<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/future-of-restaurants-study.html">事实并非如此</a>。去年，大约 14% 的披萨销量是通过外卖应用程序<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dominos-pizza-strikes-deal-with-uber-in-search-for-new-sales-4e6b21fd">完成的</a>，此外还有一系列让餐厅菜单看起来平淡无奇的菜肴和菜肴。截至 2023 年，数十万家餐厅都使用了外卖应用，提供高级餐厅的干式熟成牛排和麦当劳的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/steak-egg-cheese-bagel.html">干式牛排百吉饼</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/product/steak-egg-cheese-bagel.html">。</a>餐厅的餐厅可能会再次爆满，但这些应用程序<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://secondmeasure.com/datapoints/food-delivery-services-grubhub-uber-eats-doordash-postmates/">现在带来的收入比以往任何时候都多</a>。<br><br>换句话说，它们已经变得太大而不容忽视。尽管达美乐将继续提供自己的披萨，但其首席执行官拉塞尔·韦纳 (Russell Weiner) 在讨论 Uber Eats 优食交易时，用简单的语言<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/financing/dominos-uber-eats-deal-acknowledges-reality-third-party-marketplace">表达了错过的成本</a>：“聚合平台上发生了 50 亿美元的披萨销售额……[那]我们应该有三分之一。”<br><br>随着数以百万计的餐厅员工准备订单和数以百万计的零工为他们送货，整个食品配送生态系统已经合并，这对餐厅和整个餐饮文化都产生了巨大的影响。这些应用程序可以向餐厅收取<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/clark-county/clark-county-caps-third-party-food-delivery-fees-at-15-2087939/">高达</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reviewjournal.com/news/politics-and-government/clark-county/clark-county-caps-third-party-food-delivery-fees-at-15-2087939/">30% 的</a>费用，这给利润本来就很紧张的企业带来了沉重的负担，需要大量的订单量才能实现收支平衡。他们拥有如此大的权力，以至于他们现在正在影响<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://get.grubhub.com/blog/delivery-menu-tips/">餐馆的菜单</a>，有时即使你在里面用餐。与此同时，承担所有这些职能的送货员仍然作为独立承包商获得低工资，没有任何保护或讨价还价的能力。<br><br>对于食客来说，将科技进一步引入餐饮业是有成本的。根据 2021 年的一份报告，送餐应用程序与社交媒体巨头<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/social-media-and-food-delivery-apps-sell-the-most-personal-data">并驾齐驱</a>，成为消费者个人数据的最大收集者和兜售者。多米诺<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/dominos-pizza-strikes-deal-with-uber-in-search-for-new-sales-4e6b21fd">自己承认</a>，Uber 愿意交出客户数据是其决定与该公司达成协议的关键因素。即使在沙发上订购任何东西变得更加容易和方便，外卖应用程序将继续迫使餐厅调整其运营以适应他们的需求。无论您每天晚上都订购送货服务还是根本没有使用过应用程序，这一点都很重要。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 15 Jul 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid

Backyard”）运动面临的核心挑战，该运动是一个由学者、政策制定者和草根活动家组成的意识形态多元化的组织，致力于一个简单到令人解除武装的想法，即在美国最繁荣的城镇建造新家园将是一件非常好的事情。作为一个智力项目，YIMBYism 取得了巨大的成功，这是有充分理由的。大量证据表明，增加住房供应以满足住房需求可以 <a data-event-element="inline link"

年以来，加利福尼亚州立法机构通过了一系列措施，以取代当地一些最恶劣的土地使用法规，促使<a data-event-element="inline link"

”此外，尽管绝大多数受访者“广泛接受多样性作为其社区当前或理想的特征”，但他们对邻居比他们贫穷得多的想法深感不安。<br><br>这种怀疑并不是金州独有的。今年 1 月，州长凯西·霍赫尔 (Kathy Hochul) 公布了“纽约住房契约”，这是一套雄心勃勃的改革措施，旨在提高纽约市及其臭名昭著的昂贵郊区的住房生产。到五月， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://manhattan.institute/article/nyc-housing-crisis-next-steps-after-new-york-housing-compact-fails">住房契约已经失效</a>。 <a data-event-element="inline link"

想要推动更多美国人朝他们的方向发展，他们最好少些威吓，多些倾听。<br><br>一些最热心的 YIMBY 坚信自己的正义，采取了道德姿态，谴责顽固的房主是势利者或偏执狂，并呼吁采取全面的立法措施，剥夺地方政府的土地使用权，并进一步限制房东的能力。选择他们的租户。理查德·卡伦伯格的新书《 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Excluded-Zoning-NIMBYism-Class-Build/dp/1541701461"><em>排除》</em></a>是这种情感的完美升华。<br><br>卡伦伯格以其对精英大学种族偏好的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/10/supreme-court-harvard-affirmative-action-legacy-admissions-equity/671869/">逆向批评</a>而闻名，他将自己的公共生活奉献给了种族和经济融合的论证。排除者并不满足于对可能会吸引房主自身利益的排他性分区提出审慎的理由，<em>他们</em>认为这种做法是一种道德上的愤怒——阶级主义，也隐含着种族主义——我们需要一场道德运动来根除它。联邦政府全力出动，仿照上个世纪反对种族隔离的斗争。为此，卡伦伯格呼吁制定一项经济公平住房法案，允许对歧视穷人或对不同阶层产生不必要的不​​同影响的分区政策提出诉讼，并由法官决定什么是必要的。这实际上相当于联邦政府对单户住宅分区的禁令，也会威胁到无数其他分区政策，并且在很大程度上通过基于模糊、主观的法律标准威胁提起昂贵的诉讼来威慑地方政府。<br><br>虽然这一论点肯定会引起一些社会正义进步人士的共鸣，但不太可能说服那些担心社区变化前景的焦虑的房主和租客。加州大学戴维斯分校土地使用法教授克里斯·埃尔门多夫警告说，将分区改革视为经济正义问题可能会适得其反。今天的富裕郊区居民可能会对<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/race-and-zoning">他们犯有种族敌意的说法感到不满</a>，但他们完全乐意被指控为色盲阶级偏见。<br><br>反对在自家后院修建新住房的人可能不是特别开明，但他们也不是妄想。顾名思义，排他性分区是一种通过部署地方土地使用监管来吸引富裕居民并阻止贫困居民来改善地方税基的策略。美国的地方公共服务主要由地方财产税和其他市政收入（例如销售税、停车费和污水处理费）提供资金。人们不必是一个可恨的势利小人，也能认识到，虽然一些新来者在当地创造的收入会多于他们在服务中获得的收入，但其他人却不会。<br><br>事实上，这些地方财政压力可以说是塑造美国支离破碎的大都市地理的核心力量。正如普林斯顿大学经济学家利亚·布斯坦（Leah Boustan） <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691150871/competition-in-the-promised-land"><em>在《应许之地的竞争》一书中</em></a>指出的那样，战后时代的“白人逃亡”在很大程度上是由这些财政问题驱动的。随着贫穷的黑人移民前往东北部、中西部和西部的城市中心，大量富裕的白人家庭搬到平均收入高于他们离开的城市的郊区管辖区。毫无疑问，这种向外移民的部分原因是白人不愿与黑人邻居一起生活，但由于这一时期美国城市的隔离程度如此之高，大部分逃亡者都来自纯白人社区。城市居民离开这些白人社区的动机不是担心与黑人邻居进行社会交往，而是担心与有不同需求和优先事项的低收入邻居进行财政交往。 “搬到郊区，”布斯坦写道，“让白人家庭能够将自己与中心城市提供的不断变化的当地公共产品和财政义务隔离开来。”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/07/white-flight-alive-and-well/399980/">阅读：白色飞行从未结束</a><br><br>鉴于这些强大的财政激励措施，小型郊区司法管辖区的邻避主义几乎是不可避免的。与其指望道德劝说能够改变这些社区的分区政策，YIMBY 人最好采取一种更加谦虚和现实的方法，努力与郊区的邻避者相向而行。<br><br>赢得郊区房主的青睐的一个直接方法是推进住房改革，帮助他们积累财富，正如埃尔门多夫<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/the-housing-treadmill">所建议的</a>那样。例如，附属住宅单元的合法化可以让普通房主富裕起来，无论公平与否，普通房主都比大型开发商享有更多的公众同情，并且可以动员他们反对成本增加的市政影响费和自由裁量审查程序。作为额外的好处，这种改革让 YIMBY 能够在尊重财产权和个人自由的基础上发出<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.city-journal.org/article/where-are-all-the-republican-yimbys">更加乐观的呼吁</a>，这一主张帮助俄勒冈州、犹他州和蒙大拿州通过了分区改革法律。<br><br>当面对坚决的郊区阻力时，例如在纽约州南部，霍赫尔的住房契约被证明是一个巨大的政治负担，YIMBYs 应该集中精力放松大城市的土地使用监管。在人口较多的司法管辖区，对住房建设的反对往往不那么强烈，部分原因是这些地区的贫富居民比例从定义上来说更难改变。城市社区也比郊区社区更具活力：其中租房者、年轻人、低收入家庭和其他住房流失率高于平均水平的人口比例过高。社区变化是这些社区生活的一个事实。如果城市核心区的分区改革取得成功，那么较小社区的住房增长将更加引人注目。<br><br>冒着激怒反商业进步人士的风险，YIMBY 还应该采取更多措施<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051921-102505">培养大型雇主作为政治盟友</a>。较低的住房成本是吸引和留住工人的有力工具，大型雇主可以对州立法机构施加重大影响。加州科技行业的雇主在反对严格分区的斗争中发挥了重要作用并非巧合——他们敏锐地意识到，随着金州住房成本的上涨，他们要么支付更高的工资，要么眼睁睁地看着他们的工人逃往城市在爱达荷州或内华达州。<br><br>最后，YIMBY 应该努力软化最初推动排斥性分区的地方财政激励措施。耶鲁大学法学院的扎卡里·利斯考 (Zachary Liscow) 发现， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nyulawreview.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NYULawReview-92-6-Liscow.pdf">当各州承担更大比例的学校经费时</a>，富人会变得更愿意搬到较贫穷的司法管辖区，可能是因为这样做将不再让他们承担为大量学生提供支持服务的特殊负担。纳税很少的邻居。与这种模式一致，他发现集中的学校经费导致低收入城市的税收降低。<br><br>类似的逻辑也适用于国家对治安和公共安全工作的资助。如果邻避者担心低收入移民的涌入会导致犯罪和骚乱激增，正如陈·扎克伯格研究所的调查结果强烈表明的那样，那么增加国家对当地执法机构的援助可能会减轻他们的担忧。一些主要的社交媒体左派人士不以为然地将这种支持分区改革和“破窗”监管的结合称为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://darrellowens.substack.com/p/whos-who-the-dictionary-of-in-my">监狱城市化</a>”，但社交媒体左派当然不是目标受众。<br><br>诚然，改变地方财政激励措施将是一项重大任务，这将遭到选民的抵制，他们担心在新的财政分配下会失败。但地方政府收入的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.urban.org/policy-centers/cross-center-initiatives/state-and-local-finance-initiative/state-and-local-backgrounders/state-and-local-revenues#local">30%</a>已经以州政府转移支付的形式出现。增加州政府为地方警务或公共教育提供资金的责任将是一个相对温和且可能非常受欢迎的变化，特别是与强制生产受契约限制的经济适用住房和其他优先事项的公平份额要求相比。 YIMBY 离开了。<br><br>修改地方财政激励措施、与地区商业精英结成联盟、帮助一些拥有丰富房产的房主变得更富有，不会带来一个从东海岸到西海岸的综合社区的平等新千年，但它将帮助 YIMBY 建立一个更有说服力的案例住房增长符合郊区居民开明的自身利益，否则他们可能会担心税收负担上升和房价下跌。这不是一个糟糕的开始。<br><br></div>

<em>Joy Ride</em>知道，回国探亲并不是缓解家里孤独感的简单方法。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6DFmKkJYZXtH8GYGMiig1wpay1k=/0x92:3000x1780/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/joyride_unit_210927_00234rc2/original.jpg" alt="《欢乐之旅》场景中，中国花园中的四位女性向银幕外望去" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>艾德·阿拉克尔 / 狮门影业</figcaption></figure>诚然，我对<em>Joy Ride表示怀疑。</em>过去几年，典型好莱坞类型的亚裔美国电影越来越多，例如浪漫喜剧、超级英雄大片和慢热剧情片。很多都非常出色，有些则不是那么出色，但在其中几部中，我注意到一个反复出现的主题：主角过于理想化地回到亚洲。一部关于亚裔美国被收养者和她的朋友们去中国<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/joy-ride-bottoms-raunchy-comedies/674691/">的新电影</a><em>《欢乐之旅》</em>似乎准备重演这一比喻。<br><br>但当影片上映 20 分钟时，当我因震惊和笑声而气喘吁吁时，我明白它正在做一些不同的事情。当奥黛丽（阿什利·帕克饰）来到中国时，我更感触到了这一点，并感叹每个人都长得像她。乍一看，你不是一个引人注目的少数群体，这种感觉被赋予了权力，这是关于侨民返乡的电影中相当典型的观察结果。 But before Audrey can get too excited, her best friend and travel companion, Lolo (Sherry Cola), points out that the airport has people from Taiwan and mainland China, as well as K-pop stars who are so glamorous, they bypass customs—and they&#39;re all legibly different. Audrey might be tempted to see these Asian faces as interchangeable so that she can feel like she belongs; Lolo implies that&#39;s a fantasy, not reality.<br><br> This is also a message to the audience: <em>Joy Ride</em> is interested in acknowledging—and then unraveling—what I&#39;m calling the motherland trope. I&#39;ve particularly noticed it in films of the past several years, where an Asian American character travels to Asia, though it can exist across cultures. Maybe the protagonist is flying to Singapore to meet their wealthy boyfriend&#39;s family à la <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/08/asian-americas-great-gatsby-moment/568213/"><em>Crazy Rich Asians</em></a> (a film that <em>Joy Ride</em> ’s director and co-writer, Adele Lim, also co-wrote). Perhaps they&#39;re on a fantastical superhero mission, as in Marvel&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/08/shang-chi-legend-ten-rings-marvel-review/619867/"><em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em></a> . Or maybe they&#39;re busking in the streets of South Korea and falling in love with a local manic pixie dream girl, as in the quieter indie film <em>Fiction and Other Realities.</em> Whatever the reason, the characters use a trip to Asia to understand themselves. At times, the motherland trope can be an effective structure to hold the emotional transformation of its main character. But at its worst, it turns Asian countries into a setting for Asian American protagonists to address their problems of alienation or loneliness back in the US—but fails to see these countries as places with their own complexity or diversity. It can start to feel like these characters are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2010/08/18/129254808/eat-pray-love-leave-orientalism-still-big-onscreen"><em>Eat Pray Love–</em> ing</a> among people they claim as their own.<br><br> Take a keystone of the motherland trope: the homecoming montage. In <em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> , the lead couple, Nick and Rachel, touch down in Singapore and are swept off to a night market, where friendly neighborhood aunties and uncles smile at them while deftly preparing delicious satays and laksa. In <em>Shang-Chi</em> , the Asian American protagonists play out a thematically identical sequence in Macau, speeding through the neon-lit city, gawking at dancers and vendors in the street. Both films end with the second-generation Americans experiencing profound growth: Rachel gains self-confidence (as well as a husband), and Shang-Chi becomes a literal super hero.<br><br> Upon first glance, <em>Joy Ride</em> might not look like it&#39;s swerving from these broad-strokes plotlines. The story follows Audrey, a Chinese adoptee to a white family, who goes to China with Lolo and “Deadeye,” her friend&#39;s cousin. Initially, she&#39;s there for a business deal, but thanks to Lolo&#39;s goading and a few comical circumstances, she ends up using the trip to find her birth mother. <em>Joy Ride</em> eventually serves us a tongue-in-cheek version of the familiar montage where Audrey seems to accept her quest: The gang rides on the back of a truck with locals before Audrey spins around, <em>Sound of Music</em> –style, in front of a mountain vista, declaring “I love China!” The sequence culminates in a raucous party at Lolo&#39;s grandmother&#39;s home, where the extended Chinese family welcome the friends with open arms.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/joy-ride-bottoms-raunchy-comedies/674691/">Read: More comedies with wild sex scenes, please</a><br><br> However, <em>Joy Ride</em> leans into its over-the-top sensibility and delivers these idealized sequences with a wink and a nudge. The viewer isn&#39;t meant to understand the “I heart China” montage as a simplistic form of character development. Instead, it&#39;s part of the film&#39;s larger setup, nudging audiences toward a gut punch. First, Audrey&#39;s blissful embrace of her personal journey is played comedically, as a reflection of her naivete. Then, when she&#39;s finally on the brink of meeting her birth mother, she isn&#39;t granted a sweeping realization of self-fulfillment. Instead, she&#39;s given surprising news about her heritage that changes the very premise of her search for an identity. Audrey doesn&#39;t return to the US with a convenient epiphany, but with more complications than she left with.<br><br> That sense of complex unfinished business is visible in other films with similar arcs that resist idealizing a homeland. Lulu Wang&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/07/farewell-lulu-wang-movie-review-awkwafina/593464/"><em>The Farewell</em></a> follows this narrative, as do smaller-scale films from European Asian filmmakers, such as Davy Chou&#39;s electric <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/02/return-to-seoul-movie-review/673127/"><em>Return to Seoul</em></a> and Hong Khaou&#39;s <em>Monsoon</em> . The main difference between these films and their flimsier counterparts is their ability to use a homecoming as a plot device but pointedly stop short of suggesting that it will solve all of the character&#39;s problems. In <em>The Farewell</em> , the story&#39;s focus is less on what the protagonist&#39;s return to China can offer her, and more on her navigation of grief across borders. In <em>Return to Seoul</em> , an adoptee&#39;s trips to South Korea are used to take an uncompromising look at her ambivalence and recklessness. <em>Monsoon</em> connects its main character&#39;s longing for home with his homoerotic longing. All of these films refuse to indulge in wish fulfillment.<br><br> <em>Joy Ride</em> is no different, and brings a subtle wisdom to an otherwise bawdy comedy. Audrey&#39;s core need is for belonging and acceptance. Instead of having her find it abroad, the film directs her to look to her friends who stood up for her on the playground or buoyed her through college. The idea of a pilgrimage leading you right back to the loved ones who have been there all along is also a common plotline in a girl&#39;s- or guy&#39;s-trip narrative. But given <em>Joy Ride</em> ’s cultural context, it acts as a clever undoing of the motherland trope. Audrey&#39;s friends are her redemption because they&#39;re part of the same complicated diaspora and know what it&#39;s like to struggle to belong in specific ways. Lolo&#39;s sex-positive artwork is unwelcome in the restaurant that her immigrant parents run; another friend, Kat, is desperately playacting celibacy to her highly religious Chinese fiancé despite her raunchy college past. These women ultimately needn&#39;t look for some kind of mythic belonging—they already belong to one another. By having its characters reach that realization, <em>Joy Ride</em> relinquishes the motherland of an obligation to solve everything, and underlines the transformative power of the relationships that we call home instead.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sat, 15 Jul 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/joy-ride-movie-asia-chinese-diaspora/674717/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/joy-ride-movie-asia-chinese-diaspora/674717/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Russia Has a New Gulag]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Moscow has revived the Soviet-era labor camp. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/H1TZce-E-6m-ZKob-s31lEruE4c=/0x0:8867x4988/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/AP23192663533575/original.jpg" alt="乌克兰伊齐乌姆的一间牢房" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Evgeniy Maloletka / AP</figcaption></figure> In 1978, Bohdan Klymchak walked out of the Soviet Union and asked for political asylum in Iran. Klymchak was Ukrainian, born near Lviv. In 1949, his family had been deported to Khabarovsk, in the Russian Far East, after the arrest of his brother as a “Ukrainian nationalist.” In 1957, Klymchak himself was arrested for “anti-Soviet agitation”; even after his release, he remained <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://museum.khpg.org/1142682865">under constant surveillance</a> . After he escaped across the border, and after the Iranians sent him back, Klymchak wound up in a camp called Perm-36, one of the last large political prisons in the Soviet Union. He remained there until 1990, as one of the last Soviet political prisoners.<br><br> In the three decades since Klymchak was freed, a lot has happened. Perm-36 became a thriving museum and site of remembrance, receiving tens of thousands of visitors, including groups of schoolchildren, every year. In 2014, it was shut down again. Russian ex-prisoners and historians published memoirs and histories of the Gulag, held conferences, created exhibitions, made documentaries. Then, over the past several years, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/putins-plot-against-russias-future/620930/">their organizations were banned</a> , and their leaders were exiled or ignored.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/ukraine-russia-war-consequences/673792/">Read: War and consequences</a><br><br> Today, a new version of that same Gulag system is being reconstructed, especially for Ukrainians. Journalists, war-crimes investigators, and specialized groups such as the Reckoning Project <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/russia-ukraine-war-potemkin-occupation-murder-torture/672841/">have already documented</a> arrests, murders, prisons, and torture chambers in Ukrainian territories under Russian occupation. Slowly, it is becoming clear that these are not just ad hoc responses to Ukrainian resistance. They are part of a long-term plan: the construction of a sprawling system of camps and punishment colonies—a new Gulag. The <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-prisons-civilians-torture-detainees-88b4abf2efbf383272eed9378be13c72">Associated Press reported</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-russia-prisons-civilians-torture-detainees-88b4abf2efbf383272eed9378be13c72">yesterday</a> that it has evidence of at least 40 prison camps in Russia and Belarus, as well as 63 formal and informal prisons in occupied Ukraine, containing perhaps 10,000 Ukrainians. A few are prisoners of war: Gulagu.net, a Russian prison-monitoring group, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gulagu.net/cases/voyna-v-ukraine">has evidence</a> of Ukrainian soldiers in Russian prisons who arrive without proper papers or POW status. But most of the Ukrainian prisoners are civilians who have been arrested or abducted in occupied territory.<br><br> As in the Gulag during its heyday, slave labor is one purpose of these camps. Some Ukrainians in captivity are being forced to dig trenches and build fortifications for Russian soldiers, and to dig mass graves. The Gulag was also designed to instill terror in the broader population, and the new camp system works that way too. Civilians are imprisoned and tortured for minor offenses—AP cites, as one example, the tying of a ribbon with Ukrainian colors to a bicycle—or sometimes for no reason at all. The Reckoning Project has collected many examples of Russian soldiers becoming paranoid and interrogating ordinary people, many of them volunteers for civic organizations, about their connections to the Ukrainian security services, the CIA, or even George Soros&#39;s Open Society Foundation. The AP describes one civilian captive from Ukraine&#39;s Zaporizhzhia region who was pulled from her cell, driven around town, and told to identify people with pro-Ukrainian sympathies. In 1937–38, during the era of the Great Purges, Soviet secret police were equally paranoid and equally terrified, not only of ordinary people but also of one another. Recent infighting suggests that Russian military forces may reach that stage in occupied Ukraine too.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/06/counteroffensive-ukraine-zelensky-crimea/673781/">From the June 2023 issue: The counteroffensive</a><br><br> Like the Soviet Gulag, the new Russian camp network is not temporary, and unless the Ukrainians can take back their territory, it will expand. AP has obtained a Russian document, dated this past January, that describes plans to build 25 new prison colonies and six detention centers in occupied Ukrainian territory by 2026. Like the Soviet Gulag, this system is chaotic and lawless. People have been condemned without trial. Their documents have been lost. Sometimes they are kept for no reason, or released for no reason. Their relatives receive no information about them and cannot find or contact them. Eventually, they may also be forced to the front lines. That is certainly the fate of Russian prisoners in Russia, many of whom are now told to sign mobilization papers, and beaten and tortured if they refuse. As in the old days, it seems as if Russian prison directors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.svoboda.org/a/32502251.html">have been given quotas</a> , numbers of prisoners they need to supply in order to fulfill some central plan.<br><br> The historical echoes can&#39;t be an accident. The KGB once taught new recruits to study the institution&#39;s history, and the Russian security services clearly do the same: They are carrying out repressive policies that “worked” in the Soviet days, that kept people like Bohdan Klymchak and his brother behind bars. But that history also explains Ukraine&#39;s response. Anyone who wonders why the Ukrainians keep fighting, why they keep asking for more weapons, why they become frustrated by slow-moving transatlantic diplomacy, why they seem angry or “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/why-zelensky-nato-membership-complaint-is-unreasonable">unreasonable</a> ,” should remember this: The Gulag was supposed to belong to the past. Now it belongs to the present. If Ukrainians don&#39;t want it to be part of their future, they will have to physically remove these camps—and the people who run them—from Ukrainian land. Until they have succeeded, no help will ever be enough.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 14 Jul 2023 16:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/russia-gulag-ukraine/674705/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/russia-gulag-ukraine/674705/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[And Just Like That Addresses Its Che Diaz Problem]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Midway through its second season, the <em>Sex and the City</em> reboot has given some unexpected depth to its most hated character. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/SBHCRiaUlqCALC2hYkKUaZ8KzJc=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/AJLT/original.jpg" alt="切·迪亚兹和米兰达·霍布斯在《就这样》" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Craig Blankenhorn / Max</figcaption></figure> <em><strong>This story contains spoilers through the fifth episode of</strong></em> <strong>And Just Like That</strong> <em><strong>Season 2.</strong></em><br><br> No one wearing a Harvard hoodie has ever looked as uncomfortable as Miranda Hobbes, the no-nonsense lawyer played by Cynthia Nixon, does in an episode from the first season of <em>Sex and the City</em> . In “Bay of Married Pigs,” Miranda agrees to be set up on a blind date at her firm&#39;s annual softball game. But when a colleague introduces Miranda to her would-be match, she realizes her peers have misjudged the reason for her lack of a boyfriend.

In Miranda&#39;s case, the partners at her firm gave her far more respect as a partnered lesbian than as a single straight woman, prompting her to pursue a fake relationship with Syd.

Some of its allure comes from the trajectory of Nixon&#39;s real-life romance: The actor split from her longtime male partner in 2003 and began dating the education activist Christine Marinoni as the original series ended. Since then, she&#39;s come out <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2012/01/30/cynthia-nixon-being-bisexual-not-choice#toggle-gdpr">as bisexual</a> , married Marinoni, and chosen to publicly identify <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/shes-here-shes-queer-and-cynthia-nixon-wants-you-to-get-used-to-it">as queer</a> . Even before news of a <em>Sex and the City</em> reboot was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.them.us/story/sex-and-the-city-reboot-miranda-bisexual">confirmed in 2021</a> , many queer fans hoped the series might revisit the possibility first raised at Miranda&#39;s softball game. Miranda, in some circles, was the show&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lofficielusa.com/pop-culture/sex-and-the-city-book-miranda-hobbes">most aspirational character</a> —the most levelheaded of the bunch, and the one most likely to admonish her friends for orienting their entire lives around men. She had long functioned as an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2022/tv/news/cynthia-nixon-miranda-sex-and-the-city-queer-lesbian-1235281614/">imperfect avatar for queer women</a> on a show whose <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2021/01/when-sex-and-the-city-returns-will-it-finally-get-queer-people-right">treatment of queerness</a> sometimes veered into <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/missmollymary/status/1678835592325660672">comically</a> offensive territory.<br><br> In the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/12/and-just-like-that-review-sex-and-city/620959/">first season of <em>And Just Like That</em></a> , the new series following three original <em>Sex and the City</em> characters, now in their 50s, Miranda did indeed get her queer story arc. But for many fans, the experience was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://medium.com/@allegrahirschman/miranda-was-always-already-queer-5708e198aee0">bittersweet</a> —in large part because of the love interest who kicks off her awakening. Miranda, still very much married to Steve (David Eigenberg), falls hard for the nonbinary stand-up comedian Che Diaz (Sara Ramírez), a polyamorous, pansexual agent of chaos who co-hosts <em>X, Y, and Me</em> , a podcast they describe as covering “gender roles, sexual roles, and cinnamon rolls.” The idea of a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cbc/video/7253475865772707078">repressed</a> , high-achieving lawyer having a midlife queer awakening isn&#39;t at all unfathomable—nor is the possibility that she might become enamored with a younger, pot-smoking provocateur. Still, though, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-pop-culture/agony-ecstasy-mirandas-coming-sex-city-reboot-rcna13213">Che really grated</a> . In their first scene, Che welcomed their two cisgender co-hosts onto the podcast by calling Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker) “Ms. Cis,” introduced themselves as a “queer, nonbinary, Mexican Irish diva representing everyone else outside these two boring genders,” then hit a button on the soundboard that punctuated the zinger with a loud “WOKE MOMENT!”<br><br> On a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/3NSBFcZpl5vZRrT5gsqFX7?si=d6159ba252cb47c5&amp;nd=1">recent episode</a> of Sam Sanders&#39;s podcast, <em>Into It</em> , one of the show&#39;s writers, Samantha Irby, compared Diaz to “the kind of person who turns a coffee order into a lesson in colonialism … Che is like that turned up to a 12.” Not since Jenny Schecter, the insufferable ingenue at the center of <em>The L Word</em> , has a fictional character so thoroughly vexed pretty much every queer person I know—and countless strangers whose <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/lyapalater/hey-its-che-diaz-jokes">tweets</a> , Instagram posts, and TikToks have crossed my screens. To quote one especially passionate review in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/obsessed/and-just-like-thats-che-diaz-is-the-worst-character-on-tv"><em>The Daily Beast</em></a> , “How unfortunate that a character like this is so heinous. No one <em>wants</em> to single out the only new LGBTQ+ character on a series as the worst. Yet Che Diaz leaves us no choice.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/06/and-just-like-that-season-2-review/674474/">Read: The ghost of a once era-defining show</a><br><br> I was surprised, then, to find myself feeling something akin to sympathy for Che in the most recent episode of <em>And Just Like That</em> . Season 1 ended with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/02/and-just-like-finale-miranda-che/621487/">Miranda uncharacteristically leaving</a> Steve, her friends, and an important career opportunity behind in order to follow Che to Los Angeles, where the comic is hoping to get the pilot of their semi-autobiographical coming-of-age sitcom green-lit. Whereas Che, in that first season, was a subject of easy parody, Season 2 makes it clear that the <em>And Just Like That</em> writers&#39; room wasn&#39;t pulling aimlessly from a grab bag of internet social-justice lingo. Beginning with Episode 5, which aired on Thursday, the show adds depth to Che—a welcome shift that also creates more room for Miranda to address some of the existential questions she&#39;s faced while imagining a future as Che&#39;s live-in cheerleader.<br><br> In that episode, co-written by Irby and Lucas Froehlich, Che watches a New York focus group give feedback on a test screening of the pilot for their show, <em>Che Pasa</em> . One member of the group, a young queer person of color, takes issue with the character based on Che, calling their storyline a “phony, sanitized, performative, cheesy-ass, dad-joke, bullshit version of what the nonbinary experience is.” (“It sucked,” they add for good measure.) The criticism immediately brings Che to tears, shattering their belief in the meaning of their life-defining work. When Miranda later tries to console them by saying the respondents don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about, Che brushes her off: “A genderqueer person from Brooklyn tanked it! That call came from inside the house.”<br><br> Che could have been replying directly to real-life audience complaints about them, but the exchange works because it allows us to see the potential for a real <em>character</em> to emerge from the caricature. Producing art of any kind is an intensely vulnerable process, all the more so when the work is autobiographical. For queer and trans people, and especially people of color, getting a big break in Hollywood often means contending with the industry&#39;s exhausting structural barriers and preference for easily reducible stereotypes. That type of feedback can be demoralizing, but it&#39;s expected. Intra-community judgment, however, hits much harder, making the criticism Che receives especially devastating. “It took me 46 years to figure out who I am,” Che tells Miranda, “and then a focus group one hour to fuckin&#39; destroy me.”<br><br> Part of what has made Che so maddening to watch up until this point is the extent to which the show itself seemed unsure of who their character is, and what role they play in the story of the three central women. In Season 1, Che was the younger foil to Carrie, who was cast as Che&#39;s prudish heterosexual counterpart on the podcast because she was uncomfortable with the paint-by-numbers jokes about queerness and the questions about sex. Charlotte (Kristin Davis) didn&#39;t really interact with Che, except to question why Miranda would blow up her relationship with Steve <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/nbc-out/out-pop-culture/agony-ecstasy-mirandas-coming-sex-city-reboot-rcna13213">almost overnight</a> . Che existed, it seemed, not just to show Miranda that she was unhappy in her marriage, but also to teach the trio about their privilege—acting as a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/24/arts/television/sex-and-the-city-girls-girlfriends-run-the-world.html">corrective to the original <em>Sex and the City</em></a> while expanding the sorts of lives the new series depicted.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2022/02/and-just-like-finale-miranda-che/621487/">Read: We need to talk about Miranda</a><br><br> That&#39;s a lot to put on one character. Nonbinary characters do exist on other shows, with storylines that are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/18/1056817713/sort-of-hbo-max-review">rich and complex</a> , but in the shadow of <em>Sex and the City</em> , a character like Che would&#39;ve always struggled to be perceived as anything other than the show&#39;s best approximation of what nonbinary people are like. In the original run, Carrie once referred to bisexuality as a “layover on the way to Gaytown.” So it&#39;s not hard to see why including a character who identifies as “an equal-opportunity confuser” on the reboot would be seen as an attempt at writing “catnip to … Gen Zers who identify outside of the binary,” as James Factora <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.them.us/story/and-just-like-that-mediocre-nonbinary-representation">wrote for <em>Them</em></a> in 2021.<br><br> Having the Gen X Che reckon with the limits of their story among younger queer people gives <em>And Just Like That</em> viewers the first real sign that the series doesn&#39;t think the comedian actually <em>does</em> stand in for their whole community. On <em>Into It</em> , Irby remarked that Che&#39;s pitched-up personality was “intentional.” In Season 2, though, “the artifice of Che starts to crumble.” We see that clearly in Irby and Froehlich&#39;s episode, but it continues throughout the next two episodes too. Without spoiling anything, Che&#39;s search for meaning brings them closer to Carrie, and pushes Miranda to explore her queerness with depth and curiosity rather than with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.salon.com/2023/07/09/and-just-like-that-miranda-che/">awkward, selfish impulsivity</a> .<br><br> By the seventh episode of the season, <em>And Just Like That</em> comes closer to fulfilling fans&#39; hopes for this new canonically queer Miranda, even if it hasn&#39;t quite reconciled her with the Miranda who recoiled from kissing Syd. Steve gets more space for his own complicated reactions to Miranda&#39;s journey, and to the dissolution of their <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thecut.com/2022/01/sex-and-the-citys-steve-deserves-better.html">beloved</a> , if <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://graziamagazine.com/us/articles/reconsidering-miranda-steve-sex-and-the-city/">sometimes rocky</a> , union. And Che, surprisingly, carves out a role in the troupe that feels more fleshed out than that of either the real-estate baddie Seema (Sarita Choudhury) or Miranda&#39;s graduate-school professor turned roommate, Nya (Karen Pittman). Thank goodness for that, because I&#39;m not sure I could handle even one more “WOKE MOMENT!”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 14 Jul 2023 14:37:49 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/and-just-like-that-che-diaz-character/674703/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/07/and-just-like-that-che-diaz-character/674703/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Drink More Water]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The dos and don&#39;ts of hydrating in a heat wave <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/kUl52UotDYjprRiWwOsW33o81Vk=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/07/survive_a_heatwave_horz_final/original.jpg" alt="水滴和水杯的拼贴画" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by The Atlantic.

Today, a third of Americans are under a heat alert as temperatures keep breaking records: Phoenix has hit 110 degrees Fahrenheit <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/us/phoenix-heat-wave.html">for two weeks straight</a> , while this weekend Death Valley in California <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/us/california-heat-wave.html">could surpass</a> the all-time high of 130 degrees.<br><br> Even less extreme heat than that can be dangerous. Recently, in Texas, Louisiana, part of Arizona, and Florida, there have been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/heat-deaths-dome-texas-california-south-d820a8782d3bc15abbe713af81dc7d7f">reports</a> of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.12news.com/article/news/local/hot-temperatures-have-led-to-8-deaths-10-burn-hospitalizations-officials-say-reporting-lags-numbers-will-soar/75-f6367179-0be1-4ced-af85-28c9e4445142">deaths</a> from heat, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/28/record-setting-texas-heat-sends-hundreds-emergency-rooms">many more</a> hospitalizations. The toll of a heat wave is not always clear in the moment: A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02419-z#Sec8">new report suggests tha</a> <u>t</u> last summer&#39;s historic heat wave in Europe killed more than 60,000 people.<br><br> Ideally, you&#39;d stay in the air-conditioned indoors as much as possible. That&#39;s not an option for everyone. The other thing to do is stay hydrated. The importance of getting enough fluid is hard to overstate—and often underappreciated: Last month, the Texas state legislature banned local governments from mandating water breaks for construction workers. In the heat, hydration “impacts everything,” Stavros Kavouras, the director of the Hydration Science Lab at Arizona State University, in Phoenix, told me. And with temperatures continuing to rise, it&#39;s essential to get it right.<br><br> Serious dehydration is really, really bad for you. Your blood volume decreases, which makes your heart work less effectively. “Your ability to thermoregulate declines,” Kavouras told me, “so your body temperature is getting higher and higher.” You might feel weak or dizzy. Your heart rate rises; it gets harder to focus. The worst-case scenario is heatstroke, when your body stops being able to cool itself—a  potentially fatal medical emergency.<br><br> In extreme temperatures, heat injuries can happen quicker than you might think. Given that the human body is mostly water, you might assume that there is some to spare, but inconveniently, this is not the case. “If you lose even 10 percent of [the water] your body has, you are entering the zone of serious clinical dehydration,” Kavouras said. “And if you look at <em>optimal</em> health, even losing just 1 percent of your body weight impacts your ability to function.” There are two basic ways your body cools itself when it gets hot. One is to send more blood to the skin, which releases heat from the core of your body, and is the reason you turn red when you&#39;re overheated. The other is to sweat. It evaporates off your body, and in the process, your body loses excess heat. You can&#39;t cool yourself as effectively if you&#39;re not properly hydrated. At the same time, one of your main cooling mechanisms is actively dehydrating, which means the goal is not just to <em>be</em> hydrated, but to stay that way.<br><br> What that takes depends on many factors rather than a single universal rule, but in general, the danger zone is “high humidity with anything above 90 degrees,” Kavouras said, at which point, “it&#39;s actually dangerous” just to be outside. The more active you are in the heat, and the hotter and more humid it is, the greater the risk—and the more important proper hydration becomes. The standard water target in the US during non-heat-wave times is 3.7 liters a day for men and 2.7 liters for women. When it&#39;s very, very hot out, you need more. Even if you spend most of the day in the bliss of AC, you are almost certainly leaving the house at <em>some</em> point.<br><br> Instead of trying to figure out what that precise amount should be, Kavouras recommends you focus on two things instead. “No. 1, keep water close to you. If you have water close to you, or whatever healthy beverage, you&#39;ll end up drinking more, just because it&#39;s closer,” he said. And second: Keep an eye on how often you pee—pale urine, six to seven times a day, or every two to three hours, is good. You want it to be “basically like a Chablis, a Riesling, Pinot Grigio, or champagne-colored,” John Higgins, a sports cardiologist at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, in Houston, told me. “If you notice the urine is getting darker, like a Chardonnay- or Sauvignon Blanc–type of thing, that generally means you are dehydrated.”<br><br> Certain groups are especially at risk. Older adults are more prone to dehydration, as are young children, people who are pregnant, and people taking certain medications—blood-pressure medications, for example. None of this requires you to take in <em>extra</em> fluids per se, just that you need to be even more careful that you&#39;re getting enough.<br><br> As for what to drink, as a go-to beverage, straight water is hard to beat. Water with fruit slices floating in it has the benefit of feeling like something from a luxury hotel. Carbonated water is also good—you might not be able to drink quite as much of it, which is a potential drawback, but “there is no mechanism in your GI system that will make sparkling water less effective at hydrating you,” Kavouras said. You probably want to avoid downing giant buckets of coffee—caffeine is a diuretic in large quantities and Higgins warns against sugary drinks for the same reason. (A daily iced coffee is fine.) If you&#39;re doing hours of heavy sweating, then you might work in some (less sugary) sports drinks. But for the majority of people, water remains the ideal. Food can also be a fluid source: “Make sure you&#39;re eating a diet that&#39;s rich in vegetables and fruits that have water content,” William Adams, the director of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro&#39;s Hydration, Environment and Thermal (HEAT) Stress Lab, advised. Alcohol, which causes you to <em>lose</em> fluid, is definitively unhelpful.<br><br> There are lots of water myths out there. Can you go too hard? Technically, it&#39;s possible to over-hydrate, causing an electrolyte imbalance, but all three experts agreed that for most people, this isn&#39;t really a concern. You can find <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2012/07/11/156378713/cool-down-with-a-hot-drink-its-not-as-crazy-as-you-think">arguments</a> for drinking hot drinks in the summer—the idea being that they increase the amount you sweat, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/a-hot-drink-on-a-hot-day-can-cool-you-down-1338875/">thereby promoting cooling</a> . But Kavouras is emphatic that you&#39;re better off with cold drinks, which cool your body, he said. In the moments before a race, marathon runners will sometimes take it one step further, slurping ice slurries to lower their body temperature. For good old-fashioned drinking water, about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261517517_Optimal_Composition_of_Fluid-Replacement_Beverages">50 degrees Fahrenheit</a> is best—roughly the temperature of cool water from the tap.<br><br> One final key to staying hydrated: Start early. A lot of people, Higgins said, are lightly dehydrated all the time, heat wave or not. “So particularly when you first wake up in the morning, typically you are in a dehydrated state.” Accordingly, he recommends that people drink about a standard water bottle&#39;s worth—roughly 17 ounces—as soon as they wake up. The other thing people forget about, he said, is what happens when they come back inside after enduring the outdoors. “You keep sweating,” he pointed out. In other words: hydrate, and then <em>keep</em> hydrating.<br><br> As crucial as hydration is, it is not a miracle. “It doesn&#39;t mean that you can say, &#39;I hydrate well, so I&#39;ll go out for a run in the 120-degree weather, and I&#39;ll be fine because I&#39;m drinking a lot,&#39;” Kavouras said. “It doesn&#39;t work this way.” Still, it is a simple but effective tool. As heat waves like this one become even more frequent, many more people will need to learn how to become attuned to their hydration. And perhaps adequate water can be a perverse sort of comfort: You can&#39;t control the unrelenting heat, but you likely can control your water intake. In a heat wave, it helps to have a glass-half-full attitude—and an emptied glass of water.<br><br> <small><em>This story is part of the Atlantic Planet series supported by HHMI&#39;s Science and Educational Media Group.</em></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 14 Jul 2023 13:29:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/the-dos-and-donts-of-hydrating-in-a-heat-wave/674704/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/07/the-dos-and-donts-of-hydrating-in-a-heat-wave/674704/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Is a Glass of Wine Harmless?

In a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blog.iwfs.org/2014/08/french-paradox-how-a-60-minutes-segment-transformed-red-wine-consumption-in-america/">1991 segment on <i>60 Minutes</i></a> , a French researcher <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njm1LkXP2sg">claimed</a> that red-wine consumption was responsible for good health in France. This argument proved popular with the wine-consuming public, and prompted academic <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/014067369190542W">papers</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/310/6988/1165.short">positing</a> an inverse relationship between red-wine consumption and cardiovascular disease. Scientists even put forward a mechanistic theory for why red wine was healthy, involving a compound <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://europepmc.org/article/med/7499059">called resveratrol</a> .<br><br> Others soon cast doubt on the possibility that red wine could really have any causal relationship with longevity. The “alcohol is good for you” narrative eroded and, in the past year, seems to have fully collapsed. A number of researchers are now arguing that basically <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://time.com/5376552/how-much-alcohol-to-drink-study/"><i>any</i> amount</a> of alcohol is bad for you; a <i>New York Times</i> article from January was titled “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/13/well/mind/alcohol-health-effects.html">Even a Little Alcohol Can Harm Your Health</a> .” Some— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ccsa.ca/canadas-guidance-alcohol-and-health">including the Canadian government</a> —are suggesting that, as a result, the safest choice is not to drink <i>at all</i> .<br><br> Excessive alcohol consumption clearly leads to significant problems, physical and emotional. That is not up for debate. However: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DkS1pkKpILY">Recent</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wellness/2023/03/31/moderate-drinking-alcohol-wine-risks/">rhetoric</a> , veering in the direction of abstinence, goes well beyond the sound advice to avoid heavy drinking and ignores the value of pleasure.<br><br> <a href="http://v/">Read: A daily drink is almost certainly not going to hurt you</a><br><br> A pleasure-agnostic approach to health advice is now in vogue even outside the domain of alcohol, and is filtering down to the general public with sometimes absurd results. Recently, a reader asked me: <i>Is there any data on health benefits to orgasms?</i> I am not aware of reliable data from randomized experiments suggesting that having more orgasms improves health. That isn&#39;t the point of orgasms, anyway. The point of orgasms is that they are fun. We do not need to prove health benefits to want to have them.<br><br> Public-health advice is sometimes based on a “lexicographic” standard—putting the effects on health first, second, and third, and ignoring other considerations, including enjoyment. A lexicographic standard applied to, say, meat consumption would hold that we must always eat burgers well done, because that is the best way to avoid any risk of <i>E. coli</i> , even though well-done burgers are tasteless. More generally, some in public health avoid discussing the negative unintended consequences of absolutism. During the coronavirus pandemic, some officials advocated strongly for long-lasting school closures, arguing that keeping kids at home was the only way to prevent in-school spread among students and teachers. That was, in a technical sense, true, but this recommendation failed to consider the enormous costs to children of those closures, which should have been weighed against any benefits.<br><br> Coming back to alcohol, pleasure-agnosticism could make sense if the best available evidence indicated <i>substantial</i> harm from even moderate drinking. It does not. I should also stress that the data are fundamentally flawed because the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28735-5">largest</a> , most commonly cited studies we have are observational, not randomized. And the characteristics of people who consume alcohol in moderation are different from those who do not.<br><br> In 2018, <i>The Lancet</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thelancet.com/article/S0140-6736(18)31310-2/fulltext">published a comprehensive study</a> on the link between alcohol consumption and cancer, heart disease, and other illnesses. It is an extraordinary work of scholarship, combining hundreds of previous papers. And the results indicate an upward trend in cancer, in particular, as alcohol consumption increases. But the effects at moderate levels of drinking—say, one to two drinks a day— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2018/08/there-is-a-safe-level-of-alcohol/568531/">are very small</a> . For heart disease, we see the familiar <i>decrease</i> in risk at moderate drinking levels, and an increase with higher amounts.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/07/america-drinking-alone-problem/619017/">From the July/August 2021 issue: America has a drinking problem</a><br><br> <i>None of these results are convincingly causal</i> .<i> </i>It seems very likely that all associations—positive and negative—are overstated relative to the truth. Generally, when researchers are able to adjust for some demographic differences, the relationship between alcohol and health gets smaller. This, in turns, suggests that if they could <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07350015.2016.1227711">adjust for more differences</a> , it would get smaller still. Whether these relationships would be smaller but still positive, or really zero, is something we cannot know from the data we have.<br><br> We cannot conclusively prove that moderate alcohol consumption is totally benign, much less beneficial. Based on the data we have, it also seems extremely unlikely that moderate alcohol consumption is fully “bad” for your health.<br><br> If you do not enjoy, or actively dislike, alcohol, then the abstinence standard might be the right one for you. But many people do enjoy a drink from time to time: a beer with friends, a cold glass of rosé in the summer, a hot toddy in front of the fire, even just a glass of white wine while cooking at the end of a long day. If we accept that pleasure has value, and that the data are muddy, then the moderation standard makes more sense.<br><br> The pendulum on alcohol has swung too far from the 1990s. Alcohol is probably not the key to longevity. But it&#39;s not arsenic, either.

In Phoenix, Arizona, the temperature has <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.azfamily.com/2023/07/12/110-streak-continues-with-hottest-weekend-summer-ahead/">broken 110 degrees</a> for nearly two weeks running.

In the Northeast, floods have put towns <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/11/us/vermont-flooding-damage-rescues.html">underwater</a> , erased <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/AlexRuane/status/1678484215036354560?s=20">entire roadways</a> , and left train tracks eerily <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://weather.com/news/trending/video/floods-leave-train-tracks-hanging-in-vermont">suspended</a> 100 feet in the air. Also, the sea ice in Antarctica—which should be expanding rapidly right now, because, remember, it&#39;s winter down there—may be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/">losing mass</a> .<br><br> In one sense, this pile-up of crises is exactly what climate scientists expected. Global temperatures are rising at pretty much the anticipated rate, Simon Lee, an atmospheric scientist at Columbia University, told me, and natural disasters are corollaries to that fact. There will be some year-to-year variation in what happens—and this one may clock in with slightly worse conditions, overall, than trend lines would predict. But the fact is, climate change is implicated at least to some extent in all of these disasters. It makes the hot days hotter. It makes rainstorms more intense. It dries out landscapes and primes them for ignition. “We don&#39;t need to do a specific attribution study anymore” to make such assertions, Gavin Schmidt, a climatologist and the director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told me. “We&#39;ve been doing this for 20 years now … This is so far from rocket science.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/climate-change-heat-waves-ocean-sea-level-rise/674676/">Read: Boiling the ocean</a><br><br> But when it comes to climate science, what researchers “expect” can be a sketchy concept. “We know the overall path we&#39;re on,” Alex Ruane, a climate scientist at NASA, told me, but “things don&#39;t always change in a nice, gradual way.” Although the global situation is deteriorating at about the rate that leading models would predict, more specific, local changes may come as a surprise. Climate change is, at its core, a destabilizing force: Think of its effects as being predictably unpredictable. The total surface area of the Antarctic sea ice, for example, is currently more than <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/">four standard deviations</a> smaller than the average for this time of year. That&#39;s not just breaking the record since measurements began in the 1970s; that&#39;s <em>shattering</em> the record. Why exactly this has happened now—and whether it will end up as a terrifying blip or a permanent state—is still an open question. Likewise, scientists do not yet fully understand how climate change affects the way that weather systems move across the globe. A storm may be diverted from a drought-stricken region to an already sodden town, or a scorching atmosphere may stall out in a single place, as we&#39;re seeing with the heat dome that has settled over Phoenix.<br><br> Even if those disasters do play out exactly as expected, the scientists I spoke with said they&#39;ve noticed shifts in how Americans are discussing them. “People are no longer talking about climate change in the future tense,” Ruane said. “They&#39;re talking about climate change in the present tense.” More and more of them have personal tales of climate woe. Disasters are no longer framed as harbingers; they&#39;re simply understood to be the way things are. “These are not canaries in the coal mine,” Schmidt said. “The canaries died a long time ago.”<br><br> Back when he worked at <em>The Atlantic</em> , my former colleague Robinson Meyer would end his weekly newsletter with a section called “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/04/an-outdated-idea-is-still-shaping-climate-policy/618652/">Someone Else&#39;s Weather</a> ,” because, as he put it, “the climate is someone else&#39;s weather.” I always took this to mean that the abstraction we refer to as the climate is a concrete, imminent reality for someone, <em>somewhere</em> . It&#39;s the sky above their head, the earth beneath their feet, the feeling of the air around them.<br><br> This year&#39;s accumulating catastrophes reinforce this formulation, but they also take it one step further. The heat and the fires and the melting and the floods all contribute to a growing sense that climate change is happening right here and now—that the climate truly has become the weather. We <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/heat-dome-southwest-arizona/674689/">stay in</a> because it&#39;s hot. We take a different route to work because the roads have been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/cavendish-vermont-climate-change-storm-new-england/674682/">washed out</a> . We adjust our plans because of wildfire smoke in the same way that we&#39;ve always done for bouts of lightning and rain. More and more, the climate is not someone else&#39;s weather. It&#39;s our own.<br><br> Hanna Rosin speaks with the climate writer Emma Pattee on how extreme heat is already changing our kids&#39; summers.

But today&#39;s state of the art in artificial intelligence is already auguring smaller but still shattering scenarios.<br><br> Some people so deeply yearn to climb Mount Everest that they prepare for years, spend vast sums of money, exhaust themselves for weeks in the climb itself, and repeatedly put their lives at risk. Does that sound like you? Or would you rather just land on its summit in a helicopter and feast yourself on the great view? And what about scaling the <em>metaphorical</em> Everest of a foreign language? Two small episodes in my life in the past month led me to serious musings along these lines.<br><br> Two weeks ago, I watched, for the first time ever, a video of myself back in 2018 in Hangzhou, China, as I struggled mightily for three minutes to make a few off-the-cuff remarks to about 20 young people from Shanghai who belonged to a club of AI enthusiasts. They had traveled 200 miles to Hangzhou to meet me for dinner, and for two and a half hours we had spoken only English together, but toward the evening&#39;s end they asked me if I wouldn&#39;t mind saying something very brief <em>in Chinese</em> for those club members who hadn&#39;t been able to make the trip. Uh-oh! Panic city! Even though I had devoted many arduous years to the study of Chinese (always thinking of the daunting phrase “Learning Chinese is a five-year lesson in humility” as a ridiculous understatement), and had worked like the devil during the previous three months in Hangzhou, I was caught way off guard by their request and, although in the end I obliged them, I felt super jittery while doing so. Shortly thereafter they sent me the video, but for all these years I hadn&#39;t dared to look at even the opening few seconds of it, so scared was I of seeing myself linguistically stumble all over the place.<br><br> But what I saw, when I finally dared to watch myself very recently, was surprising. I saw a person who was not just struggling hard to express himself in a very difficult alien tongue, but who was actually doing a fairly decent job of it, while at the same time coming across as insecure and vulnerable, yet courageously willing to take the bull by the horns. In short, today&#39;s me felt proud of my 2018 self! Since that day five years ago, sadly, my once-okay Chinese has gone to the dogs, and today I couldn&#39;t give a three-minute talk in Chinese to save my life, so I&#39;m thrilled to have proof that at one time in my life, I was actually able to wing it, actually able to give a tiny “talk” in Chinese, even if only a three-minute one.<br><br> So that&#39;s the first episode; here&#39;s the other. A few weeks ago, my very dear Italian friend Benedetto Scimemi passed away, and I spent hours writing heartfelt emails of condolence to all the members of his family. It happens that I lived in Italy for nearly three years and, on top of that, my two children and I have spoken Italian for 30 years as our family language, so my Italian is very fluent and comfortable—but, even so, it is not the Italian of a native speaker. In writing those difficult and emotional emails, I was constantly adjusting my words and phrases, lovingly remembering Benedetto and all the wonderful things we had done together, and pushing my Italian to its very limits. It took me perhaps two or three times as long as it would have taken me in English, but I did it with all my heart. I looked up lots of words in the big, heavy dictionary that I always keep right by my computer, and I felt my words were really <em>me</em> ; my caring concentration on each and every turn of phrase made them mirror my feelings of love for my late friend in the most intensely personal way. Once again I was proud of myself and of the manner in which, over decades, I had come to be able to express myself clearly, strongly, and with a deeply felt voice in a tongue that was not my mother tongue.<br><br> Over the course of my life, I have studied lots of languages to various degrees, and I jokingly call myself “pilingual,” meaning that if you were to add up the fractional levels of mastery of all the languages I&#39;ve tackled, you&#39;d get a number a bit over three, counting English as one, French as 0.8, Italian as 0.7, and going down from there, with Chinese as maybe 0.3, at its apex (probably just 0.1 today).<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/07/generative-ai-human-culture-philosophy/674165/">Read: The coming human renaissance</a><br><br> Leaving aside my native tongue, I have devoted many thousands of hours of my life to seven languages (French, Italian, German, Swedish, Russian, Polish, and Chinese)—sometimes flailing desperately and sometimes finding enormous gratification. But through thick and thin, I have relentlessly bashed my head against each of those languages for years, because I love each one&#39;s sounds, words, intonation patterns, idioms, proverbs, poetry, songs, and so on. It&#39;s hard to think of anything else, in the world of the mind, that has pulled me as intensely as my craving to internalize the magic logic of an alien tongue from a faraway place.<br><br> But today we have Google Translate. Today we have DeepL. Today we have ChatGPT—and so on. There&#39;s no need for me to list all the powerful technologies that allow anyone today—a monolingual American, say, who has never devoted a single moment to learning, say, Chinese—to write fluent passages in Chinese. Today it&#39;s a piece of cake to send an email in a tongue you don&#39;t know a word of. You just click on “Translate” and presto!就在那里！ Or at least, there it is, in a certain sense. Assuming that there are no egregious translational blunders (which there often still are), what you are sending off is slick but soulless text.<br><br> Just imagine if the Shanghai AI club had asked me to say a few words for the club&#39;s absent members not in Chinese but in English, and then, while I was speaking, they ran my English words through a speech-transcribing app, then a translation app, then a speech-producing app, so that my English words came out <em>, in real time,</em> in Chinese. (In fact, if this were happening today, the speech-producing app could even use my very own voice, speaking with a perfect Mandarin accent!) Had the club gone that techie-type route, which they might well have liked to do, we could have bypassed any need for me to struggle and strain to express myself in their tongue. For both me and the club members, it would have been effortless.<br><br> However, in this scenario, the video watchers would be deprived of coming to know key aspects of the very human personality of their invitee. They would not see Douglas Hofstadter (known in Chinese as “Hou Daoren”) groping for Chinese words, would not witness his insecurity, his vulnerability, or, for that matter, his dogged determination; they would merely see an American casually speaking in his native tongue (though what they would <em>hear</em> is perfect Chinese); they would get no sense for the <em>real</em> me, who had devoted thousands of hours, spread out over many years, to grappling with their native tongue. My <em>ideas</em> would come across, more or less, but not those hidden aspects of my <em>self</em> .<br><br> But let me play devil&#39;s advocate for a moment. Today&#39;s AI technology allows people of different cultures to communicate instantly and effortlessly with one another.哇！ Isn&#39;t that a centuries-long dream come true, weaving the world ever more tightly together? Isn&#39;t it a wonderful miracle? Isn&#39;t the soon-to-arrive world where everyone can effortlessly speak every language just glorious?<br><br> Some readers will certainly say “yes,” but I would say “no.” In fact, I see this looming scenario as a great tragedy. I see it as the beginning of the end of the age-old tradition of learning foreign languages—not only here in America, but even in lands like Holland and Sweden, fabled for their citizens&#39; near-universal mastery of several tongues. The problem is that people of all cultures instinctively follow the path of least resistance.<br><br> Why would anyone want to devote thousands of hours to learning a foreign language if, by contrast, they could simply talk into their cellphone and it would instantly spit out “the same message” in any language of their choice, in their own voice, and with a perfect accent to boot? Who wouldn&#39;t want to be able to have complex conversations with anyone they wish, in any country, no matter what language it involves? Why bother to take countless courses in Chinese and still feel deeply inadequate in it when, in a flash, you can communicate not only in Chinese but also in French, Hungarian, Swahili, and so on?<br><br> Suppose I had composed my condolences to Benedetto&#39;s family in English and had then run them through a translation program such as DeepL. The words would have come out very differently from what I wrote in Italian. When I was <em>writing</em> in Italian, I was <em>thinking</em> in Italian, not in English. I was using words and phrases that I have made my own over decades, by having countless intimate conversations with close Italian friends (such as Benedetto himself), by reading hundreds of children&#39;s books in Italian to my kids when they were little tykes, by listening hundreds of times to CDs of lilting Italian songs from the 1930s, by devouring Italian newspapers, by giving untold dozens of lectures in Italian, by watching scores of old Italian movies, by memorizing a few Italian poems, and so on. All that unique flavor, reflecting the myriad idiosyncratic pathways by which I lovingly internalized the Italian language, would be missing from an email that I composed in English and that was instantly converted into Italian by a machine.<br><br> You might say that such a loss is a small price to pay—a <em>teeny</em> price to pay!—for the amazing luxury of being able to produce flawless, flowing emails in a hundred different languages, the luxury of being able to give lectures in real time in a hundred different languages, and so forth and so on. Well, I would reply that the “you” who is “writing” or “speaking” so fluently in all these different languages is not <em>you</em> at all. It is, rather, a deepfake version (or a set of deepfake versions) of you.<br><br> When I was in the roughest times in my endless battles with the Chinese language, I often wished that I could just get an injection that would make me perfectly fluent in Chinese in a flash. How wonderful it would be to be able, at last, to understand everyone around me, to say anything I wanted to say, and so on! But when I thought about it for only a few seconds, I realized that after getting such an injection, I would not feel <em>proud</em> of having learned Chinese by struggling for many years. My instant fluency in Chinese would, in that case, be a trivial acquisition rather than a precious goal obtained thanks to immense hard work. It would mean nothing to me, emotionally. It would be like arriving at the summit of Everest in a helicopter. It would be like taking a new wonder drug that hugely boosted my muscles and hugely sped up my reflexes, making me (even at age 78!) suddenly able to run faster than anyone else in the world. Next thing you know, this old geezer would be winning a gold medal in the Olympic 400 meters. But big deal! “My” gold medal would be a hollow victory proving nothing about my athletic abilities. It would be purely the result of technological cheating. Likewise, my Chinese-fluency injection would be a hollow victory, because “my” Chinese would not in any way represent my very human, very fallible, but also very determined mind and spirit.<br><br> When, in my teenage years, I was striving so passionately to learn French, I sometimes wished that I had just grown up in France with my American parents, so that both French and English were 100 percent native to me. But when I thought about it more carefully, I realized that the reason I was so in love with French was precisely that it was <em>not</em> my mother tongue, and that if it had been, then I wouldn&#39;t be able to hear it in anything like the same way I heard it <em>as an outsider.</em><br><br> Of course, over my six-plus decades of speaking French, I have become less and less of an outsider to it, but still I have somehow preserved the intense love that came from confronting the huge challenge of <em>making French my own</em> in my teenage years, as opposed to simply imbibing it like mother&#39;s milk, as a small child. And I am oh so proud of myself if, after half an hour&#39;s conversation, my native-French interlocutor is startled to learn that I did not grow up speaking French. By dint of intense concentration over decades, I&#39;ve <em>earned</em> that supreme compliment, and knowing I&#39;ve reached that long-dreamed-for level thanks to my years of really hard work is as great a feeling as any I have ever had.<br><br> Today&#39;s young people (even in Holland and Sweden) who grow up with translation software, however, will not be lured in the same way that I, as a teenager, was lured by the fantastic, surrealistic goal of internalizing another language. They won&#39;t feel the slightest temptation to devote a major fraction of their lives to slowly and arduously acquiring the sounds, vocabulary, grammar, and cultural richness of another language. To them, someone with my self-punishing attitude would seem hopelessly wedded to the past. Why on earth cling to riding a horse or a bicycle for transportation, when you can drive a car (not to mention flying in an airplane)? What&#39;s the point of going super slowly when you can go superfast? Okay, okay, on a horse or bicycle you&#39;ll see the scenery a bit better, but is it really worth it, when you can cross an entire continent in hours or days, instead of in weeks or months?<br><br> The question comes down to why we humans use language at all. Isn&#39;t the purpose of language just the communication of facts? If so, then why not simply go for maximizing the number of facts transferred per second? Well, to me, this sounds like a shockingly utilitarian and pragmatic description of what I view as a perpetually astonishing and quasi-magical phenomenon that lies at the very core of conscious life.<br><br> When I speak any language, as all my friends know well, I am always searching for the most appropriate word or idiom, frequently hesitating, stumbling, or suddenly changing course midstream; constantly joking by playing with ambiguity; having fun by putting on droll accents and personas, not to mention coming out with puns (some lovely, some lousy); using alliterative phrases; concocting new words on the fly; making accidental mistakes and laughing at myself; committing deliberate grammatical errors; unconsciously blending idioms and thus creating delightful new turns of phrase; tossing in words from other languages left and right; citing proverbs and quoting snippets of poetry; mixing metaphors; etc., etc. Speaking any language, for me, is a living, dynamic process that is permeated by my own unique humanness, with all its frailties and strengths. How is all of this wildly bubbling richness in Language A going to be mirrored in real time in Language B by a mechanical device that has nothing of those qualities driving it, that has no sense of humor, that has no understanding of irony or self-mockery, that has no awareness of how phrases are unconsciously blended, and so on?<br><br> For me, using language is the very essence of being human. When I speak, I am communicating not only <em>facts</em> , but a <em>way of being</em> . Through my word choices and subtle intonations and tiny hesitations and droll puns and dumb errors (and so on), I am revealing <em>who I am.</em> I am not a <em>persona</em> , but a <em>person</em> .<br><br> Today, though, it strikes me as possible—in fact, quite likely—that humans are collectively going to knuckle under and throw in the towel as far as foreign languages are concerned. Are we language users going to obsequiously hand over all engagement with other tongues to chatbots? Will young people in the coming decades share my youthful ardent desire to tackle towering linguistic Everests demanding long years of dedication? Or will they opt for the helicopter/chatbot pathway, preferring their linguistic lives to be struggle-free? If everything we might ever wish for is just handed to us gratis on a silver platter, then what, I wonder, is the purpose of living?<br><br> As my friend David Moser put it, what may soon go down the drain forever, thanks to these new AI technologies, is the precious gift that one can gain only by immersing oneself deeply in another culture and thereby acquiring an entirely new set of ways of looking at the world. It&#39;s a gift that can&#39;t help but turn any human being into a far richer and broader one. But David fears that it may soon become as rare as hen&#39;s teeth. And, I might add, David knows perfectly whereof he speaks, because in his 30s he recklessly threw himself into the bustling, boiling cauldron of China and its mysterious languages, and after long years of tenaciously clambering up its nearly vertical slopes (sorry for the mixed metaphor!), he emerged as a marvelously fluent speaker of Chinese, able to come out with breathtakingly witty puns on the fly and to do stand-up comedy on national television, not to mention hosting his own weekly TV show, in Chinese, about little-known facets of Beijing.<br><br> To Mo Dawei, as David is known in China, it&#39;s incredibly depressing to contemplate the profound impoverishment of people&#39;s mental and emotional lives that is looming just around every corner of the globe, thanks to the slick seductiveness of AI translation apps, insidiously creeping their way into ordinary people&#39;s lives and sapping their desire to make other tongues their own.<br><br> When children first hear the sounds of another language, they can&#39;t help but wonder: <em>What in the world would it feel like to speak that language?</em> Such eager childlike curiosity might seem universal and irrepressible. But what if that human curiosity is suddenly snuffed out forever by the onrushing tsunami of AI? When we collectively abandon the age-old challenge of learning the languages of other lands, when we relinquish that challenge to ultrarapid machines that have no inner life of their own but are able to give us fluent but fake facades in other languages, then we will have lost a major part of what it is to be human and alive.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 13 Jul 2023 13:56:56 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/the-terrible-downside-of-ai-language-translation/674687/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/the-terrible-downside-of-ai-language-translation/674687/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Four Ways to Make Grief More Bearable]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Losing a loved one inevitably brings pain.

He found it comforting to do so. A year later, when the earthquake and tsunami that overwhelmed the Fukushima nuclear power plant killed almost 20,000 people in his country—including about 10 percent of the population of his own town—Sasaki opened his <i>kaze no denwa</i> , or “wind phone,” to the public. The booth has received more than 30,000 visitors to date, initially those who used it to “talk” with their family and friends who&#39;d been killed in the disaster but now almost anyone grieving the loss of a loved one, including tourists.<br><br> Grief can create a psychological, even physiological, disequilibrium so great that even a simulated phone connection can provide relief. And yet, grief is the most natural kind of suffering. We love others, and we will lose some of them. That&#39;s part of life: Given that nearly 3 million people die in the US every year, and each leaves, on average,<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/200995">an estimated five people bereaved</a> , almost 15 million Americans annually are experiencing fresh grief. Scholars believe that a more severe form, known as<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3384440/"> </a>prolonged grief, afflicts about one in 10 bereaved people a year; this describes a condition in which the mourner&#39;s suffering remains high over an extended period.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/03/finding-joy-happiness-in-absurd-boredom-stress/673248/">Arthur C. Brooks: How to find joy in your Sisyphean existence</a><br><br> Grief does not have to be a private misery and net harm to our lives. We can learn to comprehend it, manage it, and grow from it. And in understanding our own grief, we can help others heal and thrive as well.<br><br> W <span class="smallcaps">e often use</span> <i>bereavement</i> and <i>grief</i> synonymously, but they aren&#39;t the same. Bereavement is the experience of losing a loved one to death, whereas grief is the physical, psychological, and social response to that experience. This sort of sadness comes to every one of us, yet the experience is still shrouded in mystery. For many, the only thing they know about the science of grief is that it is thought to involve passing through five predictable stages—denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. And this conventional wisdom, based on the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.psy.lmu.de/allg2/download/audriemmo/ws1011/kubler-ross.pdf">work</a> of the Swiss American psychiatrist Elisabeth Kübler-Ross and her colleagues dating from the late 1960s, has been largely abandoned by experts in recent decades.<br><br> Nevertheless, medical providers do <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://in.bgu.ac.il/en/fohs/communityhealth/Family/Documents/Complicated%20Grief.pdf">see</a> fairly common symptoms of grief, especially in the period right after a person learns of a loved one&#39;s death. The effects that typically occur are part of the “separation response,” which includes yearning, longing, and sadness but also commonly involves benign hallucinations of the loved one. This can also entail <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Thomas-Fuchs-6/publication/316013243_Presence_in_absence_The_ambiguous_phenomenology_of_grief/links/5a5b1414aca2727d60869f36/Presence-in-absence-The-ambiguous-phenomenology-of-grief.pdf">confusion</a> about your sense of self and of your relationship to others, if they emerged through deep intertwinement with the deceased, and even disorientation about what is past and present. For this reason, acute grief can resemble mild dementia, though of course it is not the same. Rather, the condition occurs because another person can be such a part of ourselves that when they disappear, we are temporarily destabilized in our sense of time and space.<br><br> Neuroscientists are learning about the brain&#39;s response to grief, which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24923337/">involves</a> (among other regions) activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, a part of the brain associated with the experience of pain, both physical and psychological. One way researchers measure physical arousal caused by grief is by how well the skin conducts electricity (known as “skin conductance response”), which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2695635/#:~:text=The%20skin%20conductance%20response%20(SCR)%20is%20an%20indirect%20measure%20of,emotional%20valence%20(Bradley%20et%20al.">indicates</a> the intensity of emotion and attention. Researchers of a small neuroanatomical study published in <i>The</i> <i>American Journal of Psychiatry</i> in 2003 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/doi/pdf/10.1176/appi.ajp.160.11.1946">reported</a> that this response was highest among the bereaved when grief-related words were accompanied by a photo of the deceased loved one, and much higher than if the subject was prompted by just one reminder or the other.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/12/breakup-heartbreak-moving-on-shorten-pain/672391/">Arthur C. Brooks: Breakups always hurt, but you can shorten the suffering</a><br><br> Given how debilitating grief can be, especially early on, it might seem like some sort of evolutionary glitch. Yet evolutionary biologists <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/culturing-science/the-evolution-of-grief-both-biological-and-cultural-in-the-21st-century/">believe</a> just the opposite. Staying close to kin was a survival imperative until relatively recently, so the pain of separation from someone very close was an important inducement to close that gap; failing to do so could mean dangerous isolation. Unfortunately, the death of a loved one means that that pain of separation cannot be relieved immediately and lessens only with time, as our brains become more accustomed to life without the person who has died.<br><br> For most people, that pain <i>does</i> decline with time. One way that researchers have measured this is by looking at the prevalence of depressive symptoms in successive months after the death of a loved one. One 2019 study of widowed women <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-019-01680-3">found</a> that depression was present in 38 percent within the first month; through the next two months, it was present in 25 percent; a year to a year and a half later, it was affecting 11 percent. Notably, there was a great deal of heterogeneity in the samples studied—everyone has a different experience of grief. Yet the data show that although people never forget their lost loved ones, most of the bereaved recover significantly in a matter of months.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">s difficult as</span> things can seem early on after the loss of a loved one, you can be happy again. In fact, a large body of research shows that over time, bereavement can even be an impetus for what psychologists <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Christina-Michael/publication/260244829_Post-traumatic_growth_following_bereavement_A_systematic_review_of_the_literature/links/00b495346ecbb5a1ca000000/Post-traumatic-growth-following-bereavement-A-systematic-review-of-the-literature.pdf">call</a> post-traumatic growth, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.apa.org/monitor/2016/11/growth-trauma">including</a> greater appreciation for life, improved relationships, recognition of new possibilities, personal strength, and spiritual development.这里有四种方法可以让悲伤在早期变得更容易忍受，并让悲伤在以后更加明显地增长。<br><br> <strong>1. Look for meaning</strong><br> In the 1990s, researchers at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst interviewed college students who had recently lost a parent. The scholars asked the students about, among other things, their sense of meaning in the world: how just the world is, how random, how controllable. The researchers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/abs/10.1521/jscp.1991.10.3.270">found</a> that bereavement was significantly lower among the students who scored higher in their belief in a world with meaning. This suggests that a good course of action in a time of grief is to use the experience as an opportunity to ponder your beliefs and look for answers about life&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/10/meaning-life-macronutrients-purpose-search/620440/">coherence, purpose, and significance</a> . So it also makes sense that spiritual and religious progress are a common source of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-07744-001">growth</a> after bereavement.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C.

Make changes to your identity</strong><br> When a loved one dies, that changes who you are—at a minimum in a purely factual way. For instance, the loss of a spouse means that you are now single. More than that, though, when you lose a loved one, it brings a change in your own identity, along with all sorts of behavioral changes. Single people, after all, do different things than married people. A 2013 review of older adults who&#39;d experienced bereavement <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0020748912004282?casa_token=ixKh7nfEbckAAAAA:mxhJe6tdeGKNDy6QWHsArhMuAaR3zLiq0Z-2vMaIV2RjpfH056FOq5rtEYe1wGF2DEIxRVFZlQ">found</a> that after they&#39;d lost someone, an essential factor of recovery included consciously embracing a new identity and making life changes. The lives they made involved going out more with friends, for example, or getting into new activities. Although grief is painful, it is also an opportunity to become a new person.<br><br> <strong>3. Adopt rituals</strong><br> One way of reestablishing a sense of control after the loss of a loved one is to create mourning rituals; even trivial-seeming ones can be effective. Researchers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/norton%20gino%202014_e44eb177-f8f4-4f0d-a458-625c1268b391.pdf">demonstrated</a> this in an experiment published in the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology</i> in which people who had lost an important relationship through a breakup or death were asked to recall rituals related to the loss. For some, the rites were religious, such as sitting shiva; others played a favorite song on particular days or wrote letters to the loved one that they never sent. Those who remembered a ritual experienced 10 percent less grief than those who did not. When the researchers induced grief in a laboratory through randomly losing a lottery and then testing the impact of rituals in isolation regardless of belief, they found that these behaviors reduced grief intensity by 28 percent. The right practice for you will depend on your beliefs and circumstances, but it will help to do something systematic that acknowledges your loss and puts you in charge of your response.<br><br> <strong>4. Let yourself be happy again</strong><br> Specialists in the subject commonly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pathwayshealth.org/grief-support/is-it-ok-to-be-happy-during-grief/">point out</a> that grief can be accompanied by guilt when grief starts to subside, as if this were a signal that you didn&#39;t care so much after all about the person you lost. Similarly, people can feel a paradoxical sense of loss for the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/grace-in-grief/202303/can-you-be-happy-when-youre-decimated">grief</a> itself, as if the public longing for the lost one honored their connection to others too. Although grief is healthy and normal, it is important to remember that happiness is as well. We have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Wzs0r4M5RncC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA195&amp;dq=evolution+suffer+loss+of+loved+one&amp;ots=kukZp1zIMt&amp;sig=72pj2AkD2uxoP3TQHcjBL93mueI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false">evolved</a> to suffer when separated from our loved ones, but not to suffer forever. Allow yourself to recover.<br><br> S <span class="smallcaps">o far</span> , I have been writing about one&#39;s own experience of grief and how to manage it. But what about another person who has had a loss and is suffering? We may struggle to help others in this situation, because the tendency is to avoid bereaved people when we don&#39;t know what to say or we think they want to be left alone. And perhaps their suffering frightens us. Grieving people <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1525/si.2008.31.4.422?casa_token=ntrhsxb0l6AAAAAA%3ARypM6HpoEPZWYvIlMaUfpxw0hX6TvkSG4vk7u09r4wlN4JiX80YTxane1UuBYRsiDgLKWBB0vm4OTu0">can also pull away</a> from us in an effort not to burden us with their sadness.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/10/five-stages-complicated-grief-wrong/671710/">Read: There are no &#39;five stages&#39; of grief</a><br><br> Avoiding those who are grieving is a mistake.

Many experts <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://rightasrain.uwmedicine.org/life/relationships/how-to-support-someone-grieving">suggest</a> that the best approach doesn&#39;t rely much on <i>your</i> words at all; it&#39;s best to simply be present and listen.<br><br> Just listening can be the best analgesic you can offer for the pain of others. It can even heal.
