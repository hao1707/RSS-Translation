link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">散布</a>不安、不信任和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/11/elon-musk-twitter-problems-misinformation-bigotry/671952/">阴谋</a>的引擎。随着下一代社交媒体网站的出现，一个问题是：我们能做得更好吗？<br><br>我想是这样。用户可以自下而上地解决我们的问题，而不是坚持从华盛顿或硅谷寻求不太可能的自上而下的解决方案。作为个人，我们不一定能创造出更好的社交媒体平台，但我们可以在它们上做出更好的选择。因此，无论您是要加入 Threads 这样的新网站，还是想从 F​​acebook 这样的老网站中获得更多信息，这里都有一些关于如何在不使用社交媒体的情况下使用社交媒体的提示。<br><br><strong>举办一场街区派对。</strong><br><br>在现实生活中，如果有人闯入一群陌生人的聚会并开始大声辱骂并扰乱谈话，他们很快就会被赶出聚会。然而在社交媒体上，这种刻薄的​​行为不仅被容忍，有时甚至受到赞扬。在我们的日常生活中，对不当行为进行纪律处分是我们学习变得更好的方法。但由于这些规范在互联网上从未得到维护，许多空间变得有毒，许多人从未得到改掉坏习惯所需的反馈。阻止是反馈的一部分。当人们意识到如果以某种方式表达自己的意见就不会被听到时，他们就会停下来。即使他们不这样做，您也没有义务适应他们。您的社交媒体动态就是您的聚会，您可以决定宾客名单。这样做，你并不是脸皮薄，而是脸皮薄。您是一位尽职尽责、营造良好氛围的主人。<br><br><strong>正确地阅读房间。</strong><br><br> “阅读房间”的警告是社交媒体上最懒惰的反驳之一。对于那些理智上不严肃的人来说，这是一种通过示意想象中观众的反应来驳回争论而不涉及其实质内容的方式。但这个概念包含着真理的核心。在社交媒体上，我们都在不同的房间里工作，说话时会想到不同的人。许多在线冲突都是由交叉线造成的，当针对一种情况的对话（对志同道合的人来说是一个讽刺性的笑话）渗透到另一种情况（在不理解这个笑话的人之间）时。但这个问题有一个简单的解决办法：在发布内容之前，问问自己这是否是适合您要说的内容的平台。<br><br>有些声明是针对群聊的，而不是针对整个互联网的。其他人则受益于尽可能广泛的听证会。想要电视或旅游推荐吗？问问 Twitter 或 Facebook 的蜂巢思维。想分享您的风景假期吗？ Instagram 吧。想要讨论敏感的个人事务或解决棘手的政治问题吗？在聊天中与您的朋友联系，或者只是向值得信赖的知己发送私人消息。如果做得好，阅读房间不应该阻止你说出你想说的话，而是帮助你说出可以真正被听到的事情。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/social-media-algorithms-twitter-meta-rss-reader/673282/">Yair Rosenberg：如何重新控制您在互联网上阅读的内容</a><br><br><strong>不要使用社交媒体作为公众舆论的代理。</strong><br><br>正是因为不同的平台有不同的用处，所以吸引了不同类型的人群和话语。这意味着这些网站并不能很好地反映民众情绪。举个例子，皮尤研究中心<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/04/07/social-media-use-in-2021/">发现</a>，只有 23% 的美国成年人使用 Twitter（该网站现在被称为 X），而<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/2021/11/15/the-behaviors-and-attitudes-of-u-s-adults-on-twitter/">在这些人中</a>，“最活跃的 25% ……产生了所有推文的 97%”。换句话说，几乎所有美国推文都来自约 5% 的成年人。这没有什么问题。一般来说，每个社交媒体网站都服务于自己的利基市场和社区。当人们试图将这些平台当作他们不具有代表性的公众样本时，问题就出现了。这往往会导致对我们的世界做出<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/ron-desantis-twitter-campaign-launch-online/674191/">错误的</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/deep-shtetl/61e06b2c55e52500217add01/your-bubble-is-not-the-culture-lin-manuel-miranda-harry-potter/">结论</a>，因为这些网站从来就不是为了这个目的。<br><br> TikTok 和 Twitter 等网站往往会优先考虑最响亮、最有趣或最粗鲁的声音，而不一定是最明智或最友善的声音。此外，与大多数新技术一样，社交媒体平台的用户群<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/internet/fact-sheet/social-media/">偏向年轻人</a>，这意味着人们不太可能听到老年人的观点和经历。 （这就是为什么像乔·拜登这样的政治候选人往往在社交媒体上表现不佳，但在投票箱上表现更好的原因之一。）在采用新平台和使用旧平台时，我们应该牢记它们的局限性，而不是不加批判地允许流行的内容他们影响整个公司或国家的进程。<br><br><strong>抵制愤怒的诱饵。</strong><br><br> “推特的棘手之处在于：你看到人们对不公正现象有多么愤怒，你会说‘哦，这是一个很棒的地方’，但当你再滚动一点时，关于苹果酱的对话同样愤怒，你开始思考也许这毕竟不是那么好。”视频游戏主播斯蒂芬·弗拉瓦尔 (Stephen Flavall) 在 2020 年的 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/JoINrbs/status/1286131058266632192">观察</a>完美地捕捉到了社交媒体在愤怒和其他方面的运行方式，以至于似乎所有在线亚文化最终都会被最愤怒、最反对的版本所取代。这是有原因的：愤怒会传播。<br><br> 2021 年，剑桥大学和纽约大学的研究人员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2024292118">发现</a>，关于一个人的意识形态对手的推文比关于其政治盟友的推文更有可能被分享，也更有可能引起愤怒的反应。换句话说，事实证明，分歧比一致更能传播。与此同时，耶鲁大学的研究人员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.yale.edu/2021/08/13/likes-and-shares-teach-people-express-more-outrage-online">发现</a>，愤怒帖子的点赞和分享会鼓励那些发帖者在未来发表更多愤怒的帖子。总而言之，这些研究说明了社交媒体如何创建一个反馈循环，在这个循环中，平台本身鼓励用户逐渐发布更多关于敌人的精神错乱的言论。获得奖励的行为会被重复。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/03/negativity-bias-online-news-consumption/673499/">德里克·汤普森：如果你想悲伤，请点击这里</a><br><br>在针对愤怒而优化的空间中浸泡会对我们的公民话语和心理健康产生许多<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/05/social-media-democracy-trust-babel/629369/">负面影响</a>。如果一切都是令人愤慨的，那就没有什么是令人愤慨的，我们就失去了在真正必要时表达谴责的能力。职业巨魔为了个人利益而将他人的愤怒武器化，故意激起对其内容的愤怒反应，以提升自己的形象。 （其中一个甚至成为了总统。）但是有一个简单的方法可以摆脱这个陷阱：增强你喜欢的东西，忽略你不喜欢的东西。阻止不良行为者而不是与他们接触。这条规则可能有例外，但坚持将其作为默认规则将极大地改善您的在线体验，并阻止煽动性个人试图劫持我们的集体注意力。<br><br><strong>放下干草叉。</strong><br><br> 2020 年 6 月，彼得·温伯格 (Peter Weinberg) 登上 Twitter 热搜榜，多个平台上充斥着来自他从未见过的人的恶毒、斥责信息。这位49岁的人的家庭住址甚至被发布在网上。原因是：他在一段<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/nyccookies/status/1268640734254714883">病毒视频</a>中袭击了一名张贴支持乔治·弗洛伊德传单的女孩。但他不是。整个事件是业余网络侦探的身份错误所致。事发<em>第二天</em>，温伯格就在现场。他也不是这场驾车私刑正义的唯一受害者。正如<em>《纽约》</em>杂志<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/06/what-its-like-to-get-doxed-for-taking-a-bike-ride.html">报道的</a>那样，“另一名男子，前马里兰州警察，也受到了错误的指控。指责他的推文被转发并点赞超过 50 万次。”<br><br>愤怒的暴民可能是社交媒体病态最有害的表现。许多这样的进攻在目标选择上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://patch.com/illinois/chicago/trolls-wrongly-accused-retired-firefighter-capitol-riot-murder">都是</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://newsletters.theatlantic.com/deep-shtetl/62bdd8c968f61f0021d69afa/i-dont-trust-viral-video-clips-and-neither-should-you/">错误的</a>，而且几乎总是与进攻不成比例。因为你此刻无法知道自己加入的流露是合理的还是误导的，所以负责任的选择就是弃权。如果你不希望自己的存在因一段粗糙的部分视频剪辑或措辞不当的帖子而被颠覆，那么你就不应该帮助颠覆别人的存在。坦率地说，反复练习那些你从未见过的人的滑稽动作，如果没有社交媒体，你根本不知道他们的存在，这既不健康也不富有成效地利用我们在地球上有限的时间。<br><br><strong>选择你的车道。</strong><br><br>当似乎每个人都在谈论某件事时，很自然地感到有必要谈论那件事。通过这种方式，社交媒体促使我们扮演专家的角色，并对实时发生的事件进行评论。很多人忽视了这种冲动，只是不断地发布他们的孙子或狗的照片。但其他人却屈服了，这导致了各种各样的问题。这是因为没有人是所有事情的专家，而且我们都有很多可能导致尴尬的盲点——无论是我们不认识的人群还是我们没有研究过的知识话题。在现实生活中，我们通常不会遇到很多暴露这些盲点的情况，当我们遇到这种情况时，我们希望有朋友能够温和地纠正我们。像 Twitter 这样的平台就没那么宽容了——它更像是一串意识形态香蕉皮摆在数百万陌生人面前。每天，网站上的某些内容或其许多后继者都会诱使我们发表超出我们专业知识的评论。但我们不必这样做。<br><br>这种克制不仅能让你避免尴尬，还能防止你对最新的突发新闻反应过度，而且当你有重要的事情要说时，它还能帮助你发挥作用。你在网上公开武断地谈论的话题越多，你就越有可能犯错，让人们有理由对你所说的其他内容打折扣。这并不意味着您不应该在互联网上直言不讳！但你应该将自己限制在你最希望被听到或影响别人的实际专业领域。你最不想看到的就是你对文化战争问题的即兴看法会损害你对真正重要的事情的深刻见解。这也是为什么依赖公众信任来传达信息的记者和学者应该坚持自己的节奏，而不是发布超出其范围的主题。如有疑问，请回忆一世纪拉比的智慧，他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sefaria.org/Pirkei_Avot.1.17?lang=bi&amp;with=all&amp;lang2=en">说</a>：“我一生都是在圣贤中长大的，对于一个人来说，没有什么比沉默更好的了。”<br><br><strong>燃烧前请阅读。</strong><br><br>我们都做到了。我们被文章的标题、推文或屏幕截图激怒，分享了我们对某个故事的不满，但没有真正阅读相关文章，也没有弄清楚标题是否准确，或者摘录的引文的上下文是否改变了其含义。孤立地这样做似乎无害，但实际上，它并不是孤立地发生的。如今，许多社交媒体用户认为，对他们没有真正消费过的内容做出判断是完全合理的，而这种波将金式的武断的集体积累会污染公共话语。<br><br>你的一年级老师说得对：不要以封面来判断一本书，或者，在这种情况下，不要以推文或标题来判断一个故事。自信地评论你懒得读的材料不仅是智力上的不诚实，而且是一种不诚实的行为。它告诉你的追随者你对他们的重视不够，无法阅读你与他们分享的内容，这是对他们的不尊重。它将社交媒体变成了一场闹剧，人们为想象中的争论而争论，但实际上没有人提出过。没有人能赢得这些辩论，也没有人变得更明智。现在是集体承诺结束这种做法的时候了，并在必要时呼吁那些参与这种做法的人。<br><br>哦，如果你在评论这里写的内容之前就已经到了这里：恭喜你。您已经是解决方案的一部分。现在请随意告诉我为什么我完全错了。<br><br></div>

America?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>这位威斯康星州主席扭转了该党的命运。但他的制胜秘诀将在 2024 年面临严峻考验。 <br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>丹尼尔·斯坦勒/路透社/Redux</figcaption></figure>这位被誉为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/03/wisconsin-democrats-ben-wikler-00022556">全国最好的国家主席</a>”<span class="smallcaps">的人</span>并不是全国家喻户晓的人物。在他自己的州，他甚至不是家喻户晓的名字。但最近的一个下午，在威斯康星州格拉夫顿的一个小村庄，本·威克勒就像波诺一样。<br><br>两打中年和退休志愿者排队握住威斯康星州民主党主席的手。 “感谢你们所做的一切，”当威克勒在奥佐基县党总部绕了一圈时，他们微笑着对他说道。 “我们很高兴你在这里。”就像骄傲的孩子面对钦佩的父母一样，志愿者告诉他今年夏天他们筹集了多少钱以及敲开了多少扇门。<br><br> “这是康妮，”有人拍着一个女人的肩膀说道。 “她刚刚赢得了学校董事会的竞选。” “耶，学校董事会！”威克勒欢呼起来。<br><br>他在那里为一位威斯康星州议会候选人敲开最后一天的大门，这位候选人在纯红色的奥佐基县获胜的机会很小，奥佐基县是密尔沃基以北密歇根湖岸边的一个远郊地区。但重点不是赢，而是输得<i>少</i>。那天下午，威克勒成功地发表了一场演讲，其热情几乎与黑门阿拉贡一样鼓舞人心。他对志愿者们说：“这次选举向我们民主党人和整个国家表明，现在正在发生变化。”同时也提醒共和党人“民主党人没有放弃民主。”<br><br>自 2019 年担任主席以来，威克勒让他的政党在威斯康星州摆脱了事实上的无足轻重的局面。在唐纳德·特朗普 (Donald Trump) 拆除中西部北部所谓的蓝墙四年后，威克勒 (Wikler) 的领导力帮助威斯康星州以及整个总统选举在 2020 年向民主党倾斜。然后，今年早些时候，威克勒 (Wikler) 筹集的数百万美元帮助了民主党一位进步的候选人在非周期州最高法院竞选中获胜，这可能会导致威斯康星州<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vox.com/voting-rights/2023/8/3/23818858/wisconsin-gerrymander-clarke-wisconsin-election-commision-supreme-court-janet-protasiewicz">严重不公正划分的地图</a>重新设计。<br><br>威克勒的才华在于让人们展现出来。他通过将每一次竞选都视为一生中的一次选举来做到这一点。他告诉我：“资源往往会流向那些可以发挥作用或激发他们的想象力的地方。”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/10/wisconsin-democrats-worried-about-2020-election/616894/">阅读：威斯康星州的事情还没有结束</a><br><br><i>资源</i>是一种委婉的说法。他真正指的是<i>美元</i>。由于共和党几年前通过的立法，威斯康星州是少数几个个人可以<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pbswisconsin.org/news-item/who-were-the-50-largest-campaign-donors-to-wisconsin-political-parties-in-2022/">无限</a>量向政党捐款的州之一，而政党又可以无限量地向候选人转移资金。<b> </b>威克勒的天才之处在于他将筹款的武器转向了使其成为法律的政党。<br><br>在明年总统选举前夕，美国人的目光将再次集中在威克勒的家上。 “如果我们能在所有 50 个州都有本·威克勒 (Ben Wikler)，那么民主党的状况将会更好，”播客主播、前奥巴马演讲撰稿人乔恩·费儒 (Jon Favreau) 告诉我。但人们可能已经厌倦了事关生死存亡的选举，无论该党花多少钱说服他们出去投票。再次激发想象力，尤其是代表一位支持率不太高的年长现任议员，可能是威克勒迄今为止最艰巨的挑战。<br><br>我和 Wikler 的团队一起<span class="smallcaps">乘坐</span>他们租来的小型货车去参加奥佐基县的活动。当我滑开后门时，我发现党主席被扣在中间一排的座位上，他的头擦着天花板。 42 岁的 Wikler 留着山羊胡，身材高大（6 英尺 4 英寸），戴着透明框眼镜，穿着牛仔衬衫和牛仔裤。他看起来像布鲁克林的父亲，但威克勒是来自麦迪逊的父亲，他对此感到非常自豪。<br><br>我刚坐下来，威克勒就开始了一个 30 分钟的复习课程，为了我的利益，讲述威斯康星州独特的过去。罗伯特·拉福莱特和国家的社会主义根源。参议员乔·麦卡锡。汤米·汤普森州长的福利改革。接下来是最近的历史：2011 年斯科特·沃克 (Scott Walker) 就任州长，共和党成功推翻州议会两院。沃克第 10 号法案削弱了公共工会的权力。共和党<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/magazine/the-new-front-in-the-gerrymandering-wars-democracy-vs-math.html">颇具争议且秘密的选区重划计划</a>。<br><br> “你已经说过多少次这样的话了？”我问他什么时候完成。<br><br>他笑了。 “实际上还有一个扩展版本。”<br><br>如今，威克勒与妻子、三个孩子以及一只巨大而兴奋的伯尔尼山犬一起住在麦迪逊西区童年的家中。但在搬回中西部北部之前，威克勒是华盛顿特区进步组织 MoveOn 的主任，他领导了该组织的抗议活动，反对共和党试图推翻《平价医疗法案》。在此之前，威克勒在担任阿尔·弗兰肯的研究员和制片人一段时间后，主持了一个名为<i>“The Good Fight”</i>的政治播客。这位来自明尼苏达州的前参议员仍然是一位亲密的朋友。 “他非常聪明，非常有趣，而且是一位非常优秀的作家，”弗兰肯上个月在电话中告诉我威克勒。 “他拥有全套的条件，这很难成为州主席。” （弗兰肯说，弗兰肯 2003 年出版的书名《<i>谎言和告诉他们的说谎的骗子</i>》是威克勒的主意，弗兰肯说。）<br><br>然后，2016 年，特朗普冲破了蓝墙，自 1984 年罗纳德·里根以来首次为共和党赢得了威斯康星州的选举团票。这就是为什么威克勒最终决定搬回家乡，帮助重振共和党的命运。<br><br>作为主席，威克勒因在推特上发布有关威斯康星州选举的高潮帖子而闻名，这些帖子在网上疯传。他不断接受采访，传达竞选上下投票的紧迫性。威克勒告诉我，他担任主席期间的核心策略是“购买更大的警报器，并尽可能将其置于尽可能高的位置。”<br><br>美国大多数州政党大约有六名全职带薪工作人员，但威克勒将其工作人员从 30 人扩大到 70 人。<b> </b>他拥有全面的数字化运营、内部研究小组和全职青年组织者。<br><br>自 2019 年以来，威克勒利用他在国家政治中的关系筹集了超过 1.1 亿美元，这对于一个缔约国来说是一个惊人的高数额。他的团队最成功的筹款活动是让 Robin Wright 和 Julia Louis-Dreyfus 等名人关注獾州：2020 年 9 月，威斯康星州民主党举办了一场 Zoom 桌读会，宣读 1987 年的电影<i>《公主新娘》</i> ，这部影片将大部分成员重新聚集在一起。原来的演员阵容。该活动吸引了超过 10 万名观众并筹集了 425 万美元。于是他们又做了两次，分别是<i>《白宫风云》</i>和<i>《副总统》</i>的演员。<br><br>威斯康星州本可以走邻国爱荷华州的道路，后者在过去六年中急剧右转。在獾州，偏向民主党的趋势始于2018年，当时许多选民反抗特朗普。但在很大程度上要归功于威克勒建立的机器，该党在过去几个周期中继续在该州大都市区以越来越大的优势获胜，而在密尔沃基倾向共和党的郊区则以较小的优势输掉。 <i>《密尔沃基哨兵报》</i>退休华盛顿分社社长克雷格·吉尔伯特告诉我，尽管民主党在全国范围内一直在农村地区流失选民，但他们至少成功地止住了威斯康星州农村地区的选民流失。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/05/democrat-rob-sand-iowa-statewide-office/674109/">阅读：爱荷华州最危险的民主党人</a><br><br>事实证明，全州选举是民主党最有价值的战场。在威斯康星州，拜登在 2020 年以 2 万票击败特朗普，去年民主党州长托尼·埃弗斯以微弱优势赢得连任。唯一令人失望的是曼德拉·巴恩斯输给了现任共和党参议员罗恩·约翰逊。但就在去年春天，威斯康星州人选举珍妮特·普罗塔谢维奇进入州最高法院，这场竞选打破了投票率<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/voter-turnout-in-wisconsin-supreme-court-race-breaks-record/">记录</a>，并吸引了乔治·索罗斯、史蒂文·斯皮尔伯格和伊利诺伊州州长 JB·普利兹克的捐款。<br><br>威克勒作为民主党领导人的遗产将是该州捐助基础的国有化——他通过主张威斯康星州处于美国政治斗争的中心而实现了这一点。这是否有利于民主则是另一回事。<br><br>来自加利福尼亚州或伊利诺伊州的富有的民主党人进行了大量捐赠，但他们并不是普通威斯康星州人的理想替代者。 “选举不应该是少数右翼亿万富翁和少数左翼亿万富翁之间的拉锯战，”威斯康星州民主运动前执行董事马修·罗斯柴尔德告诉我。 “但是本没有进入竞争环境。威斯康星州的共和党人创造了竞争环境。美国最高法院创造了竞争环境。”<br><br><span class="smallcaps">如果威克勒的战略</span>是使威斯康星州的政治成为全国性的，那么他也致力于超本地化的竞选活动：威克勒认为，民主党应该在各地都有存在。这就是为什么这辆货车从格拉夫顿再向西行驶两个小时到达巴拉布，参加一年一度的农业设备博览会。<br><br>该缔约国的农村核心小组在农作物喷洒无人机展示区和研磨林产品示范区之间搭建了一个帐篷。威克勒向他的一些成员发表了鼓舞人心的讲话，然后大步走向索克县共和党人的帐篷。 “嗨，我是民主党主席，”他一边说，一边向三个在树荫下聊天的 60 多岁男人伸出了手。在几分钟的时间里，这四人有点尴尬地来回讨论前州长沃克的成功和失败，以及他们中是否有人对特朗普的第二次提名感到特别兴奋。 （他们没有。） 这一切都足够令人愉快。<br><br>然后，当威克勒转身离开时，其中一名男子把他拉到一边。 “我得告诉你一件事，”他低声说道。 “今天早上我在你的帐篷里和一位绅士谈过话，我从来没有遇到过比他更好的人，也没有进行过比他更合理的谈话。”威克勒笑容满面。 “作为党主席，听到这个消息我很高兴，”他回答道。<br><br>下午晚些时候，我们离开巴拉布，前往米德尔顿参加志愿者野餐，米德尔顿是门多塔湖沿岸绿树成荫的麦迪逊郊区。聚会是在一个郁郁葱葱的后院举行的，那里到处都是不守规矩的开花灌木和那种古怪的动物草坪装饰品，似乎在宣告，<i>一位民主党人住在这里！</i><br><br>院子里挤满了来自不同街区的上门小组的白发志愿者。 “我认为没有本我们什么也做不了，”活动主持人乔安娜·理查德告诉我。 “他的领导力至关重要：他的人脉关系，以及我们全年筹款和组织的方式。”几分钟后，威克勒发表了当天的第三次也是最后一次励志演讲，感谢人们在过去几年中所做的工作。他告诉他们，我们正在“建造比我们任何人都更大的东西”。 “你是这个项目的核心，是民主最关键的熔炉——关键引擎，网络的中心。”<br><br>共和党人正在为威斯康星州的反弹而努力。本月晚些时候，他们将在密尔沃基举办共和党总统初选的第一场辩论，共和党全国代表大会将于明年夏天在同一城市举行。这种全国性的关注对于该州来说是件好事，因为该党最近低估了民主党的支持率。<br><br> “他们非常擅长获得好莱坞的资金，”州共和党主席布赖恩·希明(Brian Schimming)在电话中告诉我，语气听起来既阴暗又嫉妒。他说，“很难与”民主党名人和富有的州外捐助者竞争。 “我需要将威斯康星州进一步国有化。”<br><br>这一次，共和党人肯定会更加关注筹款。 “如果本认为他或他的继任者总能赢得金钱竞赛，那他就是在自欺欺人，”罗斯柴尔德告诉我。但金钱并不是<i>这场</i>比赛最终最重要的因素。<br><br> “我宁愿遇到我的问题，也不愿遇到本的问题，因为本是一位非常不受欢迎的现任议员，”席明告诉我。 “我们的人们对这场比赛真的很兴奋。”<br><br>事实上，威克勒似乎确实有点紧张。他担心选举投票率低，而且人们没有足够认真地对待特朗普第二次担任总统的真正可能性。 “2020 年，人们准备不惜一切代价击败特朗普。我让人们提前退休并搬到威斯康星州做志愿者，”他在车上告诉我。 “现在这一切都没有发生。”<br><br> <a

Her]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>小说家苏珊·陶布斯（Susan Taubes）新出版的一本新书进一步揭示了她为使​​自己完整而付出的努力。 <br><figure><img

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/divorcing-susan-taubes/9781681374949?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>离婚</i></a>,<i> </i>她一生中唯一出版的一本小说。该评论几天前刚刚发布。评论家休·肯纳 (Hugh Kenner) 认为这部作品是一位“女小说家”的自命不凡的作品。肯纳犯了残酷且不可原谅的错误。 <i>《离婚》</i>是一部杰作，由 NYRB Classics 于 2020 年重新发行，这次获得了高度评价：诙谐、原始且令人发指。半个多世纪过去了，在一场女权主义革命之后，它仍然给人一种完全原创的感觉，并且仍然令人震惊。现在的读者可能会从评论或序言中了解到这本小说的大部分内容都是自传，这使得震惊更加严重。<br><br> <i>《离婚</i>》的主人公索菲·布林德或多或少被赋予了陶布斯的故事：在匈牙利的童年；在纳粹占领之前飞往美国；父亲是著名的精神科医生，独自抚养她长大；与她的第二故乡和她自己终生都有疏远感；对匿名性行为的吸引力。和苏珊一样，索菲也研究过“哲学、认识论、发表的论文”。还有索菲正在离婚的丈夫埃兹拉·布林德 (Ezra Blind)，他是一位才华横溢、迷人、风流的哲学教授，简直就是苏珊丈夫雅各布·陶布斯 (Jacob Taubes) 的翻版。<br><br>苏珊和苏菲之间最大的区别是苏菲已经死了。她的故事是由一位无名的叙述者讲述的，她在香榭丽舍大街上被一辆迎面而来的出租车斩首，她将这种死亡视为一种解放。 “我的身体变得巨大，它的数千万亿个细胞突然释放，扩散，加速，欢腾地冲向巴黎的七个大门，冲出克利希门，拉夏贝尔门，奥尔良门，凡尔赛门， ”索菲突然用第一人称说道。小说的其余部分在这个充满活力的超现实的未来和之前的生活之间交织。<br><br>苏菲死前一直在努力控制自己。她太默许了。可以说，她让埃兹拉借用了她。她扮演了他分配给她的角色，包括他喜欢上演的施虐受虐场景中的受虐狂，以及其他女人和她。 “她甚至无法适当地嫉妒或冒犯，”陶布斯写道。 “当她还是个小女孩的时候，她的父亲就向她解释过为什么男人需要猥亵才能获得快乐。”索菲和他们的三个孩子跟随以斯拉环游世界，从纽约到耶路撒冷，然后又回来，而他却未能完成这本可以确保他获得稳定学术任命的书。当他们打架时，索菲在心里记下了具有解离状态的慢动作之美的笔记：“索菲看着他的食指：它在画圈或搅拌一些神秘的啤酒。它以垂直的方式走向崇高。它呈环形俯冲到水平位置，指向她。食指开始越来越威胁地向她摇动，好像它不知道该怎么办，”陶布斯写道。 （据雅各布·陶布斯的熟人说，苏珊完美地捕捉到了他。）索菲离开并在巴黎建立了自己的公寓，但仍然无法摆脱生活与梦想之间“实际上没有太大区别”的感觉。<br><br>她的来世是奇异的、幻觉的。作品略显色情，但却被狂躁的活力所弥补。噩梦般的场景一闪而过，就像自我厌恶的闪光灯一样。索菲比以往任何时候都更加超然，她似乎在粉色缎子衬里的棺材上和高处观察着自己的婚礼。这是一件邪恶的事情，包括男客人的圆满仪式。后来，她观看了自己的欢乐葬礼：埃兹拉“带着节日的气氛接受哀悼；他神情焕发，在人群中跳着华尔兹，带着同情的浪潮。 He holds a large handkerchief over his mouth to cover a leer.” Her corpse looks good, its viewers say: “&#39;... done by big-name experts. Latest American techniques,&#39;” she hears Ezra&#39;s sister boasting. “&#39;The sunglass are <i>haute monde.&#39;</i> ”<br><br> B <span class="smallcaps">efore <i>Divorcing</i> , Taubes wrote</span> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/lament-for-julia-and-other-stories-susan-taubes/9781681376943?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Lament for Julia</i></a> , in the early 1960s. No one would publish <i>Lament</i> then, so NYRB Classics is bringing it out for the first time, accompanied by nine short stories, some of them published in magazines during Taubes&#39;s lifetime. <i>Lament</i> appears to be both a trial run for the later novel and completely unlike it, or much else. Its narrator isn&#39;t dead, but he isn&#39;t alive. He&#39;s a homesick angel, or demon, or imp—even he isn&#39;t sure what he is. Some unspecified force has “garrisoned” him, as he puts it, in the mind and body of a girl named Julia. She&#39;s a rebellious beauty being raised in an unnamed Central European town sometime in the early 20th century by parents so grotesque they might as well be monsters in a Brothers Grimm fairy tale.<br><br> The ghost (although Taubes doesn&#39;t specify what class of being he is, a working title of the novel was <i>The Ghost</i> ) represents himself as Julia&#39;s guardian angel, but his drooling effusions make him sound like a pedophile. He swoons over Julia and deplores her sexual development. Her surging breasts strike him as a “tumescence.” Her periods revolt him. Her vagina alarms him too: “Julia was a glove with the thumb turned in, a wrinkled purse. A mere repository, a trench, a sponge that absorbed everything; whatever she touched seemed to impregnate her.” To his horror she throws herself at local boys: “Put her in a convent! It seemed the perfect solution.” He squirms at being forced to be a “female impersonator,” though he knows he couldn&#39;t find a more luscious host. He&#39;s a parasite, he says, feeding on her “like a hermit feeding on grubs and roots.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/08/machine-susan-steinberg/592795/">Read: Girl, haunted</a><br><br> <i>Lament</i> starts slowly, which may be one reason Taubes couldn&#39;t find a publisher for it. We&#39;re dropped into the story in mid-lament: Julia has run away. A chapter goes by before she comes into focus. The narrator calls her a “storybook princess with golden tresses” as well as a “witch child,” but her real charm lies in her power of refusal. She struggles bitterly against the maid who tries to force a starched petticoat and pink taffeta dress over her head. Or is it the ghost inhabiting her who does the fighting? He takes responsibility: “I think that is when I threw my first fit. Several windowpanes were broken, a flowerpot smashed, a bottle of ink poured over Julia&#39;s dress. They thought she had a devil.”<br><br> She does have a devil, of course, or so says the devil. After a while, though, we start to wonder. He&#39;s curiously nebulous. Julia never seems to address him directly. Everything he claims they do together she could just as easily be doing alone: reading, making up plays, pouring ink over a dress. He calls himself her mentor, but she ignores him. They squabble; she&#39;s “sublimely vague.” “I can&#39;t even be sure whether Julia willfully scorned me when, in fact, she simply acted as if I wasn&#39;t there,” he says. “Judging from her behavior at the time one would believe she thought herself the only person in the world.”<br><br> Does the ghost exist or just think he does? And what would it mean for a ghost to be mistaken about his existence—as opposed to a person like, say, Descartes? This is the kind of metaphysical problem Taubes liked to build her stories around. She had the wherewithal. She did her graduate work in religion and philosophy at Radcliffe and published articles on the influence of Jewish gnosticism on Heidegger and Simone Weil, among other topics. Gnosticism is a nihilistic heresy, an inside-out and upside-down theology, according to which  God is an absence rather than a presence, creation the interment rather than embodiment of the divine spark, and man a creature divorced from himself. In all the varieties of gnosticism, Taubes wrote in a 1954 essay on Heidegger, “one motif prevails: man is not &#39;at home&#39; in the cosmos.” She goes on to describe a “gnostic self” who sounds a lot like <i>Lament</i> ’s plaintive incubus: a “stranger in the world” thrown into it willy-nilly from somewhere beyond.<br><br> I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m making <i>Lament</i> sound like a dry, ontological parable. It is a parable, and it has an existential dimension, but it&#39;s anything but dry. What makes it powerful—what makes Taubes&#39;s whole body of work powerful—isn&#39;t the ideas, though you can lose yourself in them, but the affect. <i>Lament</i> ’s gnosticism channels radical discomfort. The ghost&#39;s clammy unease with the flesh-and-blood Julia has the feel of body dysmorphia. He could be the split-off version of a hypercritical self she won&#39;t acknowledge. Julia can defy sexual norms with abandon as long as the spirit takes upon himself the recrimination that might otherwise follow; once she grows up and begins to drift away from him, life goes less well for her.<br><br> Fear and abhorrence of female sexuality pervade other stories in the collection too. “The Gold Chain” is a monstrous folk tale about a simpleminded but dissatisfied wife who finds her pleasure in a field with a lover whose face she never sees: “If I look it&#39;s sin,” she thinks, “but if I keep my eyes shut it&#39;s like it happened in my sleep.” Needless to say, when the men of the village learn of the woman who has sex with strangers with her eyes closed, they rejoice, and not because they have her happiness in mind.<br><br> In another even more chilling story, “Dr. Rombach&#39;s Daughter,” a psychoanalyst projects onto his teenage daughter uncontrollable sexual desires, both for him (she has a “strong oedipal attachment,” he tells her) and for young men she has yet to meet. He dwells on these supposed feelings while he fondles her: “&#39;What were you thinking right now?&#39;” he asks, then answers his own question. Marianna must be tired of him, he says. She&#39;s longing for a young man to walk in. “Of course, you&#39;re a growing girl, your glands are beginning to work, your breasts are developing—&#39; he studied her breasts, &#39;they could be a little, well, shapelier. Don&#39;t you wear a brassiere?&#39;”<br><br> Dr. Rombach leaves Marianna numb, empty, and silenced. She&#39;s a bookish girl, and when Dr. Rombach interrupts her, she has been sitting with a notebook in her lap and a pencil in the air. After he leaves, Marianna can&#39;t remember what she&#39;d been about to write: “The page of the notebook before her was blank. She was trying to think of something to write in it. A beautiful phrase. She looked around the room but she did not see anything that wanted to be put into words … <i>Blank</i> was the only thing she could think of.”<br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">ne hopes that this story</span> is purely fictional, though some portion of it seems likely to be true. To go by <i>Divorcing</i> , generally considered a reliable source on Susan&#39;s life, her father did tell her from a very young age that she couldn&#39;t help being in love with him, did talk to her about sex in very graphic terms, was emotionally invasive. Her depiction of their intense relationship, especially in the wake of his divorce from her mother, is frankly creepy. Whatever Taubes&#39;s father was like, though—and there is no evidence that he molested her—she was not silenced. She became an important intellectual, though it has taken five decades for the world to appreciate that. In the past few years, her philosophy has enjoyed as much of a revival as her fiction; several scholarly papers on her essays have recently appeared, and a book called<b> </b><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-philosophical-pathos-of-susan-taubes-between-nihilism-and-hope-elliot-r-wolfson/9781503633186?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Philosophical Pathos of Susan Taubes:</i><b><i> </i></b><i>Between Nihilism and Hope</i></a> ,<i> </i>by Elliot R. Wolfson, an eminent scholar in Jewish mysticism, came out<b> </b>this year.<br><br> Taubes would be particularly gratified that her genius is finally being acknowledged because when she was alive, it was her aching beauty that garnered attention, at a moment when intellect and beauty were seen as incompatible. She had the pale skin, elfin eyes, and raven locks of a “Belle Dame sans Merci.” Taubes knew that most men couldn&#39;t hear, didn&#39;t <i>want</i> to hear, what went on behind that mask, no matter how brilliant she was. Nor did many women; extreme beauty does strange things to people. “I don&#39;t know anybody who isn&#39;t in love with me,” she wrote her husband, apparently not exaggerating. As a result, she added, “I don&#39;t have a single friend, only scenes + complications.” (This was not quite true; right at that moment she was getting to know her fellow Harvard graduate student Susan Sontag, who would be Taubes&#39;s best friend for the rest of her life.) Even Taubes didn&#39;t take herself as seriously as she should have, working harder to drum up jobs for her difficult husband than to advance her own career.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/10/misunderstanding-susan-sontag/596653/">Read: Misunderstanding Susan Sontag</a><br><br> When Taubes became a novelist—she was divorced by then—she began to wrestle with the throttled female voice. She called it “the problem of first-person narrative by women” in a journal entry in 1965, not long after she&#39;d finished <i>Lament.</i> As late as the 1960s—who remembers this anymore?—stories written by women in the first person were still uncommon. Women weren&#39;t publishing much fiction in <i>any</i> voice, compared with men—hence Kenner&#39;s sneering epithet, “lady novelist.” Taubes must have worried that the  female <i>I</i> would be perceived as impertinent or absurd, and she wasn&#39;t wrong to think so, as Kenner&#39;s review also confirms. <i>Lament</i> sidestepped the female-first-person problem by making the ghost the narrator. But he&#39;s a wraith at best, not even sure he&#39;s real, and he, too, feels self-conscious about saying “I.” It seems uncouth, embarrassing. “My predicament dates from the moment I began thinking in the first person; seriously, that is,” he says. “Let us assume that it is I who speak, I proposed to myself, let us drag the hidden author on the stage, uncombed, in his nightclothes, and turn the spotlight on him as he blinks and stammers.”<br><br> Taubes never took full possession of the first person. She got close, though. <i>Divorcing</i> employs a mode of address known as “free indirect,” in which the narrator&#39;s voice floats in closer or less close proximity to the characters&#39;. <i>Divorcing</i> ’s narrator is lodged deep in Sophie&#39;s head, and on rare occasions simply is her. Maybe Taubes would have used <i>I</i> more consistently if she&#39;d lived. Or maybe her great subject was always going to be the non-integratable self. There was more to Susan Taubes than could be contained in a pronoun. As <i>Lament</i> ’s ghost says of his and Julia&#39;s strained cohabitation, “If she were simply a body and I simply a mind. If only it were as simple as that. But we are a jumble of odd bits and between us we do not even make a person.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 11 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/susan-taubes-lament-for-julia-book-review/674984/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/susan-taubes-lament-for-julia-book-review/674984/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Before a Bot Steals Your Job, It Will Steal Your Name]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> The future of AI looks a lot like Tessa, Ernie, and Amy. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/wqXIb6ZAQ3BVqb5DvvU2IeKT3uo=/0x0:960x540/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/tessa_/original.gif" alt="A pixelated blue name tag that reads &quot;Tessa&quot; in white letters, on a black background" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> In May, Tessa went rogue. The National Eating Disorder Association&#39;s chatbot had recently replaced a phone hotline and the handful of staffers who ran it. But although it was designed to deliver a set of approved responses to people who might be at risk of an eating disorder, Tessa instead recommended that they lose weight. “Every single thing that Tessa suggested were things that led to the development of my eating disorder,” one woman who reviewed the chatbot <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/Cs1jp1pPkOs/?img_index=9">wrote on Instagram</a> . Tessa was quickly canned. “It was not our intention to suggest that Tessa could provide the same type of human connection that the Helpline offered,” the nonprofit&#39;s CEO, Liz Thompson, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/06/08/1180838096/an-eating-disorders-chatbot-offered-dieting-advice-raising-fears-about-ai-in-hea">told</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2023/06/08/1180838096/an-eating-disorders-chatbot-offered-dieting-advice-raising-fears-about-ai-in-hea">NPR</a> . Perhaps the organization didn&#39;t want to suggest a human connection, but why else give the bot that name?<br><br> The new generation of chatbots can not only converse in unnervingly humanlike ways; in many cases, they have human names too. In addition to Tessa, there are bots named Ernie (from the Chinese company Baidu), Claude (a ChatGPT rival from the AI start-up Anthropic), and Jasper (a popular AI writing assistant for brands). Many of the most advanced chatbots— ChatGPT, Bard, HuggingChat—stick to clunky or abstract identities, but there are now many new additions to the already endless customer-service bots with real names ( <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Lemonade_Inc/status/1380218164936577033">Maya</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.futuretravelexperience.com/2023/02/capital-a-launches-new-ai-powered-ask-bo-chatbot-for-transparent-enhanced-customer-experience/">Bo</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.dominos.com/chat-pizza-order/">Dom</a> ).<br><br> As generative AI continues to advance, expect a deluge of new human-named bots in the coming years, Suresh Venkatasubramanian, a computer-science professor at Brown University, told me. The names are yet another way to make bots seem more believable and real. “There&#39;s a difference between what you expect from a &#39;help assistant&#39; versus a bot named Tessa,” Katy Steinmetz, the creative and project director of the naming agency Catchword, told me. These names can have a malicious effect, but in other instances, they are simply annoying or mundane—a marketing ploy for companies to try to influence how you think about their products. The future of AI may or may not involve a bot taking your job, but it will very likely involve one taking your name.<br><br> The very first chatbot, ELIZA, wasn&#39;t capable of much. A therapist bot created by the MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum in the mid-1960s, ELIZA was more parrot than psychoanalyst, often doing little more than repeating and rephrasing questions that users asked it. Still, people ascribed this janky form of AI with more understanding, creativity, and personality than Weizenbaum had expected. A decade after ELIZA&#39;s debut, Weizenbaum <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://blogs.evergreen.edu/cpat/files/2013/05/Computer-Power-and-Human-Reason.pdf">remarked</a> that he was “startled to see how quickly and how very deeply people conversing with [ELIZA] became emotionally involved with the computer and how unequivocally they anthropomorphized it.” Today, the projection of human traits onto computers has a name: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/06/google-lamda-chatbot-sentient-ai/661322/">the ELIZA effect</a> .<br><br> The following decades brought chatbots with names such as Parry, Jabberwacky, Dr. Sbaitso, and ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity); in 2017, Saudi Arabia granted citizenship to a humanoid robot named Sophia. But that was before AI was convincing enough to feel <em>real</em> . In this new era of generative AI, human names are just one more layer of faux humanity on products already loaded with anthropomorphic features.<br><br> Although Microsoft&#39;s official name for its chatbot is simply Bing Chat, the AI initially appeared to have an alter ego that called itself Sydney. It was suppressed after professing its love for a journalist, but maybe not permanently. “If you want it to be Sydney,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theverge.com/23733388/microsoft-kevin-scott-open-ai-chat-gpt-bing-github-word-excel-outlook-copilots-sydney">Microsoft&#39;s chief technology officer said of Bing Chat in May</a> , “you should be able to tell it to be Sydney.” ChatGPT, meanwhile, sends out responses word by word, as if it&#39;s thinking. A rectangle blinks as it types, not unlike when a friend is typing over iMessage. “These are design choices, very thoughtfully done, to create that verisimilitude,” Venkatasubramanian said. “These bots are designed to create an impression of sentience, which, as humans, we are particularly susceptible to.”<br><br> Names are an easy way to make products feel smarter and more personal. That seems to be especially true of the customer-service bots that companies have been turning to for years, and especially post-ChatGPT. Every bank seems to have its own Erica (Bank of America), Sandi (Santander), or Amy (HSBC). People craving White Castle sliders can now place their order through the company&#39;s drive-through bot, Julia. The bot displays its name on the screen before taking orders—“I&#39;m Julia, a new voice assistant”—and shamelessly encourages customers to order extra food and drinks. Queries to Lufthansa can be directed toward its AI, Elisa—a human-seeming touch that would provide little comfort if the airline lost my luggage. But giving a bot a real name can translate to sales. Research from 2021 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstream/handle/11299/223127/Schanke_umn_0130E_22360.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y">found</a> that giving customer-service chatbots anthropomorphic features, including a human name, has “a direct, beneficial relationship with transaction outcomes.”<br><br> The proliferation of chatbots with human names follows the popularity of Amazon&#39;s Alexa, but the bots don&#39;t “wake up” when their name is called—an issue so present for people named Alexa that it helped inspire a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.iamalexa.org/">nonprofit organization</a> dedicated to renaming the device. Still, like Alexa, many of the customer-service bots are female-coded products whose sole purpose is to obey commands, though that is not universally true. A spokesperson for Anthropic said the company named its chatbot Claude because it “wanted a warm, friendly name for our model” and “noticed a convention of naming assistants with female names that we wanted to buck.”<br><br> With Alexa and other home assistants, “you can still physically see the product and know that at the end of the day, it is a technology gadget,” says Merve Hickok, the senior research director at the Center for AI and Digital Policy. “Chatbots are disembodied. Our interactions with chatbots are similar to how we communicate with other humans.” In the ChatGPT era, people might already assume that bots are sentient; addressing one by name doesn&#39;t help. The risk could be especially apparent for chatbots&#39; most vulnerable users, says Gavin Abercrombie, an AI expert at Heriot-Watt University, in Edinburgh—such as children and adults suffering from dementia. If voice assistants like Alexa could <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/29/business/amazon-alexa-penny-plug-intl-scli/index.html">encourage</a> a 10-year-old girl to touch a penny to a live electrical outlet, then a generative AI that can communicate more like a person, and is named like one too, seems destined to backfire. “Giving a device a human name is not necessarily the wrong choice, but it has to be really thought out,” Abercrombie told me. “What are we trying to do? What kind of relationship do we expect the users to have with this?”<br><br> White Castle&#39;s Julia, which simply facilitates the purchase of hamburgers and fries, is no one&#39;s idea of a sentient bot. But as we enter an era of ubiquitous customer-service chatbots that sell us burgers and plane tickets, such attempts at forced relatability will get old fast—manipulating us into feeling more comfortable and emotionally connected to an inanimate AI tool. Resisting the urge to give every bot a human identity is a small way to let a bot&#39;s function stand on its own and not load it with superfluous human connotations—especially in a field already inundated with ethical quandaries.<br><br> But for now, bots with human names are becoming unavoidable. My name has so far evaded Silicon Valley, but I doubt it&#39;ll long before I end up expressing my concerns to an AI-powered Jacob.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Fri, 11 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/chatbot-human-names-ai/674979/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/chatbot-human-names-ai/674979/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Edvard Munch Lightens Up]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> A new exhibition offers a counterpoint to <em>The Scream</em> . <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/qWTxBaor5RiSl-E5ZPd0uvD9yE4=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/2023/07/Munch_Opener/original.png" alt="painting by Edvard Munch of man in colorful field with scythe, with horizon of clouds and trees in background" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Munchmuseet</figcaption></figure> E <span class="smallcaps">dvard Munch</span> , 1863–1944, was a zeitgeist conductor. Like Dostoyevsky before him, like Kafka after him, he was one of those somewhat hastily assembled humans—the skull plates not stapled down, the nerve endings dangling—who get chosen by the daemon of history to bear its message into the world.<br><br> Poor bastard. “You paint like a pig, Edvard!” yelled a young realist named Gustav Wentzel, getting in Munch&#39;s face at an 1886 exhibition in Kristiania (now Oslo) that featured his painting <i>The Sick Child</i> . “Shame on you.” Munch, at the time, was penniless. His best friends were nihilists. Also alchemists, sadists, diabolists, absinthe fiends, and the occasional haunted dramatist. Ibsen came to his 1895 exhibition, the one that sparked a public debate about Munch&#39;s sanity, and growlingly counseled him: “It will be with you as it was with me. The more enemies you have, the more friends you will have.” Strindberg, very mad, was a fellow paranoiac: “As regards Munch, who is now my enemy,” he wrote to his editor, “I am certain he will not miss the opportunity to stab me with a poisoned knife.” Years later, when Munch was painting on the beach and a gust of wind upended his easel, he blamed Strindberg.<br><br> Alienation, God-death, the self as destabilized center of experience—this was the daemon&#39;s message. The full harrowing gospel of modernity. It lived inside Munch, forcing its way along his fibers and blazing out of his doomy Scandinavian eye sockets. It gave him breakdowns and a massive thirst for alcohol. It made him strangely attractive to women. It <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://unherd.com/2022/05/how-art-cured-edvard-munch/">hospitalized him</a> , several times. He starved, he raved, he was vilified, and—being a great artist—he understood exactly what was happening. “If only one could be the body through which today&#39;s thoughts and feelings flow,” he wrote to a friend. “To succumb as a person, yet survive as an individual entity, that is the ideal.”<br><br> Here the scream that passes through nature carries a note of ecstasy.<br><br> And what does one paint, after the person has succumbed? What does one seek to represent? Not the merely external, the inert and boring <i>there</i> . And not the fluttering optical field of the impressionists, whose advances he had absorbed while living in Paris. Munch wanted to go past the eyes, further into the head. He was after the deepest action of the outside upon the inside, the pressure of the universe upon the mind. This, for him, was realism. This is how you get to his smash hit, his psychic world-statement: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-scream-again-and-again"><i>The Scream</i></a> . The foregrounded figure on the walkway, the light-bulb-shaped head, the fishy hands, the bands of sound warping the evening sky, the powerless cartoon face stretched in terror—all that&#39;s left of the human is a kind of flipped switch, an opened channel to the vibration of reality. Which is overwhelming. “I heard a huge extraordinary scream pass through nature,” he wrote later.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/dostoyevsky-crime-punishment-birmingham-sinner-saint/620175/">From the November 2021 issue: Why did Dostoyevsky write <em>Crime and Punishment</em> ?</a><br><br> “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.clarkart.edu/exhibition/detail/edvard-munch-trembling-earth">Trembling Earth</a> ,” the glorious new exhibition of Munch&#39;s work at the Clark Art Institute, in Williamstown, Massachusetts, is not exactly a rebuttal to <i>The Scream</i> , but it so amplifies our understanding of the artist as to constitute, almost, a counternarrative. It&#39;s a revelation. Mystical experiences can be negative, as many of Munch&#39;s certainly were: They can show you how it feels to fall out of the hands of the Holy Spirit. But the deeper you go, the higher you fly, as the Beatles said. Here the scream that passes through nature carries a note of ecstasy.<br><br> The paintings at the Clark are presences—generous ones. They radiate, shedding a supernatural warmth. As you enter the gallery, you meet <i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-yellow-log/vgHlfH4mE6cT-A?hl=en">The Yellow Log</a></i> : felled tree trunks stacked in a snowy forest. The trunk at the top of the stack launches right out of the picture and off the wall, as laser-straight as the handrail in <i>The Scream</i> . But it glows gorgeously, this tree trunk; it shines at you like a cauterized sunbeam, its cut end a brilliant disc of white gold. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://artsandculture.google.com/asset/the-haymaker/HQFSu8d7gfSlbg?hl=en"><i>The Haymaker</i></a> , the landscape pours forward on a wheat-colored curve, a rush or spill of summery splendor that threatens to carry off the figure scything grass in the foreground—but the haymaker, via the flex of his braced legs and the torque in his body as he calmly swings the scythe, redirects the current, keeps it flowing: He&#39;s at home in this world. And those rows of smoldering blue-green cabbages in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thehistoryofart.org/edvard-munch/cabbage-field/"><i>Cabbage Field</i></a> —are they streaming toward the horizon, narrowing to an omega point/flash of nullity, or are they streaming out of it, as if to embrace us? (Embraced by cabbages: That&#39;s how this show will make you feel.)<br><br> Melancholic Munch, mad moody maimed-by-modernity Munch, is well represented in “Trembling Earth.” There are creepy scenes in glades, empty faces, heads in hands, bleak semi-allegorical figures gazing at the sea, apple trees boiling like toxic soup, and a black-and-white lithograph of <i>The Scream</i> itself. But these images are contrapuntal to the theme. One wall away from the <i>Scream</i> lithograph is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thehistoryofart.org/edvard-munch/sun/"><i>The Sun</i></a> , from 1910—a dazzlement of rays and light pellets flung off an ocean sunrise. Behind all of the brightness, you can even see the vague skull shape of the <i>Scream</i> head, as if the sun itself is a blast from its third eye.<br><br> Munch had his own sort of weirdo metaphysic, an intuitive and crank-scientific faith in the great self-renewing ferment of life, the mulching of souls, the crystals, etc., and as he got older he would explore the implications of this in images of near-Blakean luminosity. Male and female essences; volcanoes of yearning beings. “The earth loved the air,” reads one crayon-on-paper text from a 1930 album called <i>The Tree of Knowledge</i> .<br><br> Like all genuine craftsmen, Munch respected labor. Forestry. Harvesting. The working of the land. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://useum.org/artwork/Digging-Men-with-Horse-and-Cart-Edvard-Munch-1920"><i>Digging Men With Horse and Cart</i></a> , from 1920, the men are bent double over their shovels while the white horse standing between the shafts is an almost transparent wreath of energies and bunched muscles. The horse—for which Munch&#39;s horse Rousseau may have been the model—nods at the digging men, conferring a blessing.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/05/johannes-vermeer-exhibit-rijksmuseum-amsterdam/673495/">From the May 2023 issue: Vermeer&#39;s revelations</a><br><br> About his own work Munch was wonderfully un-precious: Although he loved his paintings and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/edvard-munch-beyond-the-scream-111810150">referred to them</a> as his “children,” he would heap them carelessly, trip over them, drip on them, absent-mindedly bash them around, or leave them outside to take their chances in the elements. (He was semiserious about this: The process of weathering his paintings, exposing them, he called the <i>hestekur</i> —the horse cure.) A visitor to a later Munchian studio, inquiring why a certain canvas had a large hole in the bottom corner, was startled to hear that one of Munch&#39;s dogs had run right through it.<br><br> “His paintings, landscapes as well as representations of human beings are suffused by deep passion.” That&#39;s Goebbels. Hitler was less of a fan, and in 1937 dozens of Munch&#39;s paintings were caught up in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/this-massive-edvard-munch-painting-was-hidden-in-a-barn-from-the-nazisnow-its-up-for-auction-180981479/">Nazi sweep</a> of “degenerate art.” Munch&#39;s last years were spent under German occupation, at his country seat in Ekely, Norway. On the day of his death, age 80, he was reading, for the umpteenth time, his copy of Dostoyevsky&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-possessed-the-devils-fyodor-dostoyevsky/9781731701374?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Devils</i></a> .<br><br> <i>The Scream</i> will live forever. It&#39;s a cave painting on the inner wall of the human skull. And Munch himself heard the scream, no doubt about that: It ran through his being. But there&#39;s a paradox. To produce an image like that, an image of such cosmic vulnerability, you need great strength. You can&#39;t collapse, or not totally. You need to be extra durable. You need to be able to handle it. And Munch, for all his infirmities, could handle it. He had a secret health, a secret hardiness, and the show at the Clark puts us in touch with its source.<br><br> <small><i>This article appears in the</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09"><i>September 2023</i></a> <i>print edition with the headline “A Sunnier Edvard Munch.” When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/04/mohammed-bin-salman-saudi-arabia-palace-interview/622822/">摘自2022年4月号：绝对权力</a><br><br>一项好的协议是使以色列和海湾国家之间本已升温的关系正式化，同时允许美国——在过去三十年里在该地区花费了不可估量的鲜血和财富——减少在中东的时间和金钱。<br><br>因此，以色列和沙特阿拉伯之间的联姻并不是一场胜利。以色列和埃及之间的和平协议提供了一个警示性的例子。当时，该协议受到欢迎，因为两国在三十年里打了四场灾难性的战争，而该协议在美国对埃及的军事援助的支持下，使这个阿拉伯语世界上人口最多的国家脱离了苏联的轨道。但今天的埃及人民很大程度上憎恨以色列。两国之间几乎没有有意义的社会或经济联系，而目前陷入混乱的政治和金融问题的埃及对以色列持怀疑态度，而不是将其视为合作伙伴。<br><br>以色列和约旦之间的和平也类似。这两种关系取决于美元、安曼和开罗的独裁政权以及受影响国家军事和安全部门之间的合作。两项和平协议都在参与者中培养了一种权利意识：埃及、以色列和约旦政府都认为自己每年欠数十亿美元的军事援助，并对任何可能减少此类援助的建议表示愤怒。埃及的问题尤其严重，该国军队是该国最强大的政治角色，但依赖援助来提供就业机会和保护其经济利益。<br><br>继 2020 年《亚伯拉罕协议》之后，以色列和阿拉伯联合酋长国之间迅速发展的关系，在某种程度上感觉与埃及和约旦的关系有所不同。以色列和阿联酋领导人对中东其他地区的看法彼此相似（而且应该说，通常与华盛顿的看法不同）。例如，穆罕默德·本·扎耶德和他的儿子和兄弟对伊朗和逊尼派伊斯兰主义者构成的威胁与任何以色列人一样感到震惊，而阿联酋雄心勃勃的主权财富基金与以色列初创生态系统之间的协同效应也充满希望。以色列人有理由访问阿布扎比和迪拜，阿联酋人有理由访问海法、耶路撒冷和特拉维夫。每个国家都可以为对方做出贡献——阿联酋的资本、以色列的创新。<br><br>以色列和沙特阿拉伯也应该如此。总体而言，海湾地区是目前世界上为数不多的经济亮点之一。海湾地区的主权财富基金拥有来自石油和天然气收入的大量现金，在国内外大手笔支出，而西方私募股权和风险投资公司则寻求在该地区筹集资金。<br><br>沙特阿拉伯拥有所有富裕的海湾国家中最大的消费者基础，这就是为什么零售商和消费品制造商在那里花费的时间比卡塔尔或阿联酋等国家更多的原因。王储穆罕默德·本·萨勒曼的经济改革使在沙特阿拉伯做生意比过去几年更具吸引力，并且更多的西方公司——当然是在利雅得的压力下——将其区域业务的基础设在沙特阿拉伯，而不是在沙特阿拉伯。阿联酋。<br><br>以色列人可能希望在沙特阿拉伯投资，而沙特人几乎肯定会想在以色列投资。这种对两国关系正常化的激励应该足够了，美国不应该觉得有义务提供更多。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/06/israeli-saudi-relations/395015/">阅读：以色列和沙特阿拉伯——终于在一起了？</a><br><br>尽管如此，有传言称美国计划增加对沙特和以色列安全的承诺，这一前景令我感到担忧。以色列与其邻国之间的和平应该允许美国在该地区部署<em>更少的</em>资源，而不是更多。但美国外交官常常低估他们代表五角大楼做出的承诺。<br><br> 2015 年的伊朗协议就是一个有用的例子。由于一些非常充分的理由，五角大楼被排除在美国和伊朗之间的谈判之外，而较为乐观的政府成员希望这可能会导致美国对该地区政策的新时代。但该协议本身实际上锁定了美国在附近的强大军事态势，以强制伊朗遵守协议：协议签署后，将美军从海湾转移到东亚变得更加困难，而不是更容易。<br><br>我担心，对沙特阿拉伯或以色列做出的任何正式安全承诺都可能会在未来几十年内向中东派遣数万名美军。在冲突中将美军调入海湾比您想象的要困难，因此为了应对突发事件，您需要的大部分物资必须提前部署到该地区。 （在奥巴马政府执政结束时，约有 35,000 名美军半永久驻扎在海湾地区。）美国不应以优先考虑太平洋战区为代价，对中东（昨天的战争现场）做出新的安全承诺。<br><br>不过，我理解耶路撒冷和华盛顿的热情。尽管我担心美国可能会为了完成协议而做出不明智且最终不必要的承诺，但拜登政府——是的，还有之前的特朗普政府——值得高度赞扬。感谢您让我们如此接近对以色列、沙特阿拉伯和美国外交来说将是一项重大成就。<br><br></div>

data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www2.hawaii.edu/~dennisk/texts/introwindgourd.html">传说</a>中，葫芦里蕴含着夏威夷所有的风——只有知道对每个人唱什么歌的人才能召唤出这些风。葫芦本身以夏威夷仁慈的风之女神 La&#39;a Maomao 命名。<br><br>本周早些时候，当我观察到异常猛烈的风吹过考艾岛的棕榈树时，我发现自己想起了葫芦，比我记忆中在夏威夷见过的还要强烈，然后几个小时后，当紧急警报响起时，我又想起了葫芦。出，提醒我注意同样的风在东部约 190 英里的毛伊岛引发的可怕火灾。当疏散令下达时，毛伊岛历史悠久的拉海纳小镇已无希望免遭毁灭。目前官方称至少有 36 人死亡。整个事情发生得快得令人难以理解——快得人们从火焰中跳入大海试图自救。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/07/climate-change-tipping-points/674778/">阅读：气候崩溃可能会很快发生</a><br><br>当我住在欧胡岛时，在钻石头山脚下的一间小平房里，靠近冲浪胜地 Tonggs，距离如此之近，我可以听到海浪透过卧室的窗户传来，我经常在太平洋海啸预警中心网站打开的情况下入睡。我的手机，像枕头下的护身符一样闪闪发光。我喜欢在昏昏欲睡之前看到网站顶部的绿色横幅<span class="smallcaps">——没有海啸警报、咨询、监视或威胁</span>。但我从未想过要担心岛上发生野火。<br><br> “幸运的是，我们住在夏威夷”是这里的一句俗语，这句话看似甜蜜，但实际上是一种深切的感激之情的表达：对夏威夷人民的善良、对丰富的土地、对美好生活的品质的欣赏。光线，以及这个地方的整体柔和感——铁木的画笔针，挂满成熟芒果的树，冬天的夜空看起来更加紫色。<br><br>和其他地方一样，这里也发生了可怕的事情，而不仅仅是本周火灾的恐怖。当人们称其为“天堂”时，当地人有时会感到愤怒，这是有充分理由的。不止一次，来自东海岸的记者同事得知我是檀香山的记者后，会说<i>“哇，你报道什么？”</i>之类的话。<i>草裙舞和迈泰酒？</i>这样的评论让我意识到那些自以为好奇的人是多么无知。他们本可以发现但从未费心去学习的东西，这让我很生气。<br><br>夏威夷是一个极其复杂的地方，任何热爱夏威夷的人都会告诉你。也许这就是为什么拉海纳突然被烧成平地如此令人惊讶，即使它不应该如此。<br><br>通常，夏威夷让人感觉关系密切，就像每个人都认识每个人一样。发生任何大事之后，感觉就更小了。昨天，我花了大部分时间与岛上的朋友以及夏威夷的各种侨民聊天和发短信，而毛伊岛和大岛仍然在燃烧。一位朋友告诉我，他的一位朋友连夜飞往毛伊岛灭火。另一个人的小儿子和他的祖父母在毛伊岛，每个人都很好，但他们已经 24 小时没有电力或可靠的通讯。另一位朋友，她在拉海纳度过了整个童年，后来搬到了毛伊岛内陆地区，她发短信确认她的<i>家人</i>一切都好，一切都已确定。贯穿所有这些信息的明确主题——除了一遍又一遍地在两个方向上<i>说“谢天谢地，你没事</i>”——是一种明显的措手不及的感觉。我和几个在这里出生和长大的朋友交谈过，没有人记得这样的火灾，甚至没有人记得发生过这样的火灾。夏末的灌木丛火灾时有发生，但总是很容易得到控制。像我一样，没有人记得曾经担心过火灾。<br><br>在夏威夷，孩子们被教导要尊重自然——火山的古老愤怒、海洋的巨大力量和无限回报。每年夏天，飓风都会像发条一样在太平洋上翻滚，但由于物理和偶然的宇宙恩典，它们很少袭击。 （1992 年以 4 级风暴摧毁考艾岛的伊尼基飓风和 1982 年以 1 级风暴袭击考艾岛的飓风伊瓦是证明了这一规则的可怕例外。）一周前，当我看到飓风时多拉仍在积蓄力量，正像一场怪物风暴一样穿过群岛以南数百英里，我默默祈祷道谢，然后很快就忘记了这件事。夏威夷是晴朗的。但就像其他地方一样，它一直是透明的，直到突然之间就变得不透明了。这是夏威夷人们不断互相问的问题：飓风从什么时候开始引发野火？<br><br> <a

<i>“我们已经这样生活了很多年</i>，”加州人抱怨道。<i>我们告诉过你它也会为你而来。</i>当然，他们是对的。我希望他们没有。<br><br>我们生活在一个充满太多情感、太多表演性反应、太多确定性和太多悲观主义的时代。所有这些互相喊叫的结果是淹没了真正值得关注和关心的事情，更不用说它如何损害了我们团结起来解决生存问题的能力。而且——这是人类韧性和适应性的副产品，这些品质本来对我们很有帮助——有时从理智上理解一种现象是不够的；这与当火焰舔舐自家门时所得到的视角不同。<br><br>群岛上的人们内心深处都知道夏威夷与美国其他地区不同。你可以欺骗自己，认为这会以某种方式保护它免受在该国或世界其他地方遭受苦难的侮辱。 （顺便说一句， <i>La&#39;a Maomao 的</i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wehewehe.org/">字面意思</a>是“神圣的距离” <i>。</i> ）有时这种魔力确实有效。然而，这一次却没有。在不久的将来，某个时候太快了，另一个地方将再次发自内心地感受到我们多年来已经在智力上吸收的知识——我们已经没有时间来保护自己了，当美丽的东西燃烧时，你永远无法真正把它拿回来。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 10 Aug 2023 17:33:46 GMT</pubDate><guid

<em>《追逐自由》</em>跟随安娜·福斯特（曼迪·摩尔饰）前往欧洲旅行，在那里她摆脱了父亲的控制，投入了一名卧底特勤局特工的怀抱。同年九月上映的<em>《长女》</em>跟随萨姆·麦肯齐（凯蒂·赫尔姆斯饰）到加利福尼亚大学读第一个学期，在那里她也摆脱了父亲的控制，投入了一名卧底特勤局特工的怀抱。<br><br> 20 世纪 90 年代末和 2000 年代初是这类泡沫浪漫喜剧的繁荣时期，背景设定在现实世界的政治背景下，没有太多现实世界的政治。在<em>《追逐自由》</em> 、 <em>《第一女儿</em>》和 1998 年制作的经典电视剧<em>《我与总统女儿的约会》</em>中，总统的要求主要是作为父亲们对十几岁的女儿加强保护的理由。在有关海外皇室的电影中，例如<em>《公主日记》</em>和<em>《王子与我》</em> ，揭露一个角色是君主制的一部分主要集中在人际影响上。这些电影对政治的乐观态度是其吸引力的一部分。他们感觉自己就像<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://collider.com/disney-channel-original-movies-golden-era/">迪士尼频道电影宇宙</a>中的可互换参与者，在这个宇宙中，如果存在政治问题，可以通过某个任性的青少年向他们勤奋的单亲父母敞开心扉来解决——事实证明，他恰好是美国总统。美国。<br><br> <em>《红、白与宝蓝》</em>是一部在 Prime Video 上播放的新电影，其灵感来自于过去充满政治色彩的浪漫喜剧时代，但也有一些值得注意的曲折。 The film&#39;s protagonist is the first son of the United States—a biracial, bisexual law student named Alexander Claremont-Diaz (Taylor Zakhar Perez), who falls hard for Prince Henry Fox-Mountchristen-Windsor of Wales (Nicholas Galitzine) after the two are forced to fake a friendship to preserve diplomatic relations between the United States and the United Kingdom.作为一部奇怪的情侣浪漫喜剧，它是认真且易于观看的模因素材，即兴发挥了经典的敌人到恋人的比喻。与它的一些前辈不同的是，它试图将其爱情故事有意义地置于当代政治的高风险舞台上。但它的欢快幻想——年轻人的滑稽动作在成人的负责任治理背景下上演——感觉越来越虚假，而且在当前地缘政治动荡的时刻，落地有些令人不安。<br><br>

href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/red-white-royal-blue-book-summer-beach-read-11565285001">的病毒式传播机器 BookTok</a>上赢得了粉丝。不难看出这本书赢得读者的原因：麦克奎斯顿在 2016 年总统选举期间开始写这本小说，当时女性领导国家的想法似乎触手可及。在唐纳德·特朗普当选的震惊之后，麦克奎斯顿的书——以另一条时间线为背景，2016 年一名女性确实<em>获胜</em>——成为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/unthinking-pleasure-on-casey-mcquistons-red-white-royal-blue/">读者逃避现实的刺激</a>，尤其是那些像作者一样的酷儿读者。在<em>红、白、宝蓝</em>的颠倒世界里，同性性行为大量存在，恐同症受到广泛谴责。亚历克斯不仅仅是一个普通的孩子，他的妈妈支持他作为一个年轻的酷儿；他是德克萨斯州一位民主党人的儿子，她公开拥抱她的孩子，帮助她将家乡变成蓝色，从而赢得连任。<br><br><a

“在美国，如果你是一个姓氏中带有 Z 的移民，那么没有多少位高权重的人看起来像你或听起来像你，”一天早上亚历克斯在床上告诉亨利。 “我有机会成为我父亲在成长过程中看不到的人。”乌玛·瑟曼 (Uma Thurman) 饰演艾伦·克莱蒙特 (Ellen Claremont) 总统，她是 2016 年许多美国人投票支持的精益领导力的明显替身：她是一位多才多艺、自信的职业女性，27 岁时首次当选政治职务，并在连任竞选期间从她多元化的员工那里得到了线索。我们被引导相信，选举地图具有竞争性，但这并不公平。来自德克萨斯州的白人女性不仅可以赢得两次总统选举，而且还可以与她的墨西哥裔美国丈夫和他们的混血儿孩子一起赢得总统选举。<br><br>尽管如此，在后特朗普时代、后 1 月 6 日世界中<em>，《红、白和宝蓝》</em>还是忍不住要直面这种叙事方式的局限性。这部电影进入了一种政治氛围，两党执政不再是稳定的选举制度，国家政客公开主张对竞争对手使用暴力。麦克奎斯顿的书将克莱蒙特总统的对手描绘成极右翼共和党人，而这部电影则将他描绘成一位中间派保守派、一位不威严的密歇根州州长，其主要竞选纲领是为中西部带来更多就业机会。现代共和党政客的名册要可怕得多：在特朗普<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/">不断受到起诉的</a>背景下，共和党在德克萨斯州等州推动<a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/giselleruhiyyih/status/1607096923441217536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1607096923441217536%7Ctwgr%5E370af970e88acb999604b55921d0274bffb127ec%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Ftv-movies%2Fthe-invitation-on-netflix-compared-to-harry-meghan-fan-fiction-vampires-2019163%2F">粉丝小说</a>不断疯狂，人们很难不对亨利表面上顿悟的时刻翻白眼。 “皇室的观念在 21 世纪已经过时了，”他有一次说道。 “有时我想知道我们所做的事情是否对人们的生活产生任何有意义的影响。”这并不完全是一个标题中带有“温莎”字样的人的真诚反思，温莎是一个真实的王室，具有丰富的现实世界背景，而当这部电影对一个机构提出如此温和的批评时，它就处于最软弱的状态。尽管如此，似乎还是希望观众能够尊重并为之着迷。<br><br>这部电影真正成功的地方在于捕捉到了年轻人迷恋的独特老套动力，扎克哈·佩雷斯和加利津为他们的角色带来了一种为粉丝打造的温暖，加深了电影对他们关系有时摇摇欲坠的描写。大多数情况下，不情愿的年轻情人即使是白痴，对彼此或对周围的世界也是迷人的：他们在手机中输入“HRH [殿下]迪克黑德王子💩”之类的联系人姓名，进行交易分享对个人意义重大的珠宝首饰，并睁大眼睛、敞开心扉，互相讲述童年的快乐。这些场景总体上令人愉快， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2022/film/news/nicholas-galitzine-anne-hathaway-the-idea-of-you-1235375884/">特别是在加利津的例子中</a>，它们为我们至少对另一部<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://screenrant.com/booktok-sensaions-currently-adapted-to-screen/">即将出版的 BookTok 改编作品</a>的预期提供了谨慎乐观的看法。 （他将与安妮·海瑟薇一起主演<em>《The Idea of​​ You</em> 》，该片改编自罗宾·李 2017 年的小说<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vogue.com/article/idea-of-you-book">，灵感来自哈利·斯泰尔斯</a>。）<br><br>当演员体现出他的角色中比较轻松的怪癖时，他会表现出一些青春期的活力，这使得那些千禧年时代的政治浪漫喜剧看起来很有趣。那些早期电影中的年轻人的恶作剧不再与政府里有能力、头脑冷静的成年人的行为形成鲜明对比，这不是他的错<em>，也不是《红、白、宝蓝》</em>的错。这是一个不同的世界，一些古老的故事已经不再流传。<br><br></div>

Whether he would recognize the virtue in our modern settings is hard to guess—who knows what he would say about the fear of being canceled on social media? But the question at hand is not the source of fear but whether courage—to act in the face of fear rather than give in to it—invites happiness. And the research suggests that it does: Scholars have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259778922_Biological_contributions_to_well-being_The_relationships_amongst_temperament_character_strengths_and_resilience">shown</a> that courage can lead to resilience after adversity, and resilience <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-07991-007">leads</a> to greater happiness.<br><br> <b>2.</b><b> </b><b>Temperance</b><br> By this, the philosopher means self-control in the face of one&#39;s appetites and base impulses. He would classify the hippie motto “If it feels good, do it!” as a recipe for misery. Modern researchers investigating self-control agree, but with a twist. Scholars writing in the <i>Journal of Personality</i> in 2017 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/jopy.12322?casa_token=xFX0iDLDuiQAAAAA%3AfPL8aHFxVyoSerYzXI9M4aTRzOK-q_SMOPXPgMgGf9gzupRILN3uZvR-ZMakYB2hPOk1F9PnepszUL0">found</a> that as impulse control among college students increased over the course of a day, positive affect initially <i>fell</i> . As self-control kept rising, however, negative feelings decreased; happiness rose to its highest levels when self-control was at its highest as well. In other words, a little moderation isn&#39;t so good for well-being, but immoderate moderation may be great.<br><br> <b>3.</b><b> </b><b>Liberality</b><br> By this, the philosopher is referring not to politics (liberal <i>ism</i> ) but to money. Specifically, he recommends avoiding stinginess but without being profligate. In fact, evidence suggests that being a cheapskate influences your well-being. For example, three economists in 2014 set up an ultimatum-bargaining game in which participants had to split a certain amount of money: One participant offered a certain split; the other could say yes or no, but <i>no</i> meant that neither side got anything, so the offer of a lousy split could be answered with spite. The authors <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0108218">found</a> that physical stress levels were higher for both parties when the bargaining involved offered a split lower than 40 percent.<br><br> <b>4.</b><b> </b><b>Magnificence</b><br> Related to liberality is what Aristotle <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.loebclassics.com/view/aristotle-nicomachean_ethics/1926/pb_LCL073.207.xml">calls</a> “magnificence,” according to which a person “will think how he can carry out his project most nobly and splendidly, rather than how much it will cost and how it can be done most cheaply.” He was not asserting here that the path to happiness is to buy an ostentatious yacht; rather, magnificence <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://philarchive.org/archive/ATHADO">means</a> giving to projects that benefit a large number of people. Today, we might call this “munificence”—to be as philanthropic as you reasonably can be. For this, the support is unambiguous: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.journalppw.com/index.php/jpsp/article/view/4535">Giving feels good</a> .<br><br> <b>5.</b><b> </b><b>Greatness of soul</b><br> A great-souled person, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/e/ergo/12405314.0002.002/--modern-greatness-of-soul-in-hume-and-smith?rgn=main;view=fulltext">according</a> to Aristotle, acts like his close predecessor in ancient Greek philosophy, Socrates, who was a “being indifferent to good and bad fortune.” This requires being high-minded—not that you can&#39;t tell the difference between pleasant and unpleasant things, but that you are occupied by what is deeper and more meaningful in life than transitory pleasures and passing irritations. Indeed, research comparing the pursuit of pleasure versus of meaning among adolescents <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Linting-Zhang/publication/364186853_Pursuing_Pleasure_or_Meaning_A_Cross-Lagged_Analysis_of_Happiness_Motives_and_Well-being_in_Adolescents/links/6353a4656e0d367d91b4a52e/Pursuing-Pleasure-or-Meaning-A-Cross-Lagged-Analysis-of-Happiness-Motives-and-Well-being-in-Adolescents.pdf?_sg%5B0%5D=started_experiment_milestone&amp;_sg%5B1%5D=started_experiment_milestone&amp;origin=journalDetail&amp;_rtd=e30%3D">shows</a> that the latter leads to greater happiness. In other words, get off social media and read, say, <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i> .<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/03/covid-vaccine-hesitancy-anti-vaxxer-history/673522/">Read: To understand anti-vaxxers, consider Aristotle</a><br><br> <b>6.</b><b> </b><b>Gentleness</b><br> The virtue of gentleness refers to a propensity toward kindness and an ability to control your temper. The idea is that to be self-possessed in this way brings happiness. If true, then gentleness&#39;s opposite, aggression, should lower well-being by making it harder to manage one&#39;s own emotions. Researchers have tested this idea by asking people to think of someone they despise, and then either to imagine violent, malicious actions toward the person or to focus on a neutral thought (specifically, what they planned to do the following Wednesday—presumably <i>not</i> beat up the person in question). They <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0886260518812796?journalCode=jiva">found</a> that the aggressive thinkers began to brood over their fantasy assault and experienced lower well-being than the temperate crew as a result.<br><br> <b>7.</b><b> </b><b>Truthfulness about yourself</b><br> Aristotle put a great premium on honesty. He counseled against “pretense in the form of exaggeration” and boastfulness, but also against self-deprecation. You might say he recommended that we seek something like secure humility, through which we recognize ourselves and can show others who we are without either puffery or self-denigration. This tracks with the general work on humility, which <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lisa-Ross-4/publication/357425333_Humility_Personality_and_Psychological_Functioning/links/6238bf09781d2e6df7ab6792/Humility-Personality-and-Psychological-Functioning.pdf">correlates</a> with lower levels of neuroticism and depression, as well as with a greater love of life. But it is also consistent with research <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760801999461">showing</a> that insecurity and excessive self-criticism are associated with anxiety and sadness.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2014/09/when-philosophy-becomes-therapy/380531/">Read: When philosophy becomes therapy</a><br><br> <b>8.</b><b> </b><b>公平</b><br>This is a word that gets a lot of attention in our modern debates. It commonly involves efforts to increase fairness and to redress past discrimination. And it is manifestly true that when people believe they are being treated unfairly, it <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0956797611417262">lowers their happiness</a> . But Aristotle meant something totally different. “The equitable man,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D5%3Achapter%3D10">wrote</a> the philosopher, “is one who by choice and habit … does not stand on his rights unduly, but is content to receive a smaller share although he has the law on his side.” He called this “a special kind of Justice.” For this proposition, I can find no specific empirical evidence. However, it is almost certainly related to the next virtue.<br><br> <b>9.</b><b> </b><b>饶恕</b><br>Aristotle. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0054%3Abook%3D6%3Achapter%3D11">wrote</a> about the virtue of consideration for others. To the contemporary ear, this sounds like politeness, or sensitivity to others&#39; feelings, but the philosopher was recommending something much trickier: forgiveness and forbearance toward others&#39; faults. The wisdom of this advice has a large modern literature to support it. Virtually every study of forgiveness <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://osf.io/8qzgw/">shows</a> that practicing it purposefully and letting go of grievances lowers depression and anxiety symptoms.<br><br> <b>10.</b><b> </b><b>Modesty</b><br> Modesty is often thought in the modern world to resemble humility. But Aristotle defined it as refraining from shameful (if tempting) behavior—and applied this even to private conduct. This conception of modesty makes it similar to temperance, except that instead of moderation in the face of base appetites, we should abstain completely from vices. He added a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0054:book=4:chapter=9&amp;highlight=modesty">caveat</a> , however: Modesty could be a virtue only if “a good man would be ashamed if he were to do so and so.” In other words, you have to believe a certain action is vicious in order to be virtuous in avoiding it. I personally have no moral qualms about liquor but don&#39;t drink myself, so by the Aristotelian standard, my teetotaling is not a virtue. Bearing this caveat in mind, this kind of modesty is indeed a happiness strategy: When people undertake what they consider <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.1251560?casa_token=RE8pgoNigLIAAAAA:TcdOOZGDpCbkQbmv_wZgSuAGB-YrCj_FrXPAg7kR4I0-p9wP-Bn3iBHGcMVa1TMHqJvHiauz-0vU">moral acts</a> , they gain in happiness and even more so in sense of purpose; when they commit immoral acts, they experience the opposite.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">ristotle proposed these</span> happiness virtues more than two millennia ago, but I believe they provide a handy checklist today for living well. Here&#39;s an abbreviated list you might just want to put up on your fridge, or tape to the bottom of your computer screen.<br><br> 1. Name your fears and face them.<br> 2. Know your appetites and control them.<br> 3. Be neither a cheapskate nor a spendthrift.<br> 4. Give as generously as you can.<br> 5. Focus more on the transcendent; disregard the trivial.<br> 6. True strength is a controlled temper.<br> 7. Never lie, especially to yourself.<br> 8. Stop struggling for your fair share.<br> 9. Forgive others, and forbear their weaknesses.<br> 10. Define your morality; live up to it, even in private.<br><br> None of these rules is easy to follow. It is harder still to make them into habits.

The young of some of those species have long been practicing. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/27/nyregion/lord-of-the-winter.html">Great horned owls</a> find their voice while they are still doubled over in the dark of their moon-shaped egg. Having punctured the small air cell inside the egg&#39;s membrane with their budding beak, the proto-owlets inflate their lungs and start chittering. To each its private void, in a confinement growing tighter the bigger they get. If a spectral sound is supposed to come from beyond the grave, what word might characterize the babble of embryonic life, the noises of beings too tenuous to out themselves from their shell?<br><br> Owls&#39; otherworldly aura—their keening more an atmosphere than an animal sound—has engendered human superstition: What better shorthand for sinister happenings than their ethereal calls? And yet owls have inspired an altogether different response as well. In antiquity, they were sometimes identified as “human-headed birds.” Their domed head, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/how-owls-twist-heads-almost-360-degrees">wide-set eye sockets</a> (enabling binocular vision), and flat facial profile—distinctive within their biological class—are features that map onto a human visage. Whether the mythic depiction of owls as thoughtful, even philosophical, beings stemmed from this semblance alone, who can say?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/03/what-the-crow-knows/580726/">From the March 2019 issue: A journey into the animal mind</a><br><br> Perhaps the inference arose instead from an understanding of owls as active at the close of the customary workday, after nightfall, hours that offer the chance for repose and contemplation. Or perhaps owls&#39; sensitivity to stimuli beyond human ken suggested unfathomed know-how, a shrewd intelligence needed to navigate the dark. Either way, the sagacity of owls has long stood as a categorical anomaly in a world in which to be called “birdbrained” remains an insult.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Whether feared or revered</span> , owls have lately invited scrutiny by science writers and ornithologists eager to explain the birds&#39; acute perceptiveness, their far-flung environments (Antarctica is the only continent where you won&#39;t find owls), and the relationships between the two. In her 2016 best seller, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-hidden-lives-of-owls-the-science-and-spirit-of-nature-s-most-elusive-birds-leigh-calvez/9781632170255?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Hidden Lives of Owls: The Science and Spirit of Nature&#39;s Most Elusive Birds</i></a> , Leigh Calvez focuses on the owls of the Pacific Northwest, sharing her suspenseful nighttime explorations of the biology and behavior of birds ranging in size from the saw-whet owl, which can fit in a teacup, to the imposing great grey owl (known to some as the “Phantom of the North”). The conservationist Jonathan C. Slaght has devoted decades to learning about Blakiston&#39;s fish owl, “a fire hydrant with a six-foot wingspan,” as he puts it. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/owls-of-the-eastern-ice-a-quest-to-find-and-save-the-world-s-largest-owl-jonathan-c-slaght/9781250798718?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Owls of the Eastern Ice: A Quest to Find and Save the World&#39;s Largest Owl</i></a> (2020), Slaght yokes science to macho adventure in order to track the “floppy goblin” with electric-yellow eyes into the ice-strewn Primorye region of eastern Russia—a shrinking habitat, as are the owl&#39;s hunting grounds in the waters and riverbanks of some of the coldest tributaries in Japan.<br><br> Two new entries in the owl quest find closer kinship between bird and human, yet remain wary of domesticating the dark&#39;s inhabitants too much. In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-wise-hours-a-journey-into-the-wild-and-secret-world-of-owls-miriam-darlington/9781953534835?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Wise Hours: A Journey Into the Wild and Secret World of Owls</i></a> , the poet and nature writer Miriam Darlington warns against the urge to “cutify” the birds, noting how readily owls&#39; big, forward-facing eyes convey babyish appeal, not just profundity. She has in mind the owl of meme culture, featured in viral YouTube, Tumblr, and TikTok posts; remixed as fan art on Reddit forums; and available as an avatar option in multiplayer video games. Online, owls star as twee, humanoid knockoffs, and could hardly be further from their cryptic counterparts heard caterwauling in the starlit woods. A tour of the platforms reveals owls peevishly rain-drenched, owls clowning around, powder-puff nestlings pleading for a dangled snack, owls wincing and head-bobbing, owls as the rambunctious companions of domestic pets. The antithesis of otherworldly, these and similarly whimsical, infantilized animal portrayals are, in Darlington&#39;s view, an invitation to rob nature of its vital wildness.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/01/what-the-octopus-knows/508745/">From the January/February 2017 issue: What the octopus knows</a><br><br> Yet her project to preserve owl awe doesn&#39;t stop her from recruiting the birds to therapeutic ends. Darlington&#39;s adult son falls ill, and the narrative of his diagnosis and treatment (a “perma-drone of worries”) fastens itself to her journey into the insomniac sphere of owls in a season of family crisis. Midway between divesting owls of adorability and asserting their status as a marvel of nature, Darlington finds they have a role to play as her own personal gargoyles: They serve as forbidding beings that externalize the author&#39;s anxieties, helping her to either wing those fears away or confront them.<br><br> The deftness of owls&#39; senses might be regarded as “its own breed of genius.”<br><br> Jennifer Ackerman, internationally beloved by birders as the author of two popular books about avian intelligence— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-bird-way-a-new-look-at-how-birds-talk-work-play-parent-and-think-jennifer-ackerman/9780735223035?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Bird Way: A New Look at How Birds Talk, Work, Play, Parent, and Think</i></a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-genius-of-birds-jennifer-ackerman/9780399563126?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Genius of Birds</i></a> —supplies a more hardheaded assessment of owls, as well as of owl worship, in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/what-an-owl-knows-the-new-science-of-the-world-s-most-enigmatic-birds-jennifer-ackerman/9780593298886?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>What an Owl Knows: The New Science of the World&#39;s Most Enigmatic Birds</i></a> . She locates her owls in the vacant lots of suburban Maringá, in southern Brazil; aloft in hawthorn and chokecherry forests in western Montana; in rehab for roadside injuries in Minnesota; in a limestone quarry in Maastricht, a municipality of the Netherlands. Her investigations lead her to question: How smart are owls, really, and why have they come to stand for the supernatural solemnity of a world beyond us?<br><br> As Ackerman has previously relayed, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bird-brains-are-far-more-humanlike-than-once-thought/">startling findings have emerged</a> from the study of ornithological cognition over the past two decades. Researchers have discovered that, despite the lack of a layered cerebral cortex, the brains of several avian lineages permit complex feats of memory, logic, recognition, even math. Populations of corvids (crows, rooks, ravens, kindred others) are today famed for tool use, problem-solving, and seemingly ritual responses to their dead. American crows will congregate in cawing mobs around the lifeless bodies of birds of their same species, and later avoid food found in the area. Pinyon jays can remember each of a thousand spots where they once stashed a seed. European magpies pass the mirror test: They can recognize themselves as individuals. Some parrots&#39; language facility far exceeds mimicry. When trained in a lab, pigeons—surely the birds most impugned as automatons—turn out to be <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/23/science/pigeons-can-learn-higher-math-as-well-as-monkeys-study-suggests.html">on par with primates</a> in their counting ability (able to order arrays of objects, from a single object, to a pair, to a trio).<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Ackerman wants to know</span> what the latest science says about how owl species stack up against the cleverest birds. In relation to their body size, owls have large brains, an anatomical characteristic thought to have evolved in tandem with “parental provisioning” of offspring. Indeed, owl nestlings hatch before they can hunt or scavenge, dependent on food supplied by adults to provide the energy their brain tissue needs to grow. Yet for the most part, the brainpower of owls is enchained to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/07/light-noise-pollution-animal-sensory-impact/638446/">the activity of their senses</a> , rather than to the sort of intelligence found in birds that display inventiveness, selfhood, superior powers of recall, or numeracy. Some 75 percent of an owl&#39;s cortexlike forebrain is dedicated to hearing and vision, faculties so astounding in range and exactitude that they might seem, to us, a variety of natural magic.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2022/07/light-noise-pollution-animal-sensory-impact/638446/">From the July/August 2022 issue: How light and noise pollution confound animals&#39; senses</a><br><br> Owl species deemed “eared” or “horned” don&#39;t actually have external ear pinna the way we do, or bony horns like antelope. The flareable tufts of feathers, called “plumicorns,” they sport atop their head might be used to gesture to other owls, or perhaps to help conceal an owl by breaking up its rounded outline, making it appear more like the stump of a rough or broken branch. Though their true ears are mere apertures hidden under their feathers, owls&#39; reactivity to sound has few equivalents in the animal kingdom. The great grey owl can not only pick up the swish of a vole&#39;s footfall coming from a passage cored into a snowbank, but also figure out the elevation of the sound source, so as to strike through the snow and hit that very point. In some owl species, a portion of the hearing nerve branches into the optical lobe of the brain, which scientists speculate could mean that these owls form a visual signal of something heard but out of sight.<br><br> Owls see well in the dimmest conditions, and some species have retained photoreceptor rods that also make them sensitive to ultraviolet light—they are able to see colors that we cannot. Eurasian eagle owls exploit this part of their visual spectrum by having patches of neck plumage that are brightened by reflecting UV light, markings germane to displays of rivalry. Their young also have UV-reflective blotches inside their throat, prominent cues when the eagle owlets gape for food.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">For Ackerman,</span> the deftness of owls&#39; senses might be regarded as “its own breed of genius”—a supremely adaptive gift—though she recognizes that scientists rarely conceive of animal intelligence this way, finding evidence instead in exceptional behavior that conveys some kind of mental nimbleness or surplus. And owls do engage in some types of activity coded as “smart”: Ackerman reports on this repertoire too. Owls are curious about novelty in their environment—one reason they are prone to getting trapped in pipes, hay blowers, and ventilation shafts, which they gamely explore. Little owls can tell groups of people apart, tolerating farmers but fleeing at a glimpse of ornithologists, who catch and band them.<br><br> Though owl faces may seem static, some species flex and refashion the feathered discs around their eyes to reflect states of alertness or relaxation. Owls, especially juvenile ones, play. They also learn: Great horned owls spend about six months with their parents developing dexterities that will aid their survival, including how to fly through tightly set tree canopies, and how to pounce and kill. Compared with adults, young barn owls <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/sciencemain/stuff-dreams-owlets-sleep-human-babies-6c10945743">experience long spells of REM sleep</a> , the part of the sleep cycle associated with vivid and emotion-laden dreams in humans. If barn owlets dream, researchers suspect that those dreams help cement skills they acquire in the twilight, just as, when mice fall into REM sleep, the rodents enter a period of mental processing associated with learning to take cover from birds of prey (among them, owls).<br><br> Indeed, if we get beyond the emblematic wisdom of owls, we might come to recognize their most anthropomorphic quality—their versatility. Owls have unintentionally migrated as stowaways on ships and flourished in new territory. Corridors of agricultural land have facilitated their dispersal too. A few species have acclimatized remarkably well to our architecture and infrastructure, thriving in stables and belfries, occupying dugouts by causeways, roosting by the hundreds in city squares or in cemeteries (where grave sites, laid with edible votives, attract rodents).<br><br> Male burrowing owls have been documented festooning their earthen tunnels with decorative bits of potato, nubs of concrete, corncobs, old gloves, and stolen fabric (red, white, blue, green, in order of preference)—small treasuries underground. Camera traps have also revealed owl food sources to be more diverse than was once thought. They don&#39;t just eat mice, fish, amphibians, and insects, but will also scavenge for carrion, picking meat from dead dolphins and decomposing crocodiles on the shoreline, and stripping quills from the carcasses of crested porcupines to get at the flesh. The largest owl species will hunt other birds (including owls), and go after skunks, fawns, even cats.<br><br> Ultimately, Ackerman concludes that owls do not warrant their storied eminence as recondite knowledge keepers. Nor are they crow-witted by the standards of modern science. Owls are opportunists. When <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/02/flaco-owl-new-york-instinct-learning-hunting/673217/">Flaco, an eagle owl</a> , first escaped from the Central Park Zoo in New York, his flight muscles were not yet strong enough to support flying farther than four blocks, and he bumbled his landings. For a decade he&#39;d lived off hand-cut meat and slaughtered mice.<br><br> Today Flaco hunts his own vermin, and ranges artfully in the north end of Central Park. Bird-watchers praise the preservation of the wildness within him, despite his long captivity. What proves most bewitching about Flaco, described in his zoo days as “pudgy” and “grumpy,” is how swiftly he has freed himself not only from his enclosure but from performative charm. Owls might yet be our alter egos in more than their ability to prosper in a diversity of habitats. What animal more readily accommodates our deep need to swivel between symbolisms, now hooting their summons to our dark and powerful instincts, now strutting and fluffing their appeal to our sense of whimsy?

Instead, we stand side by side in the kitchen while I follow her muscle memory, rolling Russian tea cakes in powdered sugar and pressing the bottoms of forks into the dough balls for chocolate crinkle cookies. But my mom is Type A to a <em>t</em> : She&#39;s scanned the pages of step-by-step instructions and keeps them organized on her Google Drive, just in case. And she&#39;s already made sure that, when she dies—whenever that awful day might come—the folder containing all of these recipes will get sent directly to me.<br><br> Technically, the cookie recipes will be part of a larger posthumous digital delivery, arriving in my inbox courtesy of Google&#39;s Inactive Account Manager. They will reach me three months after my mom&#39;s departure—a time frame she selected after doing a regular review of her privacy settings earlier this year (like I said, Type A). With the cookie recipes will come the rest of her Google Drive, containing information including a list of account passwords, and all of her emails. This means there will be a December day when, instead of standing in the kitchen with my mom, I&#39;ll be standing with her digital ghost. I&#39;ll have mourned her physical passing, but will still be able to summon a part of her via my phone, propped up against the flour with one of many smudged and annotated recipe scans on display.<br><br> On this day, I expect I will grieve again. As the author Marisa Renee Lee <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/us-covid-grief-one-million-deaths/629533/">noted</a> in this magazine last year, “Grief is the repeated experience of learning to live after loss.” Today, with our ever-expanding digital and technological reach, loved ones left behind must encounter more reminders of that loss than ever before. Memory endures through the email accounts still collecting marketing messages, the Facebook arguments frozen in time, the iPad that continues to uselessly ping about an overdue library book. Left unattended, these digital assets float aimlessly in the internet&#39;s ether. To have control over them presents the inheritor with a challenging personal quandary: Do they take advantage of the weird comfort these digital remains can provide, sinking into an in-between world where the person who died still feels alive, in small pixelated ways? Or do they shut it all down and accept a second death?<br><br> Estate lawyers have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/05/the-social-media-will-an-expert-guide-to-your-digital-afterlife/257112/">long encouraged</a> clients to account for their digital property, but no one has come up with an emotional road map for the burden of inheriting these things. Some logistical matters will only reveal themselves when it&#39;s too late, forcing widows like Ashley Reese to take their grief to the Apple store.<br><br> “I had a weird breakdown,” Reese told me. Her husband, Robert Stengel, died from peritoneal mesothelioma in December at the age of 34. He left behind a comprehensive list of accounts and passwords, and among the things Reese inherited were his AirPods. It was seven months before she felt ready to resurrect his Apple Watch, which she brought to the Apple store for troubleshooting. An employee told her she was wearing it wrong. “I couldn&#39;t do it,” she recalled. “I&#39;m just like, &#39;I&#39;m sorry, this is not mine; it&#39;s my dead husband&#39;s.&#39;”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2022/10/five-stages-complicated-grief-wrong/671710/">Read: There are no “five stages” of grief</a><br><br> More so than ever before, it is possible for someone to live on through these digital shadows. In addition to holding on to his AirPods and Apple Watch, Reese still keeps her iMessage conversation with Stengel pinned to the top of the Messages app—she once accidentally sent him a text, and tried to unsend it when she realized. When she wants to watch something on Hulu, she can still select his profile. When she opens up YouTube, the algorithm still recommends <em>Succession</em> recaps or fight-scene compilation videos, the things Stengel would be watching if he were alive. When she&#39;s really missing him, she&#39;ll open up his camera roll, and look at one of the last pictures he took—a photo of Reese in his hospital room, unaware that she was being snapped. “This is just psychic damage every day,” she said.<br><br> Lingering in someone&#39;s posthumous digital presence can be as painful as it is comforting, and comes with unexpected revelations. “You don&#39;t want to read too much,” Marie, a woman whose mother died from ovarian cancer last fall, told me. (Marie asked to withhold her last name in order to speak about her family.) Her mom was proactive about her end-of-life plans, going so far as to order her own headstone before she died. She left Marie with her phone, and a list of passwords for all of her accounts. Looking through the device in the days after her mother&#39;s death, Marie found a text thread where her mom had been venting to a friend about a fight they&#39;d had. Marie discovered a Twitter account that her mom had apparently used to spar with right-wingers online—Marie had always thought her mother was as conservative as these opponents. Her Spotify was also revealing: “She listened to so much Taylor Swift, and I had no idea she liked Taylor Swift.”<br><br> Family and friends, themselves grieving, will send text messages to Marie&#39;s mother&#39;s phone. They say they miss her, hoping the sentiment somehow reaches her in the great beyond. Marie reads them. “It&#39;s a nice reminder that she was important to people,” she told me. To know her mother lives on in the thoughts and memories of others is a comfort, one she can now easily access through a screen. Technology like this, which can document a previously intangible part of a person&#39;s legacy, is a gift. It&#39;s also extremely fragile.<br><br> Websites shut down, accounts get hacked, devices break. It&#39;s not safe to assume that direct-message conversations and other social-media memories will be there forever. “My current plan is to just try to do as many digital copies of things as possible,” Reese told me. She has 10 years&#39; worth of messages with Stengel, and plans to back them up on her computer, in Google Drive, and to her iCloud. “I would be absolutely devastated if I lost that stuff.”<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/how-to-talk-about-grief-support/673232/">Read: What losing two children taught me about grief</a><br><br> At the same time, these digital spaces can help combat another inevitability: that, as the months go by, Reese will start to forget. “I have this compulsion now where if I have any thought about Rob or any memory, I&#39;ll immediately open my Notes app and write it down,” she said, “to remind myself of who I was and who he was, and make sure all those [memories] are intact.”<br><br> It&#39;s tempting not to think about death, choosing instead to be walloped by grief&#39;s right hook one day out of nowhere. Even when my mom let me know about the plans for her Google account, fearing I&#39;d receive an email notification and panic, she didn&#39;t use the word <em>dead</em> . We both knew what she meant, though, and now that I know what awaits me, the records of our digital interactions have more meaning. The Wordle scores texted back and forth, the DMs about our favorite Instagram-famous dog, even the hokey e-cards we still send each other on holidays—these things no longer feel like just more clutter in a digital abyss. Someday, they&#39;ll be the only thing that&#39;s left.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 10 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/grief-digital-assets-posthumous-technology/674964/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/08/grief-digital-assets-posthumous-technology/674964/</item></channel></rss>
