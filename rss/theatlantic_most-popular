referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>法新社/盖蒂</figcaption></figure>上个月底，尼日尔武装部队推翻了政府，逮捕了当选总统，并为自己夺取了权力。不久之后，一小群支持首都尼亚美政变的尼日尔人聚集在一起，表达对军政府的支持，其中一些人挥舞着俄罗斯国旗。他们普遍谴责西方，特别是前殖民国家法国。 “普京万岁！” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/07/30/niger-pro-russian-protesters-military-coup-mohamed-bazoum/">他们高呼</a>。 “打倒法国！”<br><br>这场政变在西方各国首都引起了相当大的恐慌，这是有充分理由的。自 2020 年以来， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cfr.org/in-brief/niger-coup-could-threaten-entire-sahel">萨赫勒地区不断发生政变</a>，这是一条横跨非洲、紧邻撒哈拉沙漠、具有重要战略意义的炎热半干旱地带。 2020年，马里政府垮台。 2021年，苏丹、乍得和几内亚也发生了同样的事情。去年，布基纳法索发生政变。尼日尔被视为萨赫勒地区抵御混乱和不稳定的最后堡垒，也是最后一个政权。美国在尼日尔设有无人机基地，法国也在那里驻军，这是抵御西非圣战主义高涨的重要防线。现在，所有这一切都面临着风险。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/niger-europe-migrants-jihad-africa/553019/">阅读：西非危险的移民镇压</a><br><br>很少有美国人习惯于过多思考尼日尔（“你指的是尼日利亚吗？”），但今年夏天的事件似乎提供了一个鲜明的结论：亲俄罗斯的士兵推翻了亲西方的政府。民主被军事独裁连根拔起。对于任何经历过冷战的人来说，这个故事都很熟悉。尼日尔出口铀——核反应堆的重要资源——这一事实使得尼日尔的斗争更容易被理解为一场地缘政治棋局。尼日尔是一颗棋子，当地缘政治国王之间拉动棋子时，就会发生政变。因此，这场政变很快就成为一个关于美国、俄罗斯和法国的故事，而不是关于尼日尔的故事。<br><br>在解释国际新闻中的重大事件时，尤其是那些发生在陌生地点的事件时，我们都倾向于表现出地缘政治偏见，这种心态通过国际大战略的棱镜过滤每一个事件，并让每一个故事都与<em>我们</em>有关。简单化、熟悉的叙述击败了细致入微的解释，这些解释涉及很少非专业人士听说过的政治人物，他们以晦涩的缩写词和难以发音的名字而闻名。<br><br>尼日尔的军事政变已经成为耸人听闻的头条新闻和与宏大地缘政治比喻相关的政治声明的素材。乌克兰总统的一名高级顾问<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/8/1/russia-responsible-for-niger-coup-says-top-ukrainian-official">在没有证据的情况下坚称俄罗斯煽动了政变</a>。<em>布隆伯格</em>将这次政变报道为“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-08-03/niger-coup-the-long-arm-of-russia-and-the-politics-of-uranium?leadSource=uverify%20wall">克里姆林宫的长臂</a>”的最新证据。 <em>《新闻周刊》</em>宣称，尼日尔的政变意味着“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/countdown-next-great-war-has-begun-africa-1817095">非洲下一场大战已经开始倒计时</a>”。<br><br>俄罗斯可能会因为尼日尔政变而扩大影响力（有报道称<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/niger-coup-wagner-group-junta-leaders-president-africa-regional-bloc-rcna98306">军政府正在向瓦格纳集团雇佣兵寻求帮助</a>）。但迄今为止，关于俄罗斯参与程度的猜测大多基于极其薄弱的证据——在一个面积是法国两倍的国家，在一个城市的一次抗议中，有数百人举行抗议活动，其中少数人举着俄罗斯国旗。拥有超过 2500 万人口。即使在政变之前，尼日尔的首都也是反对派的据点，因此，居住在那里的一些人举行示威以支持推翻他们厌恶的总统的士兵也就不足为奇了。<br><br>政变背后的推动力很可能是复杂、微妙的，与其说是克里姆林宫的因素，不如说是国内动态的因素。更平庸的当地事业的可能性并不能消除许多尼日尔人对法国的真正愤怒，也不能消除一些人不得不转向俄罗斯作为明显反西方的替代国际赞助商的误导性冲动。但当地媒体报道的对政变发生原因的简单解释似乎是正确的。<br><br>现任总统穆罕默德·巴祖姆一直<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-66324875">计划解雇</a>指挥精锐总统卫队的阿卜杜拉哈曼·奇亚尼将军。既然政变已经发生，奇亚尼将军不会被解雇。相反，他宣布自己是新军政府的领导人，该军政府自称为国家保卫祖国委员会。<br><br>奥卡姆剃刀的解释可能是正确的：一位即将被解雇的将军决定解雇总统。许多政变都有这样简单的起源故事，由军队内部的派系斗争以及雄心勃勃、自私自利的人引发，他们乐意将军营换成宫殿。<br><br>无论他赌博的原因是什么，奇亚尼很可能没有预料到他自掌权以来所面临的强烈反对。大多数国际参与者，包括俄罗斯，都谴责了这次政变（尽管克里姆林宫关于尊重宪法的声明最好持保留态度）。也许对奇亚尼计划最令人惊讶的威胁来自于一个主要的区域权力掮客——西非国家经济共同体。以尼日利亚为最强大成员的西非15个国家联盟对政变采取了强硬立场，甚至<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://apnews.com/article/niger-abuja-niamey-ecowas-coup-bazoum-explainer-33a6c0fa7396a90f7b78b0310ae20b32">威胁进行军事干预</a>。一些人因此将西非经共体描绘成<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://peoplesdispatch.org/2023/08/03/peoples-movements-oppose-west-backed-military-intervention-by-ecowas-in-niger/">西方的傀儡</a>，是欧美矛头的锋利末端。<br><br>再一次，一个更简单（且地缘政治方面不那么令人兴奋）的解释可能是正确的。西非国家经济共同体可能不会对这次政变采取强硬立场，因为它是一个木偶，或者因为它在意识形态上厌恶弗拉基米尔·普京；其成员国政府可能只是关心自身的自我保护。<br><br> “地区总统对军事干预感兴趣的一个原因是，他们越来越害怕自己被除掉，”伯明翰大学非洲政治专家尼克·奇斯曼教授说。 “在此之前，该地区发生了其他几起政变，他们意识到，如果他们不划清界限，他们可能就是下一个政变的受害者。”<br><br>尼日尔的政变可能并非源于大国竞争，而是源于政治和其他近在眼前的动态，但它仍然可能产生严重的国际影响。随着<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/violent-extremism-sahel">圣战主义抬头</a>，萨赫勒地区的安全局势正在恶化。事实证明，过去三年上台的军政府无力与之抗衡。此外，尽管许多新的军事政权——特别是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/3/malian-minister-says-russia-will-ship-food-and-fuel-to-mali-in-coming-weeks">马里</a>和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/burkina-faso-interim-leader-hails-russia-strategic-ally-2023-05-05/">布基纳法索</a>——已经与俄罗斯结盟，但俄罗斯政府和瓦格纳集团并没有足够的闲钱，也没有大量训练有素的军队等待部署到非洲，他们因乌克兰的惨败而陷入困境。在接下来的几个月里，萨赫勒地区的政变后政权可能会意识到，他们已经将财力雄厚且长期致力于提供外援的西方伙伴换成了一个衰弱的克里姆林宫，而克里姆林宫将不可避免地承诺过多而兑现不足。钱最终会用完。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/07/russian-disinformation-africa-food-crisis/670570/">大卫·帕特里卡拉科斯：俄罗斯的饥饿战</a><br><br>欧洲也参与其中：主要由核能提供动力的法国大约<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://blogs.law.ox.ac.uk/research-subject-groups/centre-criminology/centreborder-criminologies/blog/2020/05/niger-other-eu">萨赫勒边界</a>”，关闭了经尼日尔通往地中海的移民通道。政变可能会重新开放这条路线，重振以前繁荣的阿加德兹交通枢纽。美国也关心阿加德兹：美国无人机基地尼日尔 201 空军基地就位于该镇外。<br><br>如果尼日尔军政府设法继续掌权，它几乎肯定会与俄罗斯结盟。临时政权已经宣布<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/aug/03/niger-coup-junta-joe-biden-mohamed-bazoum">取消与法国的多项军事协议</a>。但如果它向克里姆林宫示好，它就会猛然醒悟。正如马里和布基纳法索所发现的那样，俄罗斯有足够的财富来支付小规模雇佣军的费用，并满足贪婪士兵的腰包，但它还远远不够富有，无法为世界上最贫穷的国家之一的更广泛的人口提供食物。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=XL&amp;most_recent_value_desc=false">人均GDP</a>低于600美元的国家。<br><br>正如撒哈拉以南非洲地区经常发生的情况一样，受害者将是那些最无法忍受的人。随着士兵变身政客致富，尼日尔更广泛的民众将遭受苦难。这个故事与地缘政治无关，而是关于数百万弱势群体的普通痛苦，其墨水量将大大减少。<br><br></div>

(Jason Aldean) 说“在小镇尝试一下”庆祝社区，但它的文字和声音讲述了一个不同的故事。 <br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> 《大西洋月刊》的照片插图。资料来源：埃德·罗德/盖蒂；约翰希勒/盖蒂；迈克尔·洛西萨诺/盖蒂。</figcaption></figure>乡村音乐是一种具有百年历史的怀旧、传统和乡音音乐流派，其风格从未如此流行。上周，<em>公告牌</em>百强单曲榜历史上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/chart-beat/jason-aldean-try-that-in-a-small-town-number-one-hot-100-country-hits-top-three-1235382220/">首次</a>出现美国最受欢迎的三首乡村歌曲。对于这一里程碑的一个解释是，该流派的艺术家和观众最终<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.billboard.com/pro/country-music-consumption-up-2023-morgan-wallen/">倾向于</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://variety.com/2023/music/news/cmts-morgan-wallen-country-streaming-march-1235573629/">流媒体</a>：今年，乡村音乐的听众人数增长了 20%，增幅仅次于拉丁音乐和韩国流行音乐。<br><br>但这是一场值得庆祝的奇怪胜利，不仅因为上周排名第一的歌曲杰森·阿尔丁（Jason Aldean）的《在小镇尝试》（Try That in a Small Town）已被证明是一个政治热点。现在突破的曲目每首听起来都不像<em>乡村</em>音乐。这种流派总是传达出一定程度的失败者的反抗，但最近，音乐和围绕它的对话有一种明显的怨恨色彩。<br><br>在《在小镇尝试一下》中，46 岁的佐治亚州流行音乐制作人阿尔丁向所谓的乡村价值观（荣誉、邻里关系、拥有枪支）致敬，警告听众所谓的城市病态（抢劫、向警察吐口水、焚烧旗帜） ）不要乘坐某些人所说的“ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2016/06/a-note-about-trumpism-from-the-real-america/623689/">真正的美国</a>”。 “在这里，我们照顾自己的事情，”他夸口道。但音乐很难让人想起宁静的牧场或布满锯末的酒吧。当我听到这首歌中低沉的吉他声、低沉的小和弦以及从 Foo Fighters 的《Everlong》中摘录的即兴重复段时，我感觉自己回到了 2000 年左右的郊区男性青春期——那时我穿着一件超大的黑色连帽衫，聆听带有灵魂补丁的男人的呻吟。 Aldean 的歌曲名义上是乡村歌曲，但其声音却是后垃圾摇滚另类摇滚。<br><br> 90 年代初，Nirvana 及其同侪为一种新的主​​流男子气概开辟了空间：容易受到失败和疏远感的影响，但又带有一种硬朗、嘈杂的边缘，没有人会认为这是<em>娘娘腔</em>。很快，一群<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2018/07/linkin-park-chester-bennington/561713/">旋律优美的</a>乐队出现了，比如 Bush、Creed 和 Nickelback，他们剪掉了朋克风格中的垃圾摇滚，为漫无目的的焦虑创造了一个广泛吸引人的模板。现在，阿尔丁用踏板钢和右翼谈话要点更新了该模板。<br><br>你可能听说过<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/07/jason-aldean-donald-trump/674842/">这首歌是有争议的</a>。阿尔丁设置了一个完美的话语陷阱，利用了美国当前在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/12/historians-clash-1619-project/604093/">其自身历史的两种理论</a>之间的分裂，以及强烈反对与反对之间循环的可预测性和盈利能力。尽管这首歌没有提及种族，但许多听众在其中听到了狗哨声：阿尔丁歌词所认可的“好男孩”私刑主义在历史上一直与<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2022/02/america-lynching-history-reckoning/621320/">白人至上主义暴力</a>联系在一起。他的音乐录影带包含“黑人生命也是命”抗议者的图像（尽管该片段<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/25/jason-aldean-controversial-music-video-edited/">后来被剪辑掉</a>），并在 1927 年田纳西州法院前拍摄，一名黑人在那里被私刑处决。（制作该视频的制作公司告诉<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/2023/07/20/jason-aldean-song-video-pulled-cmt-controversy/"><em>《华盛顿邮报》</em></a>说它选择了“纳什维尔以外的热门拍摄地点。”）但对这首歌的批评只会放大它：乡村音乐电视台禁止该视频后，该曲目的流媒体量<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2023/jul/24/jason-aldean-small-town-song-streaming-increase">猛增了 999%</a> 。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2018/04/jason-aldean-rearview-town-las-vegas/557876/">阅读：哀悼的音乐，无论它愿意与否</a><br><br>阿尔丁声称对他挑起的骚乱感到困惑。他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Jason_Aldean/status/1681382697875144717?lang=en">说</a>，这首歌只是“代表了我成长过程中对社区的感受”。 （无论如何，阿尔丁是在佐治亚州梅肯市的中等城市长大的。）这种坚持，比阿尔丁声音中南方轻快的声音更能让田径运动变得<em>乡村化</em>。阿尔丁所遵循的音乐传统是蔑视城市，同时颂扬乡村的干劲。但他并没有像梅尔·哈格德（Merle Haggard）的《Okie From Muskogee》那样讽刺而勇敢地演唱，甚至不像小汉克·威廉姆斯（Hank Williams Jr.）的《乡村男孩能生存》（A Country Boy Can Survive）那样生硬自信。他也没有像<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/11/toby-keith-the-bus-songs/540654/">托比·基思那样</a>发出挑衅性的口号。相反，阿尔丁听起来以一种明显的后垃圾摇滚方式沉迷和恐惧——尽管他的言语表明了行动。<br><br>也许这种升华的焦虑氛围反映了歌曲背后的悲剧：美国小镇长达数十年的经济衰退。阿尔丁感叹的大城市问题—— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thirdway.org/report/the-two-decade-red-state-murder-problem">暴力犯罪</a>、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/05/23/how-my-hometown-produced-jan-6-sedition-suspect/">煽动叛乱</a>，甚至<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2017/10/small-town-economies-culture/543138/">社区关系破裂</a>——在许多情况下，城市外的问题比城市内更严重。这一现实是右翼怨恨的主要驱动力，而与之相关的音乐无论如何都应该带有一丝不安。阿尔丁此前以无忧无虑的乡村生活赞歌而闻名（尽管他 2018 年的单曲《后景小镇》看起来几乎像是乡村梦想的挽歌，但实际上是一首分手歌曲）。 《Small Town》的一个更好的先例是 Staind 2001 年的热门单曲《It&#39;s Been Awhile》：“已经有一段时间了/自从我能昂首挺胸以来。”并非巧合的是，斯坦德的亚伦·刘易斯现在是一位受欢迎的乡村音乐家，也是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article252897928.html">人们记忆中最有影响力的右翼抗议歌手</a>之一。<br><br>摩根·沃伦 (Morgan Wallen) 是 Nickelback 的精神之子，这也并非巧合。摩根·沃伦目前是最受欢迎的乡村音乐人，也是上周热门 100 强歌曲《最后一夜》(Last Night) 的歌手。这支加拿大摇滚乐队以朗朗上口的《How You Remind Me》和《Photograph》而闻名，经常被嘲笑<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2012/09/rahm-emanuel-saves-reputation-renounces-nickelback/323749/">为音乐平淡的终极典范</a>。但沃伦毫无歉意地指出该组织的影响力。他的首选制作人乔伊·莫伊 (Joey Moi) 制作了 Nickelback 2000 年代早期的许多热门歌曲，其中包括《Photograph》，然后与他人共同创立了 Big Loud，该公司现在是纳什维尔最热门的唱片公司之一。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/07/country-music-pandemic-protests-the-chicks-gaslighter/614092/">阅读：乡村音乐不能再隐藏它的问题</a><br><br>Wallen 是一位 30 岁的前<em>《好声音》</em>参赛者，是一位严肃的流行音乐天才，而《Last Night》（自 2 月份发行以来就引起轰动）非常出色（这也解释了为什么它取代了 Aldean 的歌曲登上了 Hot 100 的榜首）今天）。制作的层压性质以及歌手表达对自己的轻微仇恨的方式有一点五分钱乐队的品质，但“最后一夜”主要体现了纳什维尔的一种独立趋势：所谓的嘻哈、现代乡村受到说唱的影响。沃伦用轻快的吉他循环和拍手形成切分节拍，以时髦的口音唱着醉酒的争斗与和解，散发着与德雷克相同的低俗魅力。这里的讽刺是显而易见的：2021 年，沃伦被发现在镜头前说出 N 字词，这导致了一场所谓的“取消”，就像阿尔丁的那样，只会增加他的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/02/morgan-wallen/618137/">听众数量</a>。<br><br>上周全国排名第三的歌曲是卢克·库姆斯 (Luke Combs) 对特雷西·查普曼 (Tracy Chapman) 的《Fast Car》的演绎，也引起了一些争议。它基本上是 1991 年经典歌曲的逐音符翻唱，主要区别在于库姆斯粗犷而优美的声音。上个月它在排行榜上开始上升后，一些评论员<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/arts-entertainment/2023/07/13/tracy-chapman-luke-combs-fast-car-cover/">指出</a>，查普曼和其他黑人女性都没有在乡村音乐领域取得过库姆斯所享受的那种成功。这一观察激起了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-another-week-another-country-music-star-falsely-accused-racism">保守派的不满</a>，这比最初的批评更强烈，可能会提高这首歌的受欢迎程度。正如我的同事康纳·弗里德斯多夫（Conor Friedersdorf） <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/why-is-tracy-chapman-at-the-center-of-a-country-music-controversy/674794/">所说</a>，围绕这首歌的讨论表明，媒体对种族的报道可能会引发更多的混乱，而不是改革。<br><br>但要求这种注重真实性、纯美国风格的观察者避免谈论明显的事实是否站得住脚？上周乡村音乐席卷<em>Billboard</em> Hot 100 的事实是显而易见的。音乐多种多样，但表演者却不然：在阿尔丁的抗议摇滚、沃伦悠闲的说唱流和库姆斯的灵魂民谣翻唱之间，主流乡村音乐的繁荣不是源于声音，而是源于白人、男性和——至少在阿尔丁的例子中——受屈的身份。当然，所有类型都是由人口统计数据定义的。但流媒体技术，更不用说社交和政治媒体，现在奖励了煽动多元化的激情，包括播下分裂的种子。煽动斯坦对斯坦，或右对左，可以证明是有利可图的——至少在短时间内是这样（阿尔丁的歌曲今天在百强单曲榜上从第 1 名跌至第 21 名）。<br><br>其他流派的艺术家将从这一繁荣中吸取教训。就在几天前，阿尔丁出人意料地出现在纳什维尔举行的五分钱乐队音乐会上。 Nickelback 的主唱查德·克罗格 (Chad Kroeger) 从来不因其政治直言不讳而闻名。但那天晚上，他<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-advertisers-convinced-americans-they-smelled-bad-12552404/">棉团或橡胶来</a>吸收汗水。没有医学理由的人们选择用肉毒杆菌来麻痹他们的出汗神经。就连李小龙也在 1973 年去世前几个月，<a

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248417303652?via%3Dihub">长距离奔跑</a>；没有它，我们就无法在高温下长距离奔跑。我们将无法为我们的大大脑和身体提供动力；我们不会殖民地球上那么多地方。宾夕法尼亚大学的汗水研究员雅娜·坎贝罗夫（Yana Kamberov）说，我们甚至可能要感谢（或归咎于）我们皮肤的裸露。她的团队最近尚未发表的数据表明，随着人类皮肤进化产生越来越多的汗腺，制造毛皮的毛囊消失以腾出空间。马萨诸塞州文理学院的生物人类学家安德鲁·贝斯特认为，汗水是人类进化的“关键里程碑”之一，与大大脑、直立行走以及通过语言和艺术表达文化同等重要。<br><br>人类并不是唯一会出汗的动物。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248417303652?via%3Dihub">许多哺乳动物</a>——其中包括狗、猫和老鼠——通过爪子上的足垫出汗。黑猩猩、猕猴和其他灵长类动物都被汗腺覆盖。即使是马和骆驼也会在炎热的天气里把皮肤打滑。但只有我们的身体布满了数百万个微小的管状汗腺——大约是其他灵长类动物皮肤上数量的 10 倍——它们将血液中的水分输送到毛孔中，可以挤出<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK236237/">三、四</a><a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2023/08/drinking-water-hydration-amount-importance/674926/">——流失太多</a>，中暑和死亡的风险就会急剧上升。我们缺乏皮毛也使我们更容易被咬伤和烧伤。贝斯特告诉我，人类无论如何都会出汗，这证明了出汗具有降温作用——它比仅仅喘气或躲避炎热要有效得多。 “如果你的目标是能够在温暖的条件下维持高代谢率，出汗绝对是<em>最好的</em>，”他说。<br><br> <a

(Angela Lamb) 说。但对 BO 的哀叹早在美国出现之前就有其文化根源。 “我读过很久以前的讨论，其中有关于腋窝臭的人的讨论，”布法罗大学历史学家卡里·卡斯蒂尔说。到了 20 世纪初，最近流行的细菌理论让美国人开始害怕肮脏——这是营销人员“把恐惧先放在女性身上，然后是男性身上，担心出汗会破坏你的浪漫计划的最佳时机”。或者一份工作，” <a

亿美元的市场</a>。<br><br>我们对出汗的厌恶在进化上没有多大意义。与其他引起几乎所有人厌恶的排泄物不同，汗水通常不会传播疾病或造成其他伤害。但它确实会引起体力劳动和情绪压力——这两种情况都是上流社会通常不愿意看到的。密歇根大学生物人类学家蒂娜·拉西西 (Tina Lasisi) 表示，对某些人来说，这可能意味着“以某种特定方式失去对身体的控制”。与尿液或眼泪不同，汗水是身体机能的产物，我们无法训练自己抑制或延迟这种机能。<br><br>我们也讨厌出汗，因为我们认为它闻起来很难闻。但事实并非如此。人体上几乎所有的汗腺都属于所谓的小汗腺类型，并且产生微咸的水，几乎没有气味。腋窝和腹股沟等少数部位长满了顶浆分泌腺，这些腺体会产生一种含有信息素的蜡质脂肪物质，但即使是<em>这种物质</em>也没有固有的气味。我们皮肤上的细菌会吃掉它，它们的排泄物会产生恶臭，让汗水成为替罪羊。贝斯特告诉我，我们人类的排汗方式甚至可能让我们“没有原本应有的臭味”。全身小汗腺的扩张可能不仅使我们的皮肤变得更加裸露，而且使我们的皮肤变得更加裸露。人们还认为它<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0047248417303652?via%3Dihub">驱逐了一大群产生 BO 的大汗腺</a>。<br><br>随着全球气温上升，对于许多人来说，尤其是在世界上缺乏空调的地区，出汗将是不可避免的。 “我怀疑每个人都会浑身湿透，”坎贝罗夫告诉我。然而，我们每个人究竟会变得多么狡猾，谁也说不准。专家有证据表明<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3328&amp;context=dissertations_2">男性比女性出汗更多，而且排汗潜力随着年龄的增长而下降</a>。但总的来说，他们无法确定为什么有些人<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306456519302645?via%3Dihub">天生就比其他人更爱出汗</a>，以及其中有多少是天生的。几十年前，一位日本研究人员假设，出汗潜力可能会<a data-event-element="inline link"

度的天气可能比秋天感觉更热，甚至更容易出汗的部分原因。<br><br>但我们不能简单地通过流汗来摆脱气候束缚。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2023/07/18/extreme-heat-record-limits-human-survival/">我们可以忍受的温度是有上限的</a>；身体一次只能滤出一定量的液体。在潮湿的条件下，当液体无法轻易从皮肤上蒸发时，汗液的冷却能力也会减弱。研究人员也无法预测未来几代人是否会进化到比我们现在出汗更多。我们不再生活在迫使我们的祖先长出更多汗腺的严酷条件下——这种变化也发生了数百万年。我们甚至有可能正在快速接近灵长类动物身体所能产生的最大湿度。 “我们对这种可塑性的外部极限并没有很好的了解，”马萨诸塞大学阿默斯特分校的生物人类学家贾森·卡米拉尔告诉我。<br><br>里蒂告诉我，目前，那些已经出汗较多的人可能会发现自己更有能力应对变暖的世界。最后：潮湿的人有福了，因为他们将继承地球。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 08 Aug 2023 14:04:03

Dodds)在<em>《卫报》的</em>一篇简短评论专栏中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jul/24/labour-will-lead-on-reform-of-transgender-rights-and-we-wont-take-lectures-from-the-divisive-tories">宣布了这一转变</a>。在短短800多字的时间里，她做出了三项重大宣言。一是“性别和性别是不同的”。另一个问题是，尽管工党仍然相信改变个人法定性别的权利，但仍需要采取保障措施来“保护妇女和女孩免受可能滥用该制度的掠夺者的侵害”。最后，工党因此放弃了对自我身份的承诺——即简单的在线声明就足以出于各种目的改变某人的法定性别——并将保留当前对性别不安进行医学诊断的要求。<br><br>多兹在她的文章中补充了几条解释性推文，但没有在电视上重申这一信息。第二天，工党拒绝提供发言人对

LGBTQ 活动人士坚持<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://helenlewis.substack.com/p/the-bluestocking-starmers-secret">不张扬却冷酷无情</a>。与许多美国政治家不同，他试图找到一种立场，使辩论不那么煽动，并吸引更广泛的国家而不是他的激进派基础。<br><br>自从保守党<a data-event-element="inline link"

Two days after the Dodds column appeared, Starmer <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lbc.co.uk/news/keir-starmer-woman-adult-female-trans-labour-party/">was asked</a> to define <em>woman</em> . He responded simply, “An adult female.” If that answer is permissible in left-wing circles, interviewers have been deprived of an easy gotcha question, and Labour can go back to talking about economics and trying to win over the median voter.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">For fear of</span> harming trans people or aligning with outright bigots, some on the left have avoided voicing misgivings about policies such as self-ID, and over the past decade Labour activists have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/f/wpuk-fringe-report">vilified</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/labour-officials-quit-in-transgender-row-06qtj2b3r">feminist commentators</a> who did speak up. Starmer has now broadened the limits of the discussion. Across Europe, medical associations are recommending <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/texas-puberty-blockers-gender-care-transgender-rights/673941/">caution</a> over so-called affirmative models of gender care for minors. The possibility that social contagion may affect teenagers&#39; professed identities is being <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.academie-medecine.fr/la-medecine-face-a-la-transidentite-de-genre-chez-les-enfants-et-les-adolescents/?lang=en">discussed</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bmj.com/content/376/bmj.o629/rr-1">among doctors</a> , as is the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bmj.com/company/newsroom/gender-dysphoria-in-young-people-is-rising-and-so-is-professional-disagreement/">suggestion</a> that, at least in some cases, puberty itself can resolve gender dysphoria.

Two weeks before that, cycling&#39;s world governing body, the Union Cycliste Internationale, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.skysports.com/more-sports/other-sports/news/15264/12921233/uci-to-ban-transgender-women-from-participating-in-female-cycling-events-under-new-policy#:~:text=The%20policy%20created%20an%20'open,yet%20to%20begin%20hormone%20therapy.">restricted</a> the female category to individuals born female who have never taken testosterone, while also creating an “open” competition for anyone who has been through male puberty or has taken male hormones.<br><br> In the United States, though, political polarization is freezing a highly unproductive discussion in place. One of the most frustrating aspects of writing on this subject is that many liberals don&#39;t know what they don&#39;t know. Punitive red-state bans, coupled with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/ron-desantis-cnn-interview/674751/">overtly anti-LGBTQ rhetoric</a> by Republicans, have made Democrats instinctively defensive of puberty blockers and gender surgery for minors even as European experts grow warier. A proper, evidence-based debate about child transition in America is inhibited by the fact that medical groups are wedded to the affirmative model, despite their overseas colleagues&#39; qualms about the evidence base. The board of the American Academy of Pediatrics just <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/03/health/aap-gender-affirming-care-evidence-review.html">voted unanimously</a> to continue backing the affirmative approach for now.<br><br> Clearly, a broad middle ground exists. About three-quarters of Americans are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/education/2023/05/05/trans-poll-gop-politics-laws/">opposed</a> to discrimination against transgender people in housing, colleges, the workplace, and obtaining health insurance, according to polling conducted late last year. But more than 60 percent of American adults also believe that trans women and girls should not compete in female sports at any level, and solid majorities also oppose hormone treatments for under-18s. Even among trans adults themselves, the same poll found that three in 10 support sex-based restrictions in sports, and the same number said it was inappropriate for younger children to receive puberty blockers. ( <em>The</em> <em>Washington Post</em> , which published the polling, notes that it was conducted before the introduction of hundreds of red-state bills restricting medical care and sports participation.) It seems as though most Americans are happy to support trans people in everyday life, while also believing that trans women are not identical to other women, with all that implies. But this position is rarely articulated among elites on either side. “It&#39;s not just tribalism; it&#39;s extremism,” the writer Lisa Selin Davis told me. “It&#39;s the two-party system, and it&#39;s each party catering to its most radical constituents. And of course, that&#39;s the story of social media too.”<br><br> Davis came to the American gender debate as the parent of a masculine daughter. When she wrote about that experience in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/opinion/my-daughter-is-not-transgender-shes-a-tomboy.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a> , she received letters urging her to let her “son” transition and warning that “he” might die by suicide otherwise. She still considers herself to be on the left but believes that her natural allies have lost perspective. “When it comes to the Democrats, they have invested so much political capital in supporting things that not only probably don&#39;t matter to most Democratic voters, but I think probably are a bit of a turnoff,” she told me. “Staking your claim on supporting drag-queen story hour, as opposed to a $25 minimum wage, is really silly.”<br><br> Davis is particularly dispirited that Democrats do not make life easy for lawmakers who depart from the party&#39;s orthodoxy on gender issues. Shawn Thierry, a Black female Democratic state representative in Texas, faced censure motions and a primary challenge after <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/houston-democrat-transgender-care-ban-18100564.php">supporting</a> a Republican bill to limit gender-related hormone therapies to people over 18. Her Democratic colleagues accused her of parroting GOP talking points, but she insisted that she had looked at the evidence and found it wanting. Her detractors were also unhappy that she met with two detransitioners ahead of the vote. Imagine that—a lawmaker being criticized for listening to people with personal experience of the issue under discussion.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/detransition-transgender-nonbinary-gender-affirming-care/672745/">Daniela Valdes and Kinnon MacKinnon: Take detransitioners seriously</a><br><br> Deviations from the Republican Party line also attract ferocious pushback. In 2021, Asa Hutchinson, then the governor of Arkansas, vetoed a child-gender-care bill, drawing criticism from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meetthepressblog/tucker-carlson-asa-hutchinson-tussle-transgender-rights-vaccines-rcna94305">Tucker Carlson</a> and the state party. But Hutchinson gave a compelling rationale: He opposed surgeries on minors but felt the bill was unconstitutional and deprived parents of their rights. (His veto was overturned, but the law has since been <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/judge-strikes-gender-affirming-care-ban-arkansas/story?id=100257964">struck down</a> by a judge.) Earlier this year, Utah Governor Spencer Cox <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://news.yahoo.com/disagree-better-utah-governor-wants-143000349.html">approved</a> restrictions on transition care in his state only <em>after</em> meeting with families affected by the change, telling reporters: “If you&#39;re not willing to sit down and listen to transgender kids and their families, then you&#39;re probably doing policy the wrong way.” Cox is now using his year as chair of the National Governors Association to promote an initiative called Disagree Better.<br><br> Here in Britain, Starmer is betting that most voters will gratefully accept his proposed compromise—one that both assuages their concerns and takes some of the heat out of the debate. Labour has made concessions to trans activists, too, by proposing a system that will allow patients to receive a dysphoria diagnosis from their family doctor, rather than having to apply to an anonymous panel. Starmer has so far declined <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2023/07/25/keir-starmer-owes-rosie-duffield-an-apology/">to apologize</a> on the party&#39;s behalf to feminists who were harassed for views that Labour now officially shares.<br><br> Frankly, treating this as a tough but mundane problem to be solved rather than an emotive means of attacking the opposition is what is needed. It&#39;s the only way to make the American conversation around gender more like the British one. Democrats need to meet detransitioners, and Republicans need to meet transgender activists. Both sides need to hear the best version of their opponents&#39; arguments—and ensure that the debate is being conducted on the basis of the best available evidence. Alongside any evidence reviews, Davis wants a bipartisan commission on child gender care. “The best thing to do would be to stop fighting and get the data,” she said.<br><br> Until then, the left must be able to defend trans rights without denying the meaningful differences between males and females. The right must be able to air concerns without demonizing trans people. Both liberals and conservatives should stop throwing around accusations of child abuse toward parents doing their best. The gender war can end—if the broad, tolerant middle asserts itself.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 08 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/uk-trans-rights-labour-party/674944/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/uk-trans-rights-labour-party/674944/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Local-News Crisis Is Weirdly Easy to Solve]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Restoring the journalism jobs lost over the past 20 years wouldn&#39;t just be cheap—it would pay for itself. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/OxjtWxqBQ3MegS-BPLwSTdRukEI=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/local_news_final_horz/original.jpg" alt="a newspaper-dispenser box full of money" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Ben Kothe / The Atlantic.

He did not discover secret torture sites or expose abuses by a powerful religious institution. But there was something about this one article he wrote as a reporter for <i>The Salt Lake Tribune</i> in 2019 that changed my conception of the value of local news.<br><br> Podmore, then a staff journalist for the <i>Tribune</i> and a corps member of Report for America, a nonprofit I co-founded, published a story <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sltrib.com/news/2019/07/28/san-juan-county-paid/">revealing</a> that San Juan County, Utah, had paid a single law firm hundreds of thousands of dollars in lobbying fees. Among other things, Podmore found that the firm had overcharged the county, the poorest in the state, by $109,500. Spurred by his story, the firm paid the money back. Perhaps because it didn&#39;t involve billions of dollars, but rather a more imaginable number, it struck me: In one story, Podmore had retrieved for the county a sum that was triple his annual salary.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/11/alden-global-capital-killing-americas-newspapers/620171/">From the November 2021 Issue: A secretive hedge fund is gutting newsrooms</a><br><br> You&#39;ve probably read about the collapse of local news over the past two decades. On average, two newspapers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://localnewsinitiative.northwestern.edu/research/state-of-local-news/report/">close</a> each week. Some 1,800 communities that used to have local news now <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/news-deserts-and-ghost-newspapers-will-local-news-survive/the-news-landscape-in-2020-transformed-and-diminished/">don&#39;t</a> . Many of the papers still hanging on are forced to make do with skeleton staffs as their owners, often private-equity firms, seek to cut costs. The number of newspaper newsroom employees dropped by 57 percent from 2008 to 2020, according to a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/07/13/u-s-newsroom-employment-has-fallen-26-since-2008/">Pew Research study</a> , leading to thousands of “ghost newspapers” that barely cover their community.<br><br> For the past 15 years, I have been part of an effort to reverse this trend. That means I&#39;ve grown used to talking about the threat that news deserts pose to American democracy. After all, the whole concept of democratic self-government depends on the people knowing what public officials are up to. That&#39;s impossible without a watchdog press. Researchers have linked the decline of local news to decreased voter participation and higher rates of corruption, along with increased polarization and more ideologically extreme elected officials. At this point, I can make high-minded speeches about this stuff in my sleep, with Thomas Jefferson quotes and everything. Recently, however, I&#39;ve come to realize that I have been ignoring a less lofty but perhaps more persuasive argument: Funding local news would more than pay for itself.<br><br> Unlike other seemingly intractable problems, the demise of local news wouldn&#39;t cost very much money to reverse. Journalists are not particularly well compensated. Assuming an average salary of $60,000 (generous by industry standards), it would cost only about $1.5 billion a year to sustain 25,000 local-reporter positions, a rough estimate of the number that have disappeared nationwide over the past two decades. That&#39;s two-hundredths of a percent of federal spending in 2022. I personally think this would be an amount well worth sacrificing to save American democracy. But the amazing thing is that it wouldn&#39;t really be a sacrifice at all. If more public or philanthropic money were directed toward sustaining local news, it would most likely produce financial benefits many times greater than the cost.<br><br> What do government officials do when no one&#39;s watching? Often, they enrich themselves or their allies at the taxpayers&#39; expense. In the 2000s, some years after its local paper shut down, the city of Bell, California, a low-income, overwhelmingly Latino community, raised the pay of the city manager to $787,637 and that of the police chief to $457,000. The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> eventually <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/local/la-me-bell-salary-20100715-story.html">exposed</a> the graft, and several city officials ended up in prison. Prosecutors accused them of costing taxpayers at least $5.5 million through their inflated salaries. These salaries were approved at municipal meetings, which is to say that if even one reporter (say, with a salary of $60,000) had been in attendance, the city might have saved millions of dollars.<br><br> Sometimes the work of journalists prompts government investigations into the private sector, which, in turn, produce fines that go into the public&#39;s bank account. After the <i>Tampa Bay Times</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tampabay.com/investigations/2022/05/09/tampa-bay-times-reporters-win-pulitzer-prize-for-poisoned-series/">found</a> that a battery recycler was exposing its employees and the surrounding community to high levels of lead and other toxins, regulators fined the company $800,000. A ProPublica <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/sec-issues-more-fines-over-magnetar-deals-and-appears-to-move-on">investigation</a> into one firm&#39;s questionable mortgage-backed securities prompted investigations by the Security and Exchange Commission, which ultimately assessed $435 million in fines. A review of more than 12,000 entries in the Investigative Reporters and Editors Awards found that about one in 10 triggered fines from the government, and twice as many prompted audits.<br><br> In other cases, local-news organizations return money directly to consumers by forcing better behavior from private institutions. MLK50, a local newsroom in Memphis, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/what-happens-after-a-debt-collection-machine-grinds-to-a-halt">teamed up</a> with ProPublica to report that Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare had sued more than 8,300 people, many of them poor, for unpaid hospital bills. In response, the faith-based institution erased nearly $12 million in debt.<br><br> Of course, most journalism does not convert quite so immediately into cash on hand. The impacts may be enormous but indirect. One study of toxic emissions at 40,000 plants <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0095069616301371">found</a> that when newspapers reported on pollution, emissions declined by 29 percent compared with plants that were not covered. The study did not track the ripple effects, but it stands to reason that residents in the less polluted areas would have fewer health problems, which in turn would translate to lower medical costs and less lost work time. Another <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3175555">study</a> , by the scholars Pengjie Gao, Chang Lee, and Dermot Murphy, looked at bond offerings in communities with and without local news from 1996 to 2015. It concluded that for each bond offering, the borrowing costs were five to 11 basis points higher in the less covered communities. That translated to additional costs of $650,000 an issue, on average.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/05/local-news-media-trust-americans/618895/">Amanda Ripley: Can the news be fixed?</a><br><br> One academic tried to track the economic effects even further downstream.

The exposé prompted LA County to require restaurants to display their inspection scores, which in turn led to a 13.3 percent drop in LA County hospital admissions for food poisoning. Hamilton estimated a savings of about $148,000. In another case study, Hamilton analyzed a series by the Raleigh <i>News &amp; Observer</i> that found that, because the state criminal-justice system didn&#39;t adequately keep track of those under supervision, 580 people on probation in North Carolina killed someone from 2000 to 2008. After the state implemented reforms, murders committed by people on probation declined. Applying the statistical “value of human life” used by the US Department of Transportation, Hamilton concluded that society saved about $62 million in just the first year after the policy changes. The series cost only about $200,000 to produce.<br><br> Ideally, investment in local news would come from the federal government, which has more freedom to think long-term than cash-strapped states and municipalities do. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rebuildlocalnews.org/">The Rebuild Local News coalition</a> , of which I am president, supports legislation that would provide a refundable tax credit for news organizations that employ local reporters, and a tax break for small businesses that advertise in local news. A <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rebuildlocalnews.org/community-news-small-business-support-act/">new version</a> of the bill was just introduced in the House of Representatives by the Republican Claudia Tenney and the Democrat Suzan DelBene. Civic-minded philanthropists focused on high-impact donations should also put money into local news, given the likely societal returns. It&#39;s impossible to quantify exactly how much money would be generated for government and consumers by restoring the health of local news. But it&#39;s nearly as hard to deny that the investment would pay off handsomely. And the saving-democracy part? Well, that&#39;s just gravy.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 08 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/local-news-investment-economic-value/674942/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/local-news-investment-economic-value/674942/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Killer Apps]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Is social media making America&#39;s murder surge worse? <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/BsZBNpGQ7buWlTQSboDFdaRRL8Q=/258x0:1259x1251/648x810/media/img/2023/08/01/DIS_McGillis_InstaViolence/original.jpg" alt="A hand pointing a gun whose muzzle is shaped like the Instagram logo" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Erik Carter</figcaption></figure> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">, Monday through Friday.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small><br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">ne fall evening in 2020</span> , Jarell Jackson and Shahjahan McCaskill were chatting in Jackson&#39;s Hyundai Sonata, still on a postvacation high, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/west-philadelphia-shootings-homicide-rates-instagram-feuds-20210316.html">when 24 bullets ripped through the car</a> . The two men, both 26, had been close friends since preschool. They&#39;d just returned to West Philadelphia after a few days hang gliding, zip-lining, and hiking in Puerto Rico. Jackson was parked outside his mom&#39;s house when a black SUV pulled up and the people inside started shooting. Both he and McCaskill were pronounced dead at the hospital.<br><br> In the aftermath, McCaskill&#39;s mother, Najila Zainab Ali McCaskill, couldn&#39;t fathom why anyone would want to kill her son and his friend. Both had beaten the odds for young Black men in their neighborhood and graduated from college. Jackson had been a mental-health technician in an adolescent psych ward while her son had run a small cleaning business and tended bar. She wondered if they&#39;d been targeted by a disgruntled former employee of the cleaning business. But then the police explained: Her son and his friend had been killed because of a clash on social media among some teenagers they&#39;d never even met.<br><br> For months, a battle had been raging on Instagram between crews based on either side of Market Street. Theirs was a long-running rivalry, but a barrage of online taunts and threats had raised tensions in the neighborhood. Police had assigned an officer to monitor the social-media activity of various crews in the city, and the department suspected that the Northsiders in the SUV had mistaken one of the two friends for a rival Southsider and opened fire. An hour after the shooting, a Northsider posted a photo on Instagram with a caption that appeared to mock the victims and encourage the rival crew to collect their bodies: “AHH HAAAA Pussy Pick Em Up!!”<br><br> Jackson and McCaskill died in the first year of a nationwide resurgence in violence that has erased more than two decades of gains in public safety. In 2020, homicides spiked by 30 percent and fluctuated around that level for the next two years. There are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/us-murder-rate-decline-crime-statistics/674290/">early signs</a> that the 2023 rate could show a decrease of more than 10 percent from last year, but that would still leave it well above pre-pandemic levels.<br><br> Criminologists point to a confluence of factors, including the social disruptions caused by COVID‑19, the rise in gun sales early in the pandemic, and the uproar following the murder of George Floyd, which, in many cities, led to diminished police activity and further erosion of trust in the police. But in my reporting on the surge, I kept hearing about another accelerant: social media.<br><br> Violence-prevention workers described feuds that started on Instagram, Snapchat, and other platforms and erupted into real life with terrifying speed. “When I was young and I would get into an argument with somebody at school, the only people who knew about it were me and the people at school,” said James Timpson, a violence-prevention worker in Baltimore. “Not right now. Five hundred people know about it before you even leave school. And then you got this big war going on.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/04/american-teens-sadness-depression-anxiety/629524/">Read: Why American teens are so sad</a><br><br> Smartphones and social platforms existed long before the homicide spike; they are obviously not its singular cause. But considering the recent past, it&#39;s not hard to see why social media might be a newly potent driver of violence. When the pandemic led officials to close civic hubs such as schools, libraries, and rec centers for more than a year, people—especially young people—were pushed even further into virtual space. Much has been said about the possible links between heavy social-media use and mental-health problems and suicide among teenagers. Now Timpson and other violence-prevention workers are carrying that concern to the logical next step. If social media plays a role in the rising tendency of young people to harm themselves, could it also be playing a role when they harm others?<br><br> The current spike in violence isn&#39;t a return to &#39;90s-era murder rates—it&#39;s something else entirely. In many cities, the violence has been especially concentrated among the young. The nationwide homicide rate for 15-to-19-year-olds <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db471.htm">increased by an astonishing 91 percent</a> from 2014 to 2021. Last year in Washington, DC, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2022/12/31/homicides-dc-va-md-2022/">105 people under 18 were shot</a> —nearly twice as many as in the previous year. In Philadelphia in the first nine months of 2022, the tally of youth shooting victims—181— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.axios.com/local/philadelphia/2022/10/05/philadelphia-gun-violence-youth-victims">equaled the tally for all of 2015 and 2016 combined</a> . And in Baltimore, more than 60 children ages 13 to 18 were shot in the first half of this year. That&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thebaltimorebanner.com/community/criminal-justice/teen-shootings-gun-violence-baltimore-UW47CTUZVVFCZDMHUVZOY3WGJQ/">double the totals for the first half of each year from 2015 to 2021</a> —and it&#39;s occurred while overall homicides in the city declined. Nationwide, this trend has been racially disproportionate to an extreme degree: In 2021, Black people ages 10 to 24 were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://stacks.cdc.gov/view/cdc/121555">almost 14 times more likely to be the victims of a homicide</a> than young white people.<br><br> Those confronting this scourge—police, prosecutors, intervention workers—are adamant that social-media instigation helps explain why today&#39;s young people are making up a larger share of the victims. But they&#39;re at a loss as to how to combat this phenomenon. They understand that this new wave of killing demands new solutions—but what are they?<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">To the extent</span> that online incitement has drawn attention, it&#39;s been focused on rap videos, particularly those featuring <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/jayquan-mckenley-chii-wvtzz-eric-adams-drill.html#_ga=2.8250674.1462920847.1690910851-270587328.1687895713">drill music</a> , which started in Chicago in the early 2010s and is dominated by explicit baiting of “opps,” or rivals. These videos have been linked to numerous shootings. Often, though, conflict is sparked by more mundane online activity. Teens bait rivals in Instagram posts or are goaded by allies in private chats. On Instagram and Facebook, they livestream incursions into enemy territory and are met by challenges to “drop a pin”—to reveal their location or be deemed a coward. They brandish guns in Snapchat photos or YouTube and TikTok videos, which might provoke an opp to respond—and pressure the person with the gun to actually use it.<br><br> “If you&#39;re not monitoring social media, you&#39;re wondering why 1,000 people are suddenly downtown fighting.”<br><br> In December, I met 21-year-old Brandon Olivieri at the state prison in Houtzdale, Pennsylvania, where he is serving time for murder. In 2017, Olivieri says, he had a run-in with other teens in South Philadelphia after he tried to sell marijuana on their turf. Later, in a private Instagram chat for Olivieri and his friends, someone posted a picture of a silver .45-caliber pistol. Then another member, Nicholas Torelli, posted a picture of cat feces on the sidewalk, with the caption “Brandon took a shit on opp territory.” It was a joke, but the conversation quickly turned aggressive. Later that day, Olivieri asked Torelli to drop an image of their opponents into the chat, so everyone could see what they looked like. Torelli complied, and, according to court records, Olivieri replied that he would “pop all of them.”<br><br> When Olivieri, Torelli, and two friends encountered four of their opponents later that month, there were heated words, a struggle, and three gunshots from the silver pistol. One bullet struck Caleer Miller, a member of Olivieri&#39;s group. Another hit Salvatore DiNubile, in the other crew. Both died; they were 16. Olivieri was convicted of first-degree murder in DiNubile&#39;s death and third-degree murder in Miller&#39;s. (Torelli testified against Olivieri and was not charged.) Olivieri was sentenced to 37 years to life.<br><br> DiNubile&#39;s father, also named Salvatore, believes the ability to share threats online encouraged Olivieri and his friends to make them; having made them, they felt compelled to follow through. “You said you were gonna do this guy. Here&#39;s your chance,” he told me. “You try to live up to this gangster mentality that he&#39;s self-created.” Olivieri maintains his innocence and says that he wasn&#39;t the one who fired the fatal shots, but he agreed that he and his friends often hyped one another up by making boasts online. “It&#39;s what we call pump-faking,” he explained.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Last year,</span> as the number of juvenile shooting victims in Washington, DC, climbed toward triple digits, the city&#39;s Peace Academy, which trains community members in violence prevention, held a Zoom session dedicated to social media. Ameen Beale of the DC Attorney General&#39;s Office shared his screen to display a sequence typical of online flare-ups culminating in a fatality.<br><br> The presentation started with a photo, posted to Instagram in 2019, showing the local rapper AhkDaClicka on the Metro; the caption mocked him for being caught there, without a gun, by adversaries. Then came a screenshot of private messages between AhkDaClicka and a rival rapper named Walkdown Will that the latter posted derisively on Instagram Live. Next, an Instagram Story from AhkDaClicka insulting another rapper who had allegedly been present at the Metro run-in, and a YouTube video of AhkDaClicka <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFxpUO0J9E4">rapping about the incident</a> , including the line “Just give me a Glock and point me to the opps.” Soon afterward, in January 2020, AhkDaClicka was fatally shot. He was 18; his real name was Malick Cisse. That May, police arrested Walkdown Will—William Whitaker, also 18. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder last October.<br><br> Beale&#39;s presentation left some participants dumbfounded. “I cannot believe the level of immaturity and stupidity that&#39;s become the norm,” one wrote in the chat. Another asked the question looming over the session: Had anyone in the city&#39;s violence-prevention realm asked the social-media companies to limit inflammatory content?<br><br> “I don&#39;t think we&#39;ve made much progress,” Beale admitted. When the city had sought to have posts removed, he said, the companies had rebuffed its pleas with vague arguments about free speech. Even if social-media platforms did remove a post, 20 people could already have shared it with hundreds or thousands more. And given the pace of online life, you might spend five years trying to block harmful content on one platform, only for all the activity to migrate to another.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/social-media-teen-mental-health-crisis-research-limitations/674371/">Read: No one knows exactly what social media is doing to teens</a><br><br> I asked a spokesperson for Google, which owns YouTube, about the AhkDaClicka video with the line about the Glock, as well as another video posted last summer, titled “Pull Da Plug.” It showed a Louisville, Kentucky, rapper and about a dozen other young men apparently celebrating a shooting that had left a man on life support (he later died). The head of the Louisville violence-prevention agency had told me that the victim&#39;s family asked Google to remove the video, but it stayed up, collecting more than 15,000 views. The spokesperson, Jack Malon, told me the company generally had a “pretty high threshold” for determining that music videos were inciting violence, in part because company policy <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802268#zippy=%2Cother-types-of-content-that-violate-this-policy">allows exceptions for artistic content</a> .<br><br> My conversations with Malon and his counterparts at Snap and Meta (which owns Facebook and Instagram) left me with the impression that social-media platforms have given relatively little thought to their role in fueling routine gun violence, compared with the higher-profile debate over censoring incendiary political speech. Meta pointed me to its “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/policies/community-standards">community standards</a> ,” which are full of gray-area statements such as “We also try to consider the language and context in order to distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible threat to public or personal safety.” Snap argued that its platform was more benign than others, because posts are designed to disappear and are viewed primarily by one&#39;s friends. I also reached out to TikTok, but the company didn&#39;t respond.<br><br> Communities, meanwhile, have been left to fend for themselves. But violence-prevention groups are dominated by middle-aged men who grew up in the pre-smartphone era; they&#39;re more comfortable intervening in person than deciphering threats on TikTok. Before the pandemic, an intern at Pittsburgh&#39;s main anti-violence organization scanned social-media posts by young people considered at risk of becoming involved in conflicts. The Reverend Cornell Jones, the city government&#39;s liaison to violence-prevention groups, told me that the intern had once detected a feud brewing online among teenagers, some of whom had acquired firearms. Jones brought in the participants and their mothers and defused the situation. Then the intern left town for law school and the organization reverted to the ad hoc methods that are more typical for such groups. “If you&#39;re not monitoring social media, you&#39;re wondering why 1,000 people are suddenly downtown fighting,” Jones said ruefully. In early July, a shooting at a block party in Baltimore validated his concern: Though the event had been discussed widely on social media, no police officers were on hand; later, a video circulated of a teenager showing off what appeared to be a gun at the party. The shooting left two dead and 28 others wounded.<br><br> A decade ago, Desmond Upton Patton, a professor of social policy, communications, and psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania, got the first of several grants to study what he called “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0747563212003779">internet banging</a> .” His research team co-designed algorithms with a team at Columbia University to analyze language, images, and even emoji on Twitter and identify users at risk of harming themselves or others. The algorithms showed promise in identifying escalating online disputes. But he never allowed their use, worried about their resemblance to police surveillance efforts that had enabled profiling more than prevention. “Perhaps there is a smarter person who can figure out how to do it ethically,” he said to me.<br><br> For now, the system is failing to anticipate violence—and even, quite often, to convict people whose social-media feeds incriminate them. In May, three teens were tried for the murders of Jarell Jackson and Shahjahan McCaskill in Philadelphia. At the time of the shooting, two were 17 and the third was 16. Social-media activity formed a key part of the prosecutors&#39; evidence: Instagram posts and video feeds showed the three defendants driving around in a black SUV seemingly identical to the one that had pulled up alongside Jackson&#39;s car. Other posts showed two of them holding a gun that matched the description of one used in the shooting. After a day of deliberations, the jury acquitted them of murder, finding two of the defendants guilty only of weapons charges. The verdict left the victims&#39; families reeling. “For me and my family, [the trial] was like a seven-day funeral,” Monique Jackson, Jarell&#39;s mother, told me. Afterward, the detective who had investigated the murders speculated to her that jurors on such cases often struggle to grasp the basic mechanics of social media and how essential it is to the interactions of young people. As Patton put it to me, “What we underestimate time and time again is that social media isn&#39;t virtual versus real life. This <i>is</i> life.”<br><br> <em><small>This article has been updated to clarify YouTube&#39;s policy for determining which videos are removed for inciting violence.</small></em><br><br> <small><em>This article is a collaboration between</em> The Atlantic <em>and ProPublica.

Sources: Getty; Library of Congress.</figcaption></figure> “I <span class="smallcaps">t&#39;s almost like</span> the government&#39;s imposing its will on its residents,” Trayon White, the DC council member for Ward 8, said at the council&#39;s June 6 legislative meeting. He wasn&#39;t talking about a proposed highway, a subway station, a power plant, or— <em>perish the thought</em> —an apartment building. He was talking about trees: specifically, three linden trees on Xenia Street planted a few years ago by DC&#39;s Urban Forestry Division. To my surprise, the legislative body of a major American city experiencing escalating <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/dc-md-va/2023/05/05/dc-homeless-annual-count/">homelessness</a> and a serious spike in violent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://mpdc.dc.gov/page/district-crime-data-glance">crime</a> dedicated a quarter of its time that day to discussing three trees.<br><br> White said he was concerned about the potential risk to property values and what he sees as a “reasonable fear” that once mature, the trees would “be large enough to make it difficult to see through and around the walkway, which is a public-safety concern.” He asked his colleagues to support an emergency resolution to remove them before this happened.<br><br> For a while, the members carried on as though this were a perfectly normal matter for their attention. A few suggested that perhaps expanding the tree canopy was good, actually. But no one really questioned the underlying premise of White&#39;s proposal: that the community had risen up in dendrophobic opposition.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/07/social-trees-meg-lowman-suzanne-simard/619015/">From the July/August 2021 issue: A better way to look at trees</a><br><br> “We want to note that these are homeowners who are worried about the value of their homes,” White said. “I just believe that [the District Department of Transportation, or DDOT] can be more friendly in responding to the needs of the community with their request, and if they&#39;re requesting different trees, I don&#39;t see what the big problem is.”<br><br> The council went on to debate the merits of the public-safety question. Councilman Kenyan McDuffie recalled that in his ward the city had planted trees in parking spaces so as not to encroach on the already narrow sidewalks. “I still question whether there is the appropriate level of consultation and engagement in the impacted communities,” he said, backing White.<br><br> After more than 20 minutes, the chair of the council noted with surprise that “we spent this much time on the issue of removing three trees.” White, recognizing the lack of sufficient support from his colleagues, withdrew the matter from the agenda, allowing the trees to grow another day.<br><br> What initially drew me to this story was the obvious mismatch between the rhetoric at the council meeting and the subject at hand. How could a few trees constitute a threat to public safety or property values? Were these trees particularly ugly? And <em>who</em> was behind White&#39;s push to get them removed? Like many stories about government, this seemingly trivial drama turned out to be about power, and how people justify using it.<br><br> X <span class="smallcaps">enia Street</span> is in Ward 8, physically separated from most of DC by the Anacostia River. That&#39;s not the only thing that sets it apart. This side of the river is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://censusreporter.org/profiles/61000US11008-ward-8-dc/">overwhelmingly Black</a> and has a higher unemployment rate, a lower labor-force-participation rate, and a higher poverty rate than the rest of the city. The census tract that contains Xenia Street is one of the most heat sensitive in the city, a metric that reflects the prevalence of asthma, coronary heart disease, and disability, as well as racial demographics and income. DC&#39;s Urban Forestry Department, a division of DDOT, planted the trees after a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/resources/pests-diseases/hungry-pests/the-threat/emerald-ash-borer/emerald-ash-borer-beetle#:~:text=The%20Emerald%20Ash%20Borer%20(Agrilus,hidden%20in%20wood%20packing%20materials.">beetle infestation</a> harmed several local ash trees. A senior official told me the department is generally concerned about the unequal distribution of tree canopy across wards: At the end of June, Ward 8 had roughly 500 open requests for new plantings; the higher-income Ward 4 had nearly 6,000.<br><br> Tree planting doesn&#39;t meet the bar for more serious types of notification and community-input processes that a new road or train station might. But according to Kay Armstead, a former member of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission—an elected body meant to serve as a hyperlocal voice on zoning, bike lanes, liquor licenses—the city did inform the commission of a plan to bring more trees to the neighborhood. In the fall of 2020, it planted 35 trees, some American linden, some apple, on a publicly owned lot between two condo buildings, 450 Xenia Street and 450 Condon Terrace.<br><br> I wanted to see the trees for myself. In the weeks following White&#39;s proposed emergency resolution, I visited the quiet residential street on three separate occasions, asking people if they had any thoughts about the trees. No one I interviewed registered strong opinions, or had even heard of the controversy.<br><br> One resident of 450 Condon Terrace immediately redirected my attention to a massive hole in the ground of her parking lot, which she said had been caused by a garbage truck. Another told me he hadn&#39;t heard about the controversy but wanted to talk about trash pickup. “I mean, look at this shit,” he said, pointing to a pile of trash on the sidewalk. Trees? Low on the list of priorities. Another man found my line of questioning confusing, to say the least. “They&#39;re oxygen!” When I said some people worried the trees could encourage crime, he laughed at me. “Now, you know that&#39;s crazy. Who&#39;s going to hide underneath these trees?”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/10/big-little-ideas-start-planting-trees/622142/">James Fallows: Start planting trees</a><br><br> So who forms “the community” so opposed to the trees? His name is Darryl Ross.<br><br> Ross has been active in local politics for decades. He is treasurer of the Ward 8 Democrats and of White&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/just-a-quarter-of-dc-constituent-service-funds-provided-assistance-report-finds/2019/03/26/191d0f80-4fc8-11e9-88a1-ed346f0ec94f_story.html">constituent-services fund</a> , a controversial purse that some critics have called a “slush fund.” When White refers to constituent outreach to his office over this issue, he&#39;s talking about Ross. (White and his chief of staff both declined to be interviewed for this story.) Ross doesn&#39;t live at 450 Xenia Street, but he used to. He still owns a unit in the building, which he rents out, and is the president of the Xenia Condominium Owners Association.<br><br> Ross has been angry about the trees since the day they were planted. He told me he saw workers digging and began calling around, furious that no one had informed the neighborhood about the project, astounded that the city thought 35 trees (“a forest!”) made sense on the street, and frustrated by hypothetical future private costs that the trees would impose on residents.<br><br> His 311 requests to remove the trees went nowhere. So he tried officials at DDOT and the Urban Forestry Department, White and several other members of the city council, the office of the inspector general, and current and former members of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission. He knows he wouldn&#39;t have been able to get so much attention without his connections: “Believe me, I&#39;m using all the leverage I can to get the desired result,” he told me.<br><br> After months of effort, in August of 2021, representatives from DDOT, White&#39;s chief of staff, and a senior staffer for at-large Council Member Anita Bonds met with Ross and a couple of area residents on the site to discuss the problem. The officials agreed to remove 14 of the 35 newly planted trees. The agency also promised to complete a lighting survey, which resulted in the installation of three large streetlights, a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://urbanlabs.uchicago.edu/projects/crime-lights-study">data-driven approach to reducing crime</a> .<br><br> The “desire to compromise for this individual is because we want to make sure we&#39;re doing this <em>for</em> people, not <em>to</em> them,” a senior official in the Urban Forestry department (who requested anonymity to speak freely) told me. “If we can mollify someone, engender a sense of ownership … You take someone and make them more of an ally.”<br><br> Ross was not mollified. He continued his crusade to have three more trees removed—the ones closest to his condo building&#39;s walkway. He lodged a complaint with DC&#39;s Office of the Inspector General, which led to a formal response from DDOT Director Everett Lott, who argued that the department had broken no laws in planting the trees and had in fact exceeded the mandate for public notification. Undeterred, Ross continued his advocacy, which culminated with White&#39;s proposed emergency resolution at the city-council meeting in June.<br><br> Ross put me in touch with a few of his allies, most of whom sounded only slightly more informed about the situation than the residents I randomly encountered on my visits. Some had no idea that many trees had already been removed; others were just vaguely aware that at one point the trees had seemed like a problem. One woman told me she thought children might throw fallen apples at cars or building windows. (The trees at issue in the emergency legislation are linden, not apple.)<br><br> According to Ross, the condo association was united in opposition. He called the vice president, Hazel Farmer, on speaker in my presence.<br><br> “You remember there were four [trees] that were too close to the walkway?” he asked.<br><br> “I thought we had finished that,” she said, sounding confused.<br><br> “No, no, we are still battling,” Ross replied quickly.<br><br> After Ross refreshed her memory, Farmer said she worried that the trees would one day push up the concrete sidewalk, impeding residents&#39; ability to walk in and out of the building. Ross later clarified that Farmer had already moved out because the steps on the walkway were too difficult for her to navigate.<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">na July legislative meeting,</span> White withdrew the emergency resolution, citing a compromise reached by the chair of the DC council and DDOT to apply a growth regulator to the offending saplings. This outcome infuriates Ross, who is seeking a meeting with Mayor Muriel Bowser: “At the end of the day we voted for her, we didn&#39;t vote for [DDOT officials], and we had faith in her to do what&#39;s best for the people.”<br><br> Ross still has options. If the worst happens and these trees end up extending over the sidewalk, he can call 311 to request tree pruning. According to the Urban Forestry Department, these requests are resolved, on average, within 20 days.<br><br> But the more I talked with Ross and his allies, the more I realized that the trees were also stand-ins for their broader unhappiness with DDOT, which they see as not acting <em>for</em> them but doing things <em>to</em> them: bike racks “just dropped” in front of some businesses, bike lanes constructed over their objections, and traffic-safety infrastructure— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/dashboards/a2f1cca5159e4c6eae197895d2e08336">in DC&#39;s highest traffic-fatality ward</a> —installed without their consent. This is why Ross was able to enlist supporters in the first place—by tapping into existing anger some residents feel toward the city&#39;s transportation agency. Anger that, in a ward of nearly 90,000 people, a few individuals do not have the final say.<br><br> This is a classic story of local government and its discontents. Government takes action. Angry, well-connected local fights back, annoyed that they weren&#39;t consulted. But when they fight back, claiming the will of the “people,” how do we know if they&#39;re right? Backing up a bit: How do we even decide who the people <em>are</em> ?<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/07/local-government-power-nimby-denver/674164/">From the July/August 2023 issue: Colorado&#39;s ingenious idea for solving the housing crisis</a><br><br> In the Xenia Street episode, is it the people who live right next to the trees? How about one street over? Just property owners like Ross? Because the trees are on public land, should all DC residents have a say? Is it all Americans? Addressing the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.usda.gov/media/press-releases/2022/07/25/biden-harris-administration-announces-plans-reforestation-climate#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20July%2025%2C%202022%20%E2%80%94,trees%20over%20the%20next%20decade.">reforestation backlog is a national priority</a> . Or, given that trees help mitigate climate change, should <em>all</em> people have a voice? This is the so-called boundary problem, which the political scientist Robert Dahl once quipped has “no theoretical solution,” only pragmatic ones. Even if surveying all of humanity were theoretically desirable, it&#39;s a practical impossibility. One has to draw the line somewhere and delegate representatives or spokespersons.<br><br> Arguably the best delegates in this matter are local elected officials, who get their authority from voters. The problem is that, at the local and especially hyperlocal levels, nobody&#39;s voting. In 2018, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/08/17/two-thirds-of-d-c-neighborhood-races-uncontested/">two-thirds of Advisory Neighborhood Commission races were uncontested</a> . Even when these contests are competitive, only a handful of people show up to cast a ballot. In the single-member district that includes Xenia Street, Armstead, one of Ross&#39;s allies, lost her election <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://electionresults.dcboe.org/election_results/2022-General-Election">137–91</a> . Last year, two ANC races were <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dcist.com/story/22/12/01/two-dc-races-to-be-decided-by-casting-of-lots/">tied following Election Day</a> ; in one of them each candidate had garnered 12 votes apiece, while in the other each candidate had claimed just one (presumably their own). Vox populi indeed.<br><br> If the ANC can&#39;t quite speak for the people, what about the DC council, and specifically Council Member White? Council voting rates are also dismal: About 8,700 people total voted in the 2020 primary contest that secured White&#39;s reelection, out of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://data.census.gov/table?q=B29001:+CITIZEN,+VOTING-AGE+POPULATION+BY+AGE&amp;g=040XX00US11%246100000_1400000US11001000101&amp;tid=ACSDT5Y2021.B29001">roughly 57,000 citizens of voting age in Ward 8</a> .<br><br> How about DDOT? As an agency housed in the executive branch, DDOT gains its authority from the mayor. In 2022, Mayor Bowser received fewer than 4,000 votes from Ward 8 during the primary (the true election in this heavily Democratic city). Only about 10,000 people in the ward voted at all in that contest.<br><br> There&#39;s no magical threshold at which elected officials become democratically legitimate. But more than half of eligible voters <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2023/2022-voting-registration.html#:~:text=Turnout%20rates%20for%20the%20citizen,%25)%20citizen%20voting%2Dage%20population.">routinely show up</a> for federal and state contests while our municipal elections <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://www.whovotesformayor.org/">struggle to top 15 percent</a> . What we&#39;re seeing in local governments is a crisis of democracy unparalleled at other levels of government.<br><br> “I <span class="smallcaps">t&#39;s not the trees;</span> it&#39;s the disrespect,” Armstead told me. She called tree removal a top priority because “when you come to a community and you don&#39;t listen, then [we&#39;re] being disrespected and disregarded.” Ross made a similar point: “It makes me angry because, like I said, we&#39;re the stakeholders. We&#39;re the taxpayers. We fund the salaries for the DC government employees, council … This is our money!”<br><br> When we collectively feel entitled to hold the government accountable, that&#39;s democracy. But when individuals do, that&#39;s something else: institutional capture.<br><br> Because so few people vote in local elections, the power of those who speak up and claim to speak for their neighborhoods is hard to challenge. If a homeowner&#39;s association headed by the neighborhood busybody says he speaks for you, are you showing up to contest that claim? What&#39;s obvious about Ross&#39;s perseverance is that its effectiveness is largely due to its singularity. If <em>everyone</em> engaged as he did—called and emailed and attended meeting after meeting, filed complaints with everyone from the office of the inspector general on down—his power would dilute instantly. No one can claim to speak for a community if everyone&#39;s speaking for themselves.<br><br> Democracy is about feedback loops. We elect people. If they do poorly, we choose alternatives. But when the election system falters from disuse, other feedback loops take root. Elected officials at the local level become accountable to the unrepresentative handful of voters who do engage; and public servants become preemptively sensitive to well-connected people who have the time and energy to demand disproportionate focus.<br><br> People like Ross may not get everything they want, but they know how to command attention. No fewer than four DC council members have become personally involved in the matter of the trees on Xenia Street. Meanwhile, that massive hole in the ground? It&#39;s still there.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 08 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trees-xenia-street-washington-dc-local-government/674949/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trees-xenia-street-washington-dc-local-government/674949/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Mike Pence’s 11th Commandment]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>你可以说特朗普的坏话，但要小心。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/cTTxI1FB31U4Xhlmi-d3uh0WYyc=/0x0:5693x3202/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/GettyImages_1552040644/original.jpg" alt="迈克·彭斯在舞台上" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>安娜摇钱树/盖蒂</figcaption></figure><small><i>这是</i>《大西洋<i>日报》的一个版本，是一份时事通讯，可引导您了解当天最大的故事，帮助您发现新想法，并推荐最好的文化。</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/atlantic-daily/"><i>在这里注册。</i></a></small><br><br>罗纳德·里根的第十一条诫命是：“不得说任何共和党同胞的坏话。”这个周末，迈克·彭斯——像大多数共和党人一样——极力批评唐纳德·特朗普，但几乎没有提及特朗普的名字。<br><br>首先，这是来自<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>的三个新故事：<br><br><li> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/black-folk-book-working-class-blair-lm-kelley/674935/">Ibram X.

2021 年 1 月 6 日履行了宪法义务，从而避免了美国政府的崩溃和可能随之而来的流血事件，而且最近他似乎正在大力批评他担任副总统的人。然而，和许多其他共和党领袖一样，彭斯似乎受到了一种死灵法师的诅咒，当他试图说出唐纳德·特朗普的名字时，他冒着被打哑的风险。<br><br>昨天，哥伦比亚广播公司记者加勒特少校<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mike-pence-face-the-nation-aug-6-2023-transcript/">询问彭斯</a>是否仍会投票给特朗普。这是一个将垒球击出公园的机会。相反，他连击了。<br><br><p><b>加勒特少校：</b>你会再次投票给唐纳德·特朗普吗？</p><p><b>迈克·彭斯：</b>听着，我认为我不必这么做。我必须告诉你，无论我走到哪里——</p><p><b>加勒特：</b>副总统先生，这不是问题所在。你会再次投票给唐纳德·特朗普吗？</p><p><b>彭斯：</b>是的。是的，我知道你的问题是什么，但让我说得非常清楚：我竞选总统是因为我认为任何把自己置于宪法之上的人都不应该成为总统，也不应该再次成为总统。</p>嗯，这是一种方法。另一种说法是，“从个人经验来看，唐纳德·特朗普是椭圆形办公室里最危险的人，我将尽一切努力阻止他。”值得称赞的是，彭斯在 1 月 6 日开始采访时，用了足够长的时间使用特朗普的名字，并表示他“错了”。彭斯说，特朗普“那天要求我把他置于宪法之上，但我选择了宪法，而且我永远都会选择。”当被问及是否会作证反对特朗普时，彭斯再次呜咽道：“我没有计划作证，但人们可以相信我们会遵守法律。如果法律的召唤到来，我们将做出回应，而且我们只会说出真相。”<br><br>这并不是令人惊叹的反抗。我们也不应该对一位美国政客声称他将履行他过去多次宣誓的宪法誓言过分印象深刻。但在这个奇怪的时代，我们会采取我们能得到的东西。尽管如此，彭斯显然对这个问题感到不舒服，并尽一切努力将特朗普的名字排除在讨论之外，当你领导一场针对自己前竞选搭档的竞选活动时，这是一件奇怪的事情。<br><br>同样，考虑一下罗恩·德桑蒂斯 (Ron DeSantis) 勉强接受特朗普输掉 2020 年大选的事实。 “他当然输了，”德桑蒂斯今天在接受 NBC 新闻<a data-event-element="inline link"

</i>选民会蜂拥而至，比如妮基·哈利 (Nikki Haley) 或维韦克·拉马斯瓦米 (Vivek Ramaswamy)。这就是《<i>堡垒》</i>作家蒂姆·米勒所说<a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-indicted-january-6-jack-smith/674886/">上周起诉前总统以来，这位前总统的公开行为表明他</a>感到被逼入绝境。这并不是说特朗普<em>被逼</em>入绝境——他摆脱困境的能力让<a data-event-element="inline

Chutkan)。他在阿拉巴马州和南卡罗来纳州发表了愤怒的演讲。他嘲笑美国女足国家队，指责乔·拜登总统提前退出世界杯， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/110842705795010789">莫名其妙地嘲笑</a>前众议院议长南希·佩洛西（“她是一个邪恶的女巫，她丈夫的地狱之旅从她开始，到她结束。她是一个生病和精神错乱的精神病人，有一天会生活在地狱里！”）。他派他的律师去制作所有五个主要的周日早间电视节目。 <a

“精神错乱的杰克·史密斯正在他的头号选秀权、他的‘梦想’的法官（他必须被撤职！）面前，试图剥夺我的第一修正案权利——尽管事实上他，司法部，和他的许多暴徒检察官，正在非法向假新闻媒体泄露一切！” <a data-event-element="inline link"

Chutkan（“当法官“分配”到可笑的言论自由/公平选举案件时，我不可能得到公平的审判”）。<br><br>通常不建议将攻击案件中的法官和检察官作为辩护策略，但特朗普对礼貌、礼貌或基本常识没有什么用处。史密斯显然正在注意；检察官在法庭文件中引用了社交媒体上一条含糊威胁的帖子，该帖子发布几小时后。 （消息称：“如果你追我，我就追你！”；特朗普发言人声称，这实际上是针对“绿诺集团、热爱中国、不诚实的特殊利益集团和超级政治行动委员会”。）特朗普对查特坎的猛烈抨击，查特坎是一位黑人奥巴马任命的人，他甚至还没有机会在此案中做出任何重大决定，而他对艾琳·坎农法官缺乏批评，艾琳·坎农是特朗普任命的法官，负责监督佛罗里达州的案件，因为他对机密处理不当。文件，如果不令人惊讶的话，也是值得注意的。<br><br>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/profit"><em>《南方公园》</em>中的内裤侏儒模因</a>：第一步和期望的结果很清楚，但中间的步骤可能是什么却完全神秘。尽管特朗普称史密斯“精神错乱”，但这位特别检察官却显得异常、甚至不可思议地冷漠。与其他特区法官一样，Chutkan 驳回了之前关于 1 月 6 日审判无法在该地区公平进行的说法。<br><br>另一种理论认为，特朗普只是在迎合公众舆论，而不是法院。昨天，特朗普的律师约翰·劳罗(John Lauro)在周日节目中巡回演出，这一策略被环城公路的书呆子们称为“完整的金斯伯格”(Full Ginsburg)，以莫妮卡·莱温斯基(Monica Lewinsky)的律师威廉·金斯伯格(William Ginsburg)的名字命名，后者率先回应有关他的客户与时任总统比尔关系的报道。克林顿.这是一种强大的公共关系工具——例如<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Ginsburg">总统候选人使用的工具</a>——但作为审前策略却有些令人困惑。<br><br>特朗普通常更感兴趣的是唤醒他的支持者，而不是寻求谨慎的辩护，显然他认为，无论他在法律方面存在什么问题，他的政治影响力都足以逃避或至少巧妙地应对危险。在针对他的两起联邦案件中，他可能最终面临不那么容易规避的指控，但他的反应不一定跟上。<br><br>

link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-indictment-jan-6-opinion-poll-2023-08-06/">哥伦比亚广播公司新闻/YouGov 的一项新民意调查</a>，超过一半的美国人认为对特朗普的指控旨在损害他的 2024 年竞选活动，尽管绝大多数人也认为这些指控是为了维护法治和捍卫民主。但劳罗在电视上提出的实际论点似乎并不是特别精心设计，而且似乎反而强化了这样一个现实：无论公众是否希望他被定罪，他们都对特朗普试图窃取选举结果感到震惊。<br><br>劳罗在不同场合辩称，特朗普所谓的行为是“有抱负的”。例如，“特朗普总统没有做的是指示副总统彭斯做任何事情，”劳罗在美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 上说道。 “他以一种渴望的方式问他。”他还称特朗普要求佐治亚州国务卿布拉德·拉芬斯佩格“找到 11,780 票”是一个“雄心勃勃的要求”。这种毫无区别的区分给律法主义带来了坏名声。劳罗还表示，即使特朗普“技术上违反了宪法”，他也没有犯罪。 But telling the public that your client violated the Constitution seems like a questionable PR decision.<br><br> Neither Lauro, in his five appearances, nor Trump, going back to his initial response to the indictment, has actually rebutted the charges. Trump has claimed that the government is attacking his right to free speech, but he has made nearly no effort to question the specifics of the charges. A rare example is his denial of Pence&#39;s claim that Trump said he was “too honest.” More broadly, Trump hasn&#39;t offered any bigger explanation for his weeks-long push to subvert the election. If Trump is acting as though he&#39;s cornered, that is because he doesn&#39;t have a good answer to this question.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 19:37:08 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Seven Books That Will Make You Put Down Your Phone]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> These titles self-consciously aim to grab their reader&#39;s attention. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/caY-Vi1xSW7IkSFO8j6GwbHQ9rA=/0x0:3500x1969/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/Atlantic_1/original.jpg" alt="A book with a ton of eyeballs attached to the cover, all looking different ways" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Matt Chase</figcaption></figure> When I teach a literature class to undergraduates, one of my most important tasks is to help my students relearn how to read in the age of distraction. I assign them an exercise: Set a timer for 20 minutes and dive into a book, no phone in sight, and don&#39;t stop before the alarm goes off. They frequently tell me that time moves differently when they do this. The first few minutes drag, and the exercise feels totally impossible and dull, but as they keep sitting and reading, they begin to focus on the world inside the pages in front of them. By the end, they&#39;re usually surprised by the timer ringing, and hungry to keep reading.<br><br> My students aren&#39;t the only ones who benefit from this exercise, and the activity works with any book. But this list will offer you a head start. The seven titles below self-consciously aim to grab their reader&#39;s attention, whether through form or content. Each will pull you into reading in a different way: Some are brief and succinct; others are long and sprawling. Some use the second person to directly address the reader; others dive deeply into one subject and invite you along. But what they all have in common is their ability to refresh your powers of observation and make you see the real world in a new manner by the end.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/mrs-caliban-rachel-ingalls/9780811226691?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Mrs. Caliban</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Rachel Ingalls</strong><br><br> The first book I recommend to anyone in a reading slump is <em>Mrs. Caliban</em> , a novella that&#39;s less than 150 pages, with a fascinating plot and quick pacing. Written in 1982 but reissued in 2017, <em>Mrs. Caliban</em> follows Dorothy, a lonely 1950s-style housewife, who meets Larry, an amphibious sea creature who looks almost exactly like a man, just with green skin and webbed hands and feet. Larry finds refuge from his scientist captors in Dorothy&#39;s house, and the two have an oddly romantic affair right under her husband, Fred&#39;s, nose. Dorothy and Fred are “too unhappy to get a divorce,” so Larry is actually a welcome guest who offers Dorothy not only exotic tales about an underwater world, but also a listening ear for her struggles as a housewife. People (including my students) have speculated that Guillermo del Toro&#39;s film <em>The Shape of Water</em> is loosely based on <em>Mrs. Caliban</em> , which makes sense—Ingalls&#39;s writing is hypnotic and cinematic, and <em>Mrs. Caliban</em> is the kind of book you can read in one sitting: It captures your attention like a blockbuster.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1986/04/discovery-of-the-month/667376/">Read: Discovery of the month (from 1986)</a><br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-fifth-season-n-k-jemisin/9780316229296?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>The Fifth Season</em></strong></a> <strong>, by NK Jemisin</strong><br><br> The end of <em>The Fifth Season</em> has my favorite section of any speculative-fiction or fantasy novel: a huge glossary of terms such as <em>stone eaters</em> , <em>commless</em> , and <em>orogene</em> that appears after the plot stops, giving the reader a hand in interpreting the wildly unconventional world of the book. And it&#39;s helpful here, because the complex, intricate story takes place on a supercontinent called the Stillness that is on the verge of its regular apocalypse, known as the “fifth season,” a period of catastrophic climate change. “Orogenes,” who can use thermal energy to create seismic events, are considered dangerous people, and most are in hiding, shunned from society. Jemisin&#39;s main character, Essun, is one of them, hiding her true identity as she works as a teacher in her village. She returns home one day to find that her husband has murdered her son and kidnapped her daughter—both of whom inherited her powers. She must journey to save her daughter, accompanied by a mysterious child, while the world around her crumbles. After reading a few chapters of <em>The Fifth Season</em> , you&#39;ll be immersed in this new world and its intricacies, enraptured by the ways this society&#39;s structures shed light on the worst realities of our own.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/if-on-a-winter-s-night-a-traveler-italo-calvino/9780156439619?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>If on a Winter&#39;s Night a Traveler</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Italo Calvino</strong><br><br> A story that has an experimental or mysterious structure turns you into a detective, trying to figure out not just what happened, but also why the writing is the way it is. To me, the most delightful work in this vein is <em>If on a Winter&#39;s Night a Traveler</em> , by Italo Calvino, a book about someone called the Reader and addressed as “you,” who is constantly undercut in his attempt to read a novel called <em>If on a Winter&#39;s Night a Traveler</em> , by Italo Calvino. Right away, the Reader finds that his copy has been misprinted, bound with another novel, which he then buys—but he only gets so far into his second choice before that one is interrupted too. Each novel he picks up is somehow confiscated, unfinished, missing, or full of mistakes. But as the Reader picks up story after story, never able to finish, he meets his female counterpart, Ludmilla, who is trying to read the same titles. The loops of their impossible journey are postmodern, but the tone isn&#39;t abstract or cerebral—it&#39;s funny and sweet. The metafiction of Calvino&#39;s novel, literally addressed to “you,” dramatizes the difficulty of paying attention and finding just the right book. Ironically, it&#39;s totally easy to read, as the Reader&#39;s choices flip from romance to thriller to realist novel, all interwoven with one man&#39;s journey to find his love.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/her-body-and-other-parties-stories-carmen-maria-machado/9781555977887?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Her Body and Other Parties</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Carmen Maria Machado</strong><br><br> Short-story collections can deploy a variety of tones and styles that most novels can&#39;t—each story can be totally unique. <em>Her Body and Other Parties</em> has such an unbelievable range, trafficking in the funny, the bizarre, the unreal, and the haunting, that any reader could find something arresting in it. Machado reimagines the tale of the girl with the green ribbon around her neck right alongside a novella, “Especially Heinous,” in which the characters of <em>Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</em> contend with ghosts and doppelgängers. Even when she&#39;s riffing on episodes of TV that the audience is familiar with, Machado makes the known world look stranger; as a result, supernatural occurrences begin to seem more and more logical. In another story, “Inventory,” a woman lists all of her sexual experiences while the world is slowly consumed by a pandemic. Her nostalgia for the way things used to be morphs into horror at what the world has become—and her lists, on the surface recalling the past but really narrating the present, become a way to cope with the uncertainty each day brings. Likewise, each story in <em>Her Body and Other Parties</em> does many things at once, every genre bent and every first impression unreliable, always fresh and also frightening.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/gathering-moss-a-natural-and-cultural-history-of-mosses-robin-wall-kimmerer/9780870714993?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Gathering Moss</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Robin Wall Kimmerer</strong><br><br> Paying attention is not the topic but the mode of Kimmerer&#39;s first book, <em>Gathering Moss</em> . Whereas her 2013 collection, <em>Braiding Sweetgrass</em> , delves into the many overlaps between Indigenous and scientific knowledge systems, here Kimmerer is deeply focused on just one organism: moss. Over a series of short personal essays, she peers at the tiny world of moss and what it can teach us. Moss can give us metaphors for our life, help us understand our relationships, and show us the way tiny things order the larger world, she argues. Relying on her background as a scientist and an Indigenous scholar, she shows us how rich, how deserving of respect, and how shockingly beautiful the minuscule world really is. Kimmerer writes about looking up from her microscope after examining moss and being “taken aback at the plainness of the ordinary world, the drab and predictable shapes.” Kimmerer&#39;s personal style instills variety: Each essay provides new information not only about the organisms she&#39;s observing, but also about her many roles within houses, laboratories, and communities. By the end, she has inspired readers to see just as she does, with intimate focus on the smallest parts of life.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/black-writers-environmental-literature-exclusion/672835/">Read: Housekeeping is part of the wild world too</a><br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-rabbit-hutch-tess-gunty/9780593534663?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>The Rabbit Hutch</em></strong></a> <strong>, by Tess Gunty</strong><br><br> Reading a book that really paints a picture of its location feels a bit like traveling from home—you can get to know everything about a place&#39;s history, people, and minutiae. Gunty&#39;s debut novel, <em>The Rabbit Hutch</em> , delivers on this front. A multivoiced story, it follows the many residents of La Lapinière, a low-income apartment complex in Vacca Vale, Indiana, called the Rabbit Hutch by locals. The novel begins when Blandine Watkins, a teenage resident of Apartment C4, is attacked. She thinks of this violence as an “exit” from her body, a phrase that echoes her obsession with the medieval mystic Hildegard von Bingen. From here, the novel works backwards to show what led to that moment, following different occupants of the Rabbit Hutch over one hot week in July: An online-obituary comment moderator irks a celebrity&#39;s son to the point of danger, a mother finally tells her husband she&#39;s afraid of her baby&#39;s eyes, and the three young men Blandine lives with become obsessed with her. It&#39;s a brilliant meditation on how much we don&#39;t know about our nearest neighbors, and how the places we live can bring us together—or tear us apart.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/08/book-recommendations-narrative-tools-setting/671216/">Read: Seven books where the setting exposes the characters</a><br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/possession-a-s-byatt/9780679735908?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>Possession</em></strong></a> <strong>, by AS Byatt</strong><br><br> It may feel counterintuitive, but when nothing else can keep my attention, I know it&#39;s time to go long. As opposed to the articles, tweets, and TikToks I see all day, I find that a long novel with a drawn-out structure and pacing—especially a deep dive into several psyches, over some period of time—will always keep me engaged. Plenty of classic novels offer this, but my favorite is Byatt&#39;s <em>Possession</em> , a 1990 novel that adopts aVictorian structure and gives it a postmodern bent. There are two timelines—a contemporary narrative, in which the scholars Roland Michell and Maud Bailey discover letters between two Victorian poets and reconstruct a missing piece of literary history, and a Victorian narrative, in which we see the relationship between those same poets, Randolph Henry Ash and Christabel LaMotte. Woven into these two plots are poems, letters, and excerpts from scholarly books—all masterfully written by Byatt. The two worlds create intense dramatic irony: The reader gets to see both what Michell and Bailey get right and what their archives can never capture, reminding us how unknown the territory of the past truly is. The slow pacing means we get to delve into each perspective, but the book remains thrilling throughout, as a picture of history comes slowly into view. By the end, I find I&#39;m always itching to start reading it again.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 14:21:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/attention-focus-book-recommendations/674941/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2023/08/attention-focus-book-recommendations/674941/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Three Attacks on Intellectual Freedom]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> PEN struggles to reconcile its commitment to social justice with its commitment to free speech. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/RvB3J9O-G-0EMxFw0lNublu9a84=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/PENProtection/original.png" alt="A statue with a quote bubble for a shield" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Paul Spella / The Atlantic; Source: Getty.</figcaption></figure> <small><em>Updated at 9:21 pm ET on August 7, 2023</em></small><br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n June 1953</span> , at the height of the McCarthy era, while congressional investigators and private groups were hunting down “subversive” or merely “objectionable” books and authors in the name of national security, the American Library Association and the Association Book Publishers Council issued a manifesto called “The Freedom to Read.” The document defended free expression and denounced censorship and conformity in language whose clarity and force are startling today. It argued for “the widest diversity of views and expressions” and against purging work based on “the personal history or political affiliations of the author.” It urged publishers and librarians to resist government and private suppression, and to “give full meaning to the freedom to read by providing books that enrich the quality and diversity of thought.” The manifesto took on not just official censorship, but the broader atmosphere of coercion and groupthink. It concluded: “We do not state these propositions in the comfortable belief that what people read is unimportant. We believe rather that what people read is deeply important; that ideas can be dangerous; but that the suppression of ideas is fatal to a democratic society. Freedom itself is a dangerous way of life, but it is ours.”<br><br> “The Freedom to Read” was covered in papers and on TV news. President Dwight Eisenhower, who that same month had urged the graduating class of Dartmouth College not to “join the book burners,”&#39; sent a letter of praise to the manifesto&#39;s authors. In one of the darkest periods of American history, the manifesto gave librarians and publishers the courage of their principles. One librarian later wrote, “There developed a fighting profession, made up of dedicated people who were sure of their direction.”<br><br> This past June, the library and publishers&#39; associations <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.slj.com/story/Freedom-to-Read-Statement-Reissued-on-Its-70th-Anniversary#:~:text=On%20the%2070th%20anniversary%20of,statement%20and%20reaffirmed%20its%20message.">reissued</a> “The Freedom to Read” on its 70th anniversary. Scores of publishers, libraries, literary groups, civil-liberty organizations, and authors signed on to endorse its principles. And yet many of those institutional signatories—including the “Big Five” publishing conglomerates—often violate its propositions, perhaps not even aware that they&#39;re doing so. Few of them, if any, could produce as unapologetic a defense of intellectual freedom as the one made at a time when inquisitors were destroying careers and lives. It&#39;s worth asking why the American literary world in 2023 is less able to uphold the principles of “The Freedom to Read” than its authors in 1953.<br><br> The attack on intellectual freedom today is coming from several directions. First—and likely the main concern of the signatories—is an official campaign by governors, state legislatures, local governments, and school boards to weed out books and ideas they don&#39;t like. Most of the targets are politically on the left; most present facts or express views about race, gender, and sexuality that the censors consider dangerous, divisive, obscene, or simply wrong. The effort began in Texas as early as 2020, before public hysteria and political opportunism spread the campaign to Florida and other states, and to every level of education, removing from library shelves and class reading lists several thousand books by writers such as Toni Morrison and Malala Yousafzai.<br><br> Given that states and school districts have a responsibility to set public-school curricula, not all of this can be called government censorship. But laws and policies to prevent students from encountering controversial, unpopular, even offensive writers and ideas amount to a powerfully repressive campaign of book banning, some of it probably unconstitutional. The campaign stems from an American tradition of small-minded panic at rapid change and unorthodox thinking. You can draw a line from Tennessee&#39;s 1925 <em>Scopes</em> trial to Florida&#39;s 2022 Stop WOKE Act. This threat to intellectual freedom is the easiest one for the progressive and enlightened people who predominate in the book world to oppose. No one at Penguin Random House or the National Book Foundation hesitates to stand up for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/books/maia-kobabe-gender-queer-book-ban.html"><em>Gender Queer</em></a> and <em>The Handmaid&#39;s Tale</em> .<br><br> “T <span class="smallcaps">here is more</span> than one way to burn a book,” Ray Bradbury once said. “And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.” The second threat to intellectual freedom comes from a different source—from inside the house. This threat is the subject of a new report that PEN America has just published, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pen.org/report/booklash">Booklash: Literary Freedom, Online Outrage, and the Language of Harm</a> .” (Because I have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/equity-language-guides-sierra-club-banned-words/673085/">written about censorship and language</a> in the past, PEN asked me to read and respond to an earlier draft and gave me an advance copy of the final version.) The report is focused on the recent pattern of publishers and authors canceling their own books, sometimes after publication, under pressure organized online or by members, often younger ones, of their own staffs. PEN has tracked 31 cases of what might be called literary infanticide since 2016; half occurred in just the past two years. “None of these books were withdrawn based on any allegation of factual disinformation, nor glorification of violence, nor plagiarism,” the report notes. “Their content or author was simply deemed offensive.”<br><br> A few cases became big news. Hachette canceled Woody Allen&#39;s autobiography after a staff walkout, and Blake Bailey&#39;s biography of Philip Roth was withdrawn after publication by Norton, both following accusations of sexual misconduct by the authors (Allen and Bailey denied the accusations). Publishers have canceled books following an author&#39;s public remarks—for example, those of the cartoonist Scott Adams, the British journalist Julie Burchill, and the right-wing provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos.<br><br> In one particularly wild case, an author named Natasha Tynes, on the verge of publishing her first novel, a crime thriller, saw a Black employee of the Washington, DC, Metro system eating on a train (a violation of the system&#39;s rules). She tweeted a picture of the woman at the transit authority with a complaint, and immediately found herself transformed into a viral racist. Within hours her distributor, Rare Bird Books, had dropped the novel, tweeting that Tynes “did something truly horrible today.” The publisher, California Coldblood, after trying to wash its hands of the book, eventually went ahead with publication “due to contractual obligations,” but the novel was as good as dead. “How can you expect authors to be these perfect creatures who never commit any faults?” Tynes lamented to PEN. Most publishers now include a boilerplate morals clause in book contracts that legitimizes these cancellations—a loophole that contradicts tenets of “The Freedom to Read” that those publishers endorsed.<br><br> Many of the cases discussed in the report have nothing to do with an author&#39;s offensive statements or bad behavior. Instead, they involve sins of phrasing, characterization, plot, subject matter, or authorial identity. Last year Picador dropped a schoolteacher&#39;s prizewinning memoir when it was attacked for racially insensitive portrayals. A scholarly study of Black feminist culture was withdrawn by Wipf and Stock after critics pointed out that its author was white. Simon &amp; Schuster preemptively killed a biography for children of Hitler because of Hitler. Four young-adult and children&#39;s novels (which seem particularly vulnerable to attack) were pulled for supposedly offensive stories and descriptions. One of them, <em>A Place for Wolves</em> —a novel about two gay American boys set in Kosovo during its war with Serbia—was canceled by its author, Kosoko Jackson, himself a prosecutor of literary offenses via Twitter, after people on social media accused him of violating his own edict about identity placing strict limits on appropriate subject matter: “Stories about the civil rights movement should be written by black people,” he&#39;d tweeted. “Stories of suffrage should be written by women. Ergo, stories about boys during horrific and life changing times, like the AIDS EPIDEMIC, should be written by gay men. Why is this so hard to get?”<br><br> At the heart of these literary autos-da-fé is identity—or, in a phrase the report uses several times, “marginalized identities.” The trip wires that can blow up a writer&#39;s work—charges of “harmful” language, failures of “representation,” “appropriation,” or generally “problematic” content—are all strung along lines of identity. When Jeanine Cummins, a white writer, received a lot attention (and, reportedly, a seven-figure book deal) in 2020 for <em>American Dirt</em> , a novel about a Mexican mother and child on the run from a drug gang, she was denounced for taking an opportunity that should have gone to a Latina author who would, some critics said, have written a better book. Her publisher, Flatiron/Macmillan, didn&#39;t pull the novel—it was selling far too many copies—but it canceled Cummins&#39;s tour, citing safety concerns, and issued an abject statement of self-criticism. The ordeal of <em>American Dirt</em> showed publishers that crossing lines of identity can be dangerous, prompting one former editor, interviewed anonymously by PEN, to ask: “Are we saying that not anyone can write any story? Do you have to have a certain identity? There&#39;s a lot of fear around that.”<br><br> A skeptic might ask why a few dozen awkward decisions and minor controversies out of tens of thousands of books published every year should matter. The answer is that these incidents reveal an atmosphere of conformity and fear that undermines any claim book publishing has to being more than just a business. Most of the canceled books described in the report are victims of a pervasive orthodoxy. At its most rigid, this orthodoxy puts the claims of identity above everything else—literary quality, authorial independence, the freedom to read. Its reach can be seen in how many of the canceled books were already making obvious, if clumsy, efforts to abide by the values of equity and inclusion; and in Natasha Tynes&#39;s attempt to defend herself from online attacks by pleading that she herself is “a minority writer.”<br><br> Eventually, orthodoxy makes the suppression of books unnecessary because it leads to self-censorship by editors and writers. One canceled author interviewed by PEN said, “It has shut me down, creatively. There is always a censor, perched on my shoulder, telling me I cannot write about this or that topic.” What writer can honestly say it isn&#39;t true of them? Almost none of the editors interviewed for the PEN report were willing to be quoted by name. What are they afraid of, if not the fate of their authors?<br><br> Below the waterline lie all the books that aren&#39;t contracted, or even written, because of the examples that become public. In an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-my-new-novel-about-racial-conflict-ran-into-trouble-53a53f54">op-ed for</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-my-new-novel-about-racial-conflict-ran-into-trouble-53a53f54"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> , the best-selling author Richard North Patterson wrote that his latest novel—about an interracial relationship set against battles over voting rights and white racism—was rejected by “roughly 20” New York publishers. “The seemingly dominant sentiment was that only those personally subject to discrimination could be safely allowed to depict it through fictional characters,” Patterson wrote. ( <em>Trial</em> was published in June by a conservative Christian firm in Tennessee and currently ranks around No. 37,000 among all books on Amazon. Several books in the PEN report, canceled by major publishers, were grabbed up by small houses with far less reach.)<br><br> PEN is a free-speech organization. Having already issued a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">lengthy report</a> and numerous statements condemning book banning by state and local governments, it seems to have realized that it could not ignore a pattern of suppression closer to home, by organizations that publish PEN members and sponsor its fundraising galas.<br><br> In May, PEN landed in the middle of its own free-speech controversy when two Ukrainian soldier-writers announced that they would withdraw from the organization&#39;s World Voices Festival if two Russian writers were also included on another panel. Rather than cancel the Ukrainians, who had already arrived in the United States, and send them back home to the war, PEN asked the Russian writers and their panel&#39;s moderator, Masha Gessen, a PEN board member, to speak under a different banner, that of PEN America. The Russians and Gessen instead decided to cancel their own event, and Gessen resigned from the board in protest for what was seen as PEN caving in to the Ukrainians&#39; demands. (One of the Russian writers later said that she did not want to participate if the Ukrainians didn&#39;t want her there.) A month later, PEN declared it “regrettable” and “wrongheaded” when the writer Elizabeth Gilbert suspended publication of her next novel because Ukrainian readers were upset that it was set in Soviet Russia. All of this merely shows that it&#39;s easier to hold a principled position on free speech when you&#39;re not the one facing unpleasant consequences.<br><br> PEN spent months researching and internally debating the new report, anticipating controversy. An early draft was hampered by reflexive hedges and tactical critiques, and a few of them remain in the published report: Accusations of literary harm “risk playing into the hands of book banners” on the right who use the same rhetoric; the publisher of <em>American Dirt</em> might have avoided trouble if it had marketed the novel with more sensitivity.<br><br> The report is an important, even courageous, document in our moment. PEN is offering guidance and backbone for a book trade that appears to have lost its nerve and forgotten its mission in the face of ceaseless outrage. Among its recommendations, the report urges that “publishing houses should rarely, if ever, withdraw books from circulation.” It calls for greater transparency and author involvement in any decisions about cancellations. Goodreads, the online review site, where mobs <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/goodreads-review-bombing-amazon-moderation/674811/">sometimes beat books to death before they&#39;re even finished</a> , let alone published and read, is asked to “encourage authentic reviews” and prevent “review-bombing.”<br><br> These technical fixes would greatly improve policies and procedures in the publishing industry, but they can&#39;t solve the wider problem—a climate of intolerance and cowardice that stifles the book world. In the conclusion to its report, PEN calls for “a broader tonal shift in literary discourse,” which is necessary but probably beyond the power of any report. Essentially, PEN is saying to the remaining gatekeepers, “Remember your purpose,” and to the new gate-crashers, “Don&#39;t use speech to limit speech.” For inspiration it reprints “The Freedom to Read” in full and urges workers in the book world to take it to heart. Ayad Akhtar, the president of PEN America, told me that he hopes publishers will include the 70-year-old manifesto along with DEI training for new hires. PEN wants its report to have an effect similar to that of the earlier document—to make publishing once more “a fighting profession.”<br><br> And yet something holds the report back from using the full-throated language of “The Freedom to Read <em>.</em> ” I think the difficulty lies in an earlier report that PEN published last year.<br><br> In “Reading Between the Lines: Race, Equity, and Book Publishing,” PEN examined in detail how the American book business has always been and, despite recent improvements, remains a clubby world of the white, well connected, and well-off. It presented a damning picture, backed by data, of “the white lens through which writers, editors, and publishers curate America&#39;s literature.” It called for publishers to hire and promote more staff of color, publish more books by writers of color, pay them higher advances, and sell their books more intelligently and vigorously.<br><br> The two reports are related, but the relation is fraught. The first showed the need for an intensified campaign of diversity, equity, and inclusion across the industry. The second argues for greater freedom to defy the literary strictures of diversity, equity, and inclusion. Is there a contradiction between the two?<br><br> PEN doesn&#39;t think so. The new report states: “It is imperative that the literary field chart a course that advances diversity and equity without making these values a cudgel against specific books or writers deemed to fall short in these areas.” In the words of Suzanne Nossel, PEN&#39;s chief executive officer, “You can dismantle the barriers to publication for some without erecting them anew for others.” But this might be wishful thinking, and not only because of practical limits on how many books can feasibly be published. In a different world, it would be entirely possible to expand opportunity without creating a censorious atmosphere. In our world, where DEI has hardened into an ideological litmus test, the effort to place social justice at the center of publishing almost inevitably leads to controversies over “representation” and “harm” that result in banned books. The first report presented DEI in publishing as an urgent moral cause. The second report takes issue with “employees&#39; increasing expectation that publishers assume moral positions in their curation of catalogs and author lists.” But those employees no doubt believe that they are carrying out the vision of the first report.<br><br> Social justice and intellectual freedom are not inherently opposed—often, each requires the other—but they are not the same thing, either. “The Freedom to Read” makes this clear: “It would conflict with the public interest for [publishers and librarians] to establish their own political, moral, or aesthetic views as a standard for determining what should be published or circulated.” That statement was written at a time when the cause of intellectual freedom was non- or even anti-ideological. Its authors advocated no other goal than the widest and highest-quality expression of views. But in PEN&#39;s new report you can feel a struggle to reconcile the thinking of its earlier one, in which every calculation comes down to identity, with the discriminating judgment and openness to new and disturbing ideas that are essential to producing literature. As one editor told me, “There&#39;s no equity in talent.”<br><br> Last year, a federal judge blocked a bid by Penguin Random House, the largest publisher in America, to buy Simon &amp; Schuster, the third largest (a takeover would have practically made the conglomerate a sovereign country). This year, book sales are down across the industry, bringing waves of layoffs; last month, senior editors at Penguin Random House were given the option of a buyout under the shadow of termination, and some of the most illustrious gatekeepers in publishing headed for the door. These events bring me to the third and most serious attack on the written word.<br><br> This one is more insidious and pervasive and therefore harder to see clearly, let alone oppose, than book bans and cancellations. It&#39;s the air every writer and reader breathes: the consolidation of publishing into a near-monopoly business; the correspondent shrinking of heterodoxy and risk taking; the fragile economic situation of employees; the withering away of bookstores and book reviews; the growing illiteracy of the public; the decline of English instruction in schools, regardless of political pressures; the data crunching that turns ideas into machine-made products and media into highly sensitive barometers of popularity (with artificial intelligence coming soon to replace the last traces of human originality). All of these trends amount to an assault on the free intellect perpetrated not by Moms for Liberty or YA Twitter, but by Mark Zuckerberg, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Amazon. In a sense, this third attack underlies the other two, because strong emotions and extreme language are programmed into the brains of book banners of every type by algorithms that profit a handful of technology and media giants.<br><br> Literature and journalism have never been remunerative fields. But compared with three decades ago, the chances of a serious, sustained career today are far slimmer. I can&#39;t help thinking that these circumstances have something to do with the willingness of publishers to be frightened by a few hundred tweets. Perhaps years of consolidation and precarity have so weakened their conviction in the mission of book publishing that a little outrage online and in house is sufficient to erase it. If the editor&#39;s function is to match the identity of writer and subject matter, then gather data to measure the success of the product, perhaps gatekeepers have finally outlived their usefulness.<br><br> <em><small>This article previously misstated Suzanne Nossel&#39;s title at PEN America.</small></em><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 11:31:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/freedom-to-read-pen-america-censorship/674936/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/freedom-to-read-pen-america-censorship/674936/</item></channel></rss>
