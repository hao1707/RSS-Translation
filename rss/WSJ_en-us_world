"></div><p>台湾官员过境美国（正式称为过境）是华盛顿和台北之间精心安排的一部分，目的是让台湾领导人在两国政府于 1979 年断交后在美国领土上与对方进行接触。</p><p>台湾外交部上个月表示，赖智过境的安排与以往的做法没有什么不同，不应成为中国进行挑衅的借口。</p><p>最近的民意调查显示，执政的民进党总统候选人赖智在明年接替蔡英文总统的竞选中处于领先地位，不过观察人士表示，三人竞争太不稳定，无法选出最受青睐的候选人，距离大选还有几个月的时间。一月份的选举。</p><p>在黎智英出访之前，中国官方媒体抨击黎智英是一心煽动紧张局势的分裂分子。北京认为他比蔡英文更热衷于台独。部分原因是他之前曾发表过言论，包括2017年他将自己描述为“台独”的“务实”工作者。</p><p>黎智英表示，如果当选，他不会寻求改变台湾与大陆之间的现状。在周一播出的电视采访中，黎智英在谈到他 2017 年的言论时表示，他指的是他将如何努力保护台湾的主权。 “事实是台湾不是中华人民共和国的一部分，”他说。</p><p>美国和台湾官员计划在黎智英过境美国期间对其保密。预计他将与纽约和旧金山的台湾社区成员会面。与蔡英文在三月底和四月初的停留不同，赖智不会发表公开言论，不会会见美国智库学者，也不太可能会见除处理台湾政策的官员以外的政府官员，尽管国会议员可能会到场。</p><p>黎智英一行的代表上个月前往华盛顿，部分原因是为此次访问做准备。据一位知情人士透露，美国官员传达的信息是：美国正在倾听黎智英的每一句话。</p><p>拜登政府担忧的原因之一是黎智英最近在竞选时发表的言论，称他期待“台湾总统能走进白宫”的那一天。这番言论引起了人们的关注，因为这表明赖智可能正在寻求对台湾的全面外交承认，这对北京来说是一条红线。</p><p>美国国务院没有回应置评请求。</p><p>中国军队，即中国人民解放军，几乎每天都加强了对台湾防空识别区的入侵，周日派出两打喷气式战斗机、轰炸机和其他飞机在台湾附近出动，周四又派出 33 架次。</p><p>中国国家电视台本周还开始播出纪念中国人民解放军成立 96 周年的八集纪录片系列《追梦》，其中包含台湾周边军事演习的镜头。其中包括对一名中国喷气机飞行员的采访，他说，如果真正爆发战斗，“我的战斗机将是我的最后一枚导弹”。</p><p>周五，即赖昌星启程前往美国的前一天，中国海事当局宣布在距离台湾东北约 300 英里的浙江省沿海举行为期三天的军事演习。台北国防部表示，岛内军方将密切关注此次演习。</p><p> “中国在认知战中使用的一种策略是通过夸大传播信息来放大例行演习，”台湾军方发言人孙丽芳少将在周六赖智前往纽约之前接受采访时表示。他在谈到这次演习以及中国可能做出的反应时表示，“这是为了放大对台湾进行例行演习的威胁。”</p><p>一些政治分析人士预计，中国将进一步加强在台湾附近的军事活动，以回应赖的访问，甚至可能<a href="https://www.wsj.com/story/as-china-warns-taiwan-heres-where-frictions-stand-05c9cba2?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">重复四月份的实弹演习</a>。</p><p>北京“不会反应过度，但他们肯定会做出反应，”新加坡南洋理工大学研究中国外交政策的助理教授迪伦·卢(Dylan Loh)表示。他表示，“虽然目前与华盛顿建立更好的关系符合北京的利益”，但这并不意味着中国领导人会在认为有必要时回避对台湾采取强硬行动。</p><p>尽管如此，分析人士表示，北京将不得不考虑过去展示军事力量是如何激起台湾人的怨恨的。 1996 年台湾总统选举之前，中国在台湾附近进行了军事演习并发射了导弹，当时的总统李登辉以 54% 的支持率获胜，他曾帮助台湾走向民主，并被视为支持台湾独立。投票。</p><p>在澳大利亚国立大学教授台湾研究的政治学家宋文蒂表示，如果中国对赖的过境反应强烈，“实际上会对北京产生适得其反的效果”。</p><p>写信给 Chun Han Wong（ <a href="mailto:chunhan.wong@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">chunhan.wong@wsj.com）</a> 、Joyu Wang（ <a href="mailto:joyu.wang@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">joyu.wang@wsj.com）</a>和 Charles Hutzler（ <a href="mailto:charles.hutzler@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">charles.hutzler@wsj.com</a> ） </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

They soon realized their mistake but later said he himself had facilitated terrorists.<br><br> Rabbani denies that, and he was never charged with a crime. After 18½ years at Guantanamo Bay, he stepped off a plane in Pakistan in February—a free but broken man.<br><br> Years of hunger strikes and force feeding have left him unable to eat most solid food. “I never, never, ever sleep at night,” he said. “If I fall asleep, I wake back up immediately.”</p><p> Through it all, he said, his only means of escape was art. He began making paintings inside his cell, standing day and night at an easel, sometimes forgetting where he was and what had happened since he was detained in 2002. By the time of his release, he had made hundreds of paintings on canvas and scraps of fabric torn from old prisoner clothing or bedsheets.</p><p> Art is among the few existing testaments to life inside the Guantanamo Bay facility, which opened a few months after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB1011739405790755840?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">to hold foreign suspects in America&#39;s war on terror.</a> In May, 20 of Rabbani&#39;s paintings were shown at a gallery in the Pakistani city of Karachi. US authorities didn&#39;t allow some works depicting torture and suffering to be taken from Guantanamo, but other artists re-created them from descriptions written by Rabbani&#39;s lawyer.</p><p> “They didn&#39;t just damage me, they damaged my whole family,” Rabbani, now 53 years old, said in a video interview from his Karachi home. </p><div class="media-object scope-

He said he found out about it three years later from a letter—the first communication he had received from her since his detention. He met his 20-year-old son, Jawwad, for the first time upon his return to Pakistan in February.</p><p> The US Defense Department didn&#39;t comment on the circumstances under which Rabbani was initially detained.</p><p> Parts of Rabbani&#39;s account are corroborated in a declassified summary of a 2014 US Senate Intelligence Committee report. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), then chair of the committee, said the findings documented “a program of indefinite secret detention and the use of brutal interrogation techniques in violation of US law, treaty obligations, and our values.”</p><h3> The Detention</h3><p> Rabbani said he was working as a taxi driver in Karachi at the time of his detention. He spoke three languages—Urdu, Arabic and English—making him a valuable resource for foreign visitors. He said he didn&#39;t ask his passengers too many questions.</p><p> “I was working to feed my family,” he said. “That&#39;s all.” </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

US intelligence officers believed Rabbani was a man named Hassan Ghul, an alleged associate of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.</p><p> “Interestingly, he denies being Hassan Ghul—claiming Hassan Ghul is someone else,” read a CIA cable about the interrogation cited in the Senate report. Within a day, it was determined Rabbani was indeed the wrong man, the report said.</p><p> But an acquaintance arrested alongside him, Muhammad Madni, told interrogators that Rabbani himself had links to al Qaeda, the report said. He gave them information that led to the arrest the next day of 11 other men—including Rabbani&#39;s older brother, Abdul. Abdul was also released and returned to Pakistan in February, without ever being charged.</p><p> Rabbani said he was transferred several times to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-court-rules-against-poland-in-cia-rendition-case-1406193988?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">camps in Pakistan and Afghanistan known as black sites</a> —secret CIA interrogation facilities. There, he said, he was tortured until he told his captors anything he thought they wanted to hear. Loud techno music blasted at all hours. He stood in darkness, awake and in pain, for what felt like days. He believed he was underground, in a dungeon.</p><p> “All this time I never saw the sun,” he said. </p><div class="media-object scope-

These included forced standing, cold temperatures and attention grasps, a practice of suddenly grabbing the detainee with both hands, by the collar, and drawing him close. He said he also suffered other abuses: sleep deprivation, beatings, stress positions.</p><p> In September 2004, he was hooded and led onto a plane that flew him to Guantanamo.</p><h3> The Allegation</h3><p> Only a few documents related to Rabbani&#39;s case have ever been made public. A detainee profile described him as a facilitator for <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/plea-bargains-are-being-discussed-for-sept-11-defendants-11647377742?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks</a> , and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, accused of orchestrating the 2000 bombing of USS Cole, an American warship, both of whom are being held at Guantanamo pending military trials. The profile says Rabbani operated safe houses and arranged travel for al Qaeda operatives and their families.</p><p> The US Defense Department didn&#39;t provide responses to The Wall Street Journal&#39;s questions about Rabbani&#39;s detention and treatment. It provided legal documents pertaining to Rabbani, including an unclassified summary of facts the US government submitted to a US court in 2013 to substantiate his detention.</p><p> The summary says Rabbani, who also goes by the name Badr, confessed to attending extremist training camps in Afghanistan, working for high-ranking extremist leaders and helping plan terrorist activities. It says he met Osama bin Laden and ran safe houses for al Qaeda and Taliban forces.</p><p> Rabbani denies all of it. He said he made false confessions while being tortured. Defense lawyers say this was a common pattern among Guantanamo detainees.</p><p> “They were beating the s—out of people to get information out of them,” said Thomas Wilner, a defense attorney for several Guantanamo detainees. “A lot of the intelligence they got was just wrong.”</p><h3>艺术</h3><p>Under the Obama administration, some attempts were made to make life at Guantanamo more tolerable for detainees. In 2009, lawyers said, basic classes were offered for the first time, in subjects such as English, computer science and art.</p><p> Rabbani, who had dabbled in drawing as a child, opted for art. But the rules were so prohibitive that he gave up after a few sessions. Inmates painted with one ankle chained to the floor. Each time they wanted to use a brush or a dab of color, the teacher had to pass it to a guard who would examine it before handing it to them. Most of the daily hourlong class was spent waiting for materials. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

When he took up painting again, it consumed him. He asked his lawyers to bring him DVDs about famous artists and watched a 2000 biopic about the American abstract expressionist Jackson Pollock over and over, he said.</p><p> His lawyers brought him brushes made entirely of plastic. Only acrylic paint was allowed because oils came in metal tubes that could be fashioned into knives or other tools.</p><p> Rabbani made sketches of his cell, a small windowless room with a toilet next to his bed. Other paintings re-created memories of life before his arrest, like a pilgrimage to the Islamic holy site of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. A few, the ones that were censored, showed dark scenes of suffering: a man hung by his wrists from a metal beam overhead; a chair to which Rabbani was strapped for force feeding during his hunger strikes.</p><p> “You can imagine why they wouldn&#39;t let these pictures out,” said Rabbani&#39;s lawyer, Clive Stafford Smith. “It&#39;s not an issue of national security, but of national embarrassment.” </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Eight were initially prohibited from leaving, though three were later released.</p><p> “Slightly left of center is the feeding chair, which looks rather like an electric chair, with seven leather restraint straps, their buckles falling open—two for the ankles, two across the upper legs, two for the wrists, and one across the chest,” reads Stafford Smith&#39;s description of a painting showing the room where Rabbani alleges he was painfully force-fed during his yearslong hunger strike. The lawyer titled the description “Dining Out in Guantanamo Bay.”</p><p> In late 2017, Rabbani was one of eight artists in Guantanamo whose work was exhibited at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York.</p><p> Guantanamo is being slowly dismantled. A total of 779 men were at some point detained there. Like Rabbani, most were eventually released without ever having been charged with a crime.</p><p> Of the 30 detainees who remain, two have been convicted and nine await trial on charges including conspiracy, murder in violation of the law of war, hijacking or hazarding a vessel or aircraft, and terrorism in the Sept. 11 case. Seven former prisoners pleaded guilty to war-crimes charges and were transferred out of Guantanamo. Nine died in custody.</p><p> Then President Barack Obama pledged to close the facility, arguing it had damaged America&#39;s reputation and cost taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Facing opposition from Congress, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-transfers-15-guantanamo-bay-detainees-1471303872?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noreferrer noopener">he chose instead to downsize it.</a> Obama&#39;s successor, Donald Trump, rescinded Obama&#39;s directive to close the facility.

It even flew drones to monitor conditions.</p><p> Yet local authorities said in the aftermath of this week&#39;s devastation that though they knew wildfires were becoming more frequent in Hawaii, they weren&#39;t prepared for one to roar through Lahaina.</p><p> The fire hit the coastal town so quickly and caught officials so off-guard that emergency sirens didn&#39;t sound. Many panicked residents were unable to flee on the town&#39;s one clogged highway and took boats or swam to safety, if they were able to escape at all. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

It warned that Lahaina was among Maui&#39;s most fire-prone areas because of its proximity to parched grasslands, steep terrain and frequent winds.</p><p> The plan, which involved Maui and state officials, laid out a multitude of mitigation measures that needed to be undertaken to shield the area around Lahaina from fires. They included thinning vegetation near populated areas, improving wildfire-response capabilities and working with landowners and utilities to help reduce fire risk on their property.</p><p> Some of the recommendations from the 2014 plan, which was devised after more than a half-dozen community meetings, were implemented, like brush thinning efforts and public education for landowners, said the report&#39;s lead author, Elizabeth Pickett. But others, such as ramping up emergency-response capacity, have been stymied by a lack of funding, logistical hurdles in rugged terrain and competing priorities, said Pickett, co-executive director of the wildfire nonprofit. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Join the conversation below.</em></p></div></div><p> Investors have historically paid a steep penalty to hunker down in supersafe short-term government securities. For example, $100 invested in three-month Treasury bills in 1928 grew to only $2,141 by the end of last year while it became $46,379 invested in medium-grade corporate bonds and a whopping $624,534 if invested in stocks, according to data from New York University finance professor Aswath Damodaran. Especially in the years following the financial crisis, anything short-term and safe paid next to nothing.</p><p> Ray Dalio, founder of the world&#39;s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, didn&#39;t coin it, but he became perhaps most-associated with the phrase “cash is trash” during that period. He changed his tune in <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/stock-market-ray-dalio-cash-bonds-51675359763" target="_blank" class="icon none" rel="noopener">a CNBC interview</a> early this year: “Cash used to be trashy. Cash is pretty attractive now. It&#39;s attractive in relation to bonds. It&#39;s actually attractive in relation to stocks.” </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"><img width="600" height="800" src="https://images.wsj.net/im-832438?width=600" alt="不明确的" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><p> T-bills not only pay more than they have since before the financial crisis but also more than longer-term notes or bonds. The latter also would suffer <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-bet-that-high-rates-will-linger-61cdaeb7?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">much larger paper losses</a> if interest rates kept heading higher. And, as Dalio suggested, frothy stock valuations make a guaranteed 5%-plus return on bills tempting.</p><p> But there is a more disturbing reason cash might be king: Although they were called “certificates of confiscation” in the inflationary 1970s, longer-term Treasurys have been the go-to asset in times of crisis. The 10-year note&#39;s yield is literally the risk-free rate used to value all other securities.</p><p> Now, though, the government&#39;s pile of debt has swelled following the War on Terror, the global financial crisis and the Covid-19 pandemic. Low interest rates and Fed bond buying masked the strain: Interest costs recently were no higher than in the early 1990s as a share of federal spending. But the Treasury barely seized the opportunity to lock in rock-bottom rates by issuing more long-term notes and bonds.</p><p> Now it is too late. The Congressional Budget Office regularly updates its long-term budget forecasts and says that US debt held by the public will surpass gross domestic product this fiscal year and that interest on that debt will equal about three-quarters of discretionary, nondefense spending. By 2031, it will be as large.</p><p> Medicare, Social Security and, of course, interest are legally nonnegotiable. Military spending isn&#39;t really optional either. <strong>&nbsp;</strong> No wonder the federal government is described as “an insurance company with an army.”</p><p> Yet the CBO&#39;s forecast actually looks too optimistic. It envisions the net interest rate paid on that debt barely topping 3% in coming years even though short-term bills and notes yield more than 5% today. The swelling pile of debt means minor changes in assumptions now have major consequences. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"><img width="600" height="800" src="https://images.wsj.net/im-832421?width=600" alt="不明确的" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></div><p> Consider that around three-quarters of Treasurys must be rolled over within five years. Say you added just 1 percentage point to the average interest rate in the CBO&#39;s forecast and kept every other number unchanged. That would result in an additional $3.5 trillion in federal debt by 2033. The government&#39;s annual interest bill alone would then be about $2 trillion. For perspective, individual income taxes are set to bring in only $2.5 trillion this year.</p><p> Compound interest has a way of quickly making a bad situation worse—the sort of vicious spiral that has caused investors to flee countries such as Argentina and Russia. Having the world&#39;s reserve currency and a printing press that allows it to never actually default makes America&#39;s situation far better, though not consequence-free.</p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps
          wrap
"></div><p> Just letting rates rise high enough to attract more and more of the world&#39;s savings might work for a while, but not without crushing the stock and housing markets. Or the Fed could step in and buy enough bonds to lower rates, rekindling inflation and depressing real returns on bonds.</p><p> A harder-to-quantify complication of a future fiscal squeeze would be Washington&#39;s limited room to maneuver as interest costs become uncomfortable. The ability to do things such as bail out banks, underwrite lifesaving vaccines, subsidize cutting-edge technologies or even fight a war would be curtailed. An America with tight purse strings would be one with a more volatile economy, diminished international prestige and, ultimately, less-attractive assets.</p><p> Predicting when markets get seriously concerned about that is hard—budget scolds have raised countless false alarms over the years. For now, though, playing it safe in cash is a lot more appealing than it used to be.</p><p> Write to Spencer Jakab at <a href="mailto:Spencer.Jakab@wsj.com" target="_blank" class="icon ">Spencer.Jakab@wsj.com</a> </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

So while most of her neighbors had urged her to flee her home near the harbor hours earlier when they were told to evacuate, Hayashi stalled. She doused the outside of her apartment with a garden hose, hoping for the best.</p><p> At that time, Hayashi, a 57-year-old harbor employee, hadn&#39;t smelled any smoke or seen any flames.</p><p> “I thought it was safe,” Hayashi said. “And there was just nowhere to go.”</p><p> Just a few minutes later, she realized how much danger she was in when sparks sailed through her air-conditioning vent. She looked outside to find her neighbor&#39;s house on fire.</p><p> Within seconds, her front room was engulfed in flames, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/maui-wildfires-recovery-efforts-continue-as-death-toll-hits-55-8ce5a88a?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">thick, black smoke</a> began filling her home.</p><p> “I thought, &#39;Oh, my God. Is this how I&#39;m going to die?&#39;” Hayashi said.</p><p> She fled through a backdoor and into the yard. She hoisted herself over a fence and made her way to Front Street, the town&#39;s main commercial boulevard, where she encountered her friend Phil Bailey.</p><p> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-maui-wildfires-hawaii-devastating-84651f12?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">Embers rained down</a> all around them against a pitch-black sky. Bailey kept patting her arms and shoulders, trying to keep the embers from igniting her clothes. “It looked like a bunch of meteors flying by, like billions of them, spinning,” she recalled.</p><p> The safest place for them to go, Bailey said, was right in front of them: the Pacific Ocean. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

There they waited, being battered by the waves and high tide, rocks pummeling their feet, for what she guessed was six or seven hours. For much of the time, they had to dodge burning palm fronds and tree branches falling into the water.</p><p> Hayashi said the water around them grew slick with ashy muck and diesel fuel from downed boats. Occasionally, she and Bailey would stand up to warm their bodies in the hot, blowing air of the fires. They would then duck back in the water to reduce the risk of being burned. At one point, Hayashi swatted away a piece of smoldering debris as big as a softball.</p><p> For the duration, Hayashi squinted and stared at the inferno. “I&#39;d see swaying palm trees, and it gets brighter, brighter, brighter red,” she recalled. “I can&#39;t stop seeing it right now, I looked at it for so long.”</p><p> The <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/hawaii-maui-fire-risks-plans-government-e883f3a3?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">town burned all night</a> .</p><p> Before daybreak, exhausted and afraid of drowning, Hayashi dragged herself onto the rocky shore. She guided Bailey, who was having trouble seeing. When the sun rose, she realized the extent of his burns.</p><p> “His skin was all gone, from his shoulder to his hand,” she said.</p><p> She started looking for help, walking shoeless through what looked to her like a war zone.

She got bandages and oxygen and took a shower. She had been covered in soot, and the nurses said they were surprised to see her auburn-red hair once she washed off.</p><p> “I was stupid to stay that long,” said Hayashi, who was still wondering if her cats made it out. “I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m alive.”</p><p> Bailey couldn&#39;t be reached for comment. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

When winds kicked up Tuesday afternoon, a dozen or so neighbors and friends gathered at his home. The wildfire smoke still seemed far away, so he started up a generator, made some burgers and put on the movie “Shrek.”</p><p> “I was thinking we&#39;re going to stick it out together like we have in the past,” said Campbell, 37, who worked for a local boat-tour business. “Normally there&#39;d be like a hurricane siren or something. None of that stuff went off.”</p><div class="media-object scope-web

His stomach turned when he saw how quickly the blaze was moving.</p><p> “The wind was just so powerful and so fast that the buildings and the trees were just like match heads next to each other,” he said. “There was no outrunning it.”</p><p> He rushed back to his fiancée, Tasha Anderson, eight months pregnant with their first child. Friends argued that it was pointless for them to leave, since the only road out of town was jammed with cars. Not long before, county officials had issued an advisory, saying those on the west side of the island should shelter in place unless ordered to evacuate.</p><p> Panicked, Campbell grabbed his wallet, his passport and a few other possessions along with his cat and dog. He threw the couple&#39;s newly installed child car seat aside to make room for a friend, and the three of them drove out through an emergency gate in their neighborhood and onto a back road, making their way to the highway.

They had recently painted and organized a nursery for the baby, complete with murals of a swinging monkey and neat rows of diapers, burp cloths and pacifiers.</p><p> He wasn&#39;t sure whether his landlords would be able to rebuild, and if they did, how he would make a living to support his family. Both vessels he had used for work were destroyed.</p><p> The couple have been hopping from one property to another, crashing at places owned by friends of friends or acquaintances. They don&#39;t know where they would be bringing their baby boy, whom they plan to name Kade, but they do know they want to raise him in Lahaina.</p><p> “We just get waves of sadness, thinking about what we thought was going to be our life,” Campbell said. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

He had grabbed a few possessions, his dog, Brutus, and a couple of friends on his way out of town. But his Prius&#39;s gas tank was empty, and no service stations were open.</p><p> He started to drive, and the car was puttering along—more stop than go in the midst of the gridlock. He worried they would run out of gas before they could get to safer ground. In the distance, they could see little else but headlights of other fleeing vehicles and the orange glow of flames against the night sky.</p><p> Stalled for what felt like an eternity, Miller struck up a conversation with another motorist, who told him about a canister of gas he kept on his back porch. The man gave him his address and said if he was willing to risk it, the fuel was his.</p><p> Miller exited the car, put on a headlamp and ran. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

He could see the backlit palm trees swaying against a glowing sky. Explosions were loud and close, he said, maybe one or two blocks away. The wind-swept flames roared and hissed around him.</p><p> “Stealing gasoline from a fire,” he muttered to himself while he recorded his exit. “Genius.”</p><p> By the time he made it back to his car and his friends, traffic had lightened. They drove north, arriving at a friend&#39;s house at around 10:30 pm</p><p> The next day, Miller&#39;s landlord sent him a photo of their home, now merely a stone wall surrounded by ashes.

The sales were down a third from June and from the same period a year ago. They were also 59% less than the total in July 2021.</p><p> July tends to be a slower month for new-home sales in China, because developers often try to boost June sales to report better first-half results. In June, a developer in the eastern city of Hangzhou offered to give people 2.2 pounds of gold—worth the equivalent of about $70,000—if they purchased homes exceeding 1,000 square feet in floor area. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Country Garden&#39;s July contracted sales plunged 60% from a year ago, a far bigger drop than in the past few months.</p><p> Yan, who is based in the city of Zhuhai in China&#39;s southern Guangdong province, said his team&#39;s sales in July were less than a quarter of their monthly average for the first half, even though his company offered bigger discounts on the properties it marketed.</p><p> The wait-and-see attitude of home buyers is worrying, say economists, as it could prolong the recovery in the housing market and correspondingly, the Chinese economy. China has also <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-slips-into-deflation-in-warning-sign-for-world-economy-bbefb179?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">slipped into deflation</a> , which could be damaging if falling consumer prices make people expect to pay less for a range of goods.</p><p> To draw home buyers, property developers have been doling out perks like free parking and household appliances. Property agents said that has trained people to expect such freebies, and sales decline whenever the deals go away.</p><p> Chinese commercial banks have also slashed rates on home loans to the point that the average mortgage rate is now below China&#39;s five-year loan prime rate, the benchmark that longer-term debt is typically pegged to. The national benchmark has also been lowered several times in the past two years.</p><p> Average prices of new and resale homes across 70 major Chinese cities have declined in the past few months, and policy makers have become more vocal about the need to support the housing market.</p><p> Chinese authorities late last year dialed back a deleveraging campaign that had caused dozens of property developers to default on their debts, and rolled out measures to stimulate demand and support surviving developers with ample financing.</p><p> That, along with China&#39;s post-Covid reopening and pent-up purchase demand, caused housing sales to pick up in the first few months of 2023—a welcome relief for developers and stock and bond investors. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

As prices fell, more people began to realize that there were still big problems in the real-estate market, said Wei Yao, a China economist at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/SCGLY" class="">Société Générale</a> <span class="company-name-type">.</span></p><p> “Coupled with a lackluster overall economic recovery, people&#39;s lower expectations and outlook for income and employment, people have become more realistic, and all those concerns may have erupted in July,” she said.</p><p> In late July, China&#39;s Politburo, its top-decision making body, said it was time to adjust property policies and omitted a long-held mantra that “housing is for living, not for speculation” for the first time in years. Cities across the country responded by offering measures including cash subsidies and tax rebates on home purchases, raising limits on how much home buyers can borrow from banks, and removing restrictions on additional home purchases.</p><p> China&#39;s annual housing demand is estimated to be between nine and 10 million units a year, according to Robin Xing, chief China economist at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/MS" class="">Morgan Stanley</a> <span class="company-name-type">,</span> versus a peak of 14 million units a year in 2021—a level that included speculative purchases. The pace of sales this year has fallen short of the estimated normalized demand, Xing said.</p><p> Until the housing market turns, home buyers have little incentive to take action, said Bruce Pang, chief China economist at <a href="https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/JLL" class="">Jones Lang LaSalle</a> <span class="company-name-type">.</span> “The more it falls, the more people lose confidence. The more confidence is lost, the less likely people are to make a purchase,” he said.</p><p> Wang Tao, a 24-year-old property agent in Hefei in Anhui province, said many of his clients are waiting for an indicator that shows where the market is going. “They told me that the current price is unstable, and you don&#39;t know whether it will rise or fall.

She no longer wastes precious minutes in front of the mirror lining her lips, and wakes up feeling “more put-together.”</p><p> Whether you want to forgo foundation or tame frizzy locks, the latest in-office and at-home treatments for skin, hair, lips, lashes and brows can deliver visible results that let women do less in the long run, according to some adopters. But the luxury of rolling out of bed already looking “ready” isn&#39;t cheap. The top five minimally invasive cosmetic procedures in the US average between $389 (for laser hair removal) to $2,914 (for soft-tissue fillers) according to a 2020 American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) report. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Consider a lip flip. The procedure is designed to make your top lip curve slightly upward, an effect that&#39;s achieved by relaxing surrounding muscles with botulinum toxin injections, said Anna Guanche, a dermatologist in Calabasas, Calif. A quick, in-office option, lip flips last about three to five months and cost between $60 and $1,000. Plus, they can negate the need for lip liner.</p><h4> SAVE</h4><p> If needles make you squeamish, try an at-home lip mask—but beware of any containing cinnamon oil or capsicum, which might irritate and swell lips. Instead, look for ingredients such as peptides, hyaluronic acid, shea butter and ceramides that promise to rejuvenate and hydrate. Lawless&#39;s popular Forget the Filler Overnight Lip-Plumping Mask ($22) contains all these and, adherents say, can give you a plusher-looking pout—at least temporarily. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Lash-extensions could make eye makeup a thing of the past.</p><p class="imageCredit"> Illustration: Yordanka Poleganova</p></figcaption></figure></div><h4> SPLURGE</h4><p> Since the early 20th century, women have curled their lashes by clamping them between the jaws of a metal contraption that resembles a torture device. If you&#39;re tired of this unnerving daily ritual, consider a lash lift, which is basically a “perm” for your top lashes, said Ashley Cornett, a Los Angeles makeup artist and lash specialist. During the treatment, a specialist applies a two-step keratin solution designed to gently break down the bonds of lash hairs and then sculpts them with a silicone shield or rod. The fanned-out finish can last between eight and 10 weeks. Cornett caps off the treatment with a tint to make lashes look thicker sans mascara. She charges $250 for the combined services.</p><p> Celine Yousefzadeh, 30, founder of a New York caviar company, used to curl her lashes at least five times each morning, only to have them droop a few hours later. After her lash lift, she said, she always looks like she&#39;s wearing eye makeup.</p><p> Those seeking extra drama can opt for extensions. Chito Ozawa, a lash and brow artist in Brooklyn, uses 50 to 100 individual extensions per eye, which she applies one-by-one with tweezers and glue. To negate the need for eyeliner, she suggests splurging on denser, pricier 2D extensions (two-pronged lashes). Ozawa charges between $175 and $275 for lashes and application. The finished look can last at least three weeks.</p><p> Margaret Siple, 37, a Seattle research biologist, has thin natural lashes. Steamy daily bus rides used to cause mascara meltdowns—until she got extensions. They&#39;re “a godsend,” she said.</p><h4> SAVE</h4><p> To add length at home, try Lashify&#39;s DIY lash extensions (kits start at $145). Beloved by celebrity makeup artists, these versions attach to the underside of your natural lashes and stay put for up to seven days. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Devotees of shine-enhancing keratin treatments swear they make styling hair a speedy cinch.</p><p class="imageCredit"> Illustration: Yordanka Poleganova</p></figcaption></figure></div><h4> SPLURGE</h4><p> Two decades ago, Descano, the communications exec, tried her first in-salon keratin treatment. Back then such fixes contained harsh, noxious chemicals that left locks poker-straight but often lifeless. Today, she relies on Cezanne—an updated professional service that uses a combination of keratin, glycolic acid and sericin (a natural protein produced by silkworms) to smooth strands and boost shine without combating natural texture. Promoted as safe for straight, wavy, curly, kinky, color-treated and relaxed hair, the treatment is popular among celebrity hairstylist Mateo Jon&#39;s “wash-and-go” clients at Virgo in Los Angeles. Adena Whitlow, 36, a lawyer in Vancouver, Canada, said it helped tame the “frizzy nightmare” she developed postpartum. The silky effects, say advocates, can last anywhere from 10 weeks to five months. Costs range from $200 to $800.</p><h4> SAVE</h4><p> DIYers should look for at-home bond-building formulas that can help revitalize damaged hair. Among the newest is Epres Bond Repair Treatment ($48), an acid-free spray. Considered safe for even chemically treated strands, this concoction combines four impossible-to-pronounce ingredients intended to repair hair and up its gloss factor. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Los Angeles dermatologist Dr. Ava Shamban said the newest technique involves injecting a neuromodulator (such as Botox or Daxxify) near the bridge of the nose, into the head of each brow and directly above each arch. These pokes result in a “nice lift and pretty arch” that can last up to six months, she said. The procedure, which can cost anywhere from $500 to $2,000, can also create symmetry and reduce sagging.</p><h4> SAVE</h4><p> To articulate arches sans injections, Beverly Hills brow specialist Kristie Streicher combines a two-step keratin solution with tweezing, trimming and tinting. This quartet sets arches in an “upward, outward position” that gives a “visible lift to the entire face” for six to eight weeks, she said. At $425, the treatment is pricier than similar services, but “feeling put together at all hours of the day” is money well spent, said Carin Gerard, 64, a Montecito, Calif., artist and Streicher client. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

The Chicago real-estate broker&#39;s failed attempts to camouflage eye bags with concealer led her to Dr. Kami Parsa, an oculoplastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, and his signature Trifecta Lift. The three-in-one procedure typically involves a lower blepharoplasty (to recontour the fat pads), a fat transfer to the midface (to address volume loss) and skin tightening. Montiel expected to “come out looking like Frankenstein,” but the incisions are made inside the eyelid, so she has no visible scars. (If you can&#39;t make it to Beverly Hills, many oculoplastic surgeons can perform versions of the Trifecta Lift&#39;s three components.) Most patients experience mild swelling and bruising but return to work in seven to 10 days. This procedure is an investment—expect to wait between three and six months to see full results and plan to shell out upwards of $7,000. (Dr. Parsa&#39;s Trifecta Lift starts at $22,000.)</p><h4> SAVE</h4><p> Hyaluronic acid filler (like Juvéderm Volbella or Restylane Eyelight) is a comparatively budget-friendly brightening option. When injected under eyes, it can help counteract darkness caused by “hollowing” or lack of volume, said Dr. Shafer.</p><p> Lindsey Perlstein, 40, tried under-eye filler for the first time shortly after having a baby. “Instant gratification” is how she described the results. “By the time I walked out of the doctor&#39;s office, it looked like I had gone on vacation for two weeks,” said the Brooklynite, who works in content marketing. Results usually last at least eight months and procedures usually cost between $700 and $2,500. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

Heated to 400°C and stamped across the face and neck, the tip creates micro-channels that stimulate collagen and elastin production, said Dr. Shamban. Designed to deliver a smoother, brighter and tighter visage, the device is similar to a high-powered laser but requires less post-procedure downtime (redness and scabbing typically dissipate after a few days). It&#39;s considered safe for all skin tones and can also address acne scars, fine lines and wrinkles. Most practitioners suggest three treatments, each typically between $500 and $2,000, every four to six weeks.</p><h4> SAVE</h4><p> To achieve hydration and radiance at home, seek out products that contain carbon dioxide, which promise to boost blood flow. Lumisque&#39;s CO2Lift Carboxy Gel Treatment ($93) infuses carbon dioxide with the aim of expanding blood vessels, rushing oxygen and nutrients to the skin that promote cellular regeneration. </p><div class="media-object scope-web|mobileapps

"></div><p> Four days before he was shot dead, presidential hopeful Fernando Villavicencio traveled to a dusty town near Ecuador&#39;s Pacific coast, defying one of the country&#39;s most ruthless drug gangs on its home turf.</p><p> “Come on, here I am,” he said during a campaign rally in the sweltering town of Chone, the birthplace of the Choneros gang that has been at the center of the country&#39;s <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cocaine-trade-and-gang-violence-strike-hard-in-once-peaceful-ecuador-bad953c8?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">drug-fueled carnage</a> . “They told me to wear a bulletproof vest, but here I am in just a sweaty shirt.”</p><p> During his career as a journalist and later a politician, the 59-year-old Villavicencio often clashed with powerful people ruling the nation of 18 million.</p><p> He made enemies through investigations into government corruption, colleagues say, forcing him to hide at one point in the Amazon. While campaigning ahead of the Aug. 20 election, he pledged to fight organized crime and drug gangs that he said had corrupted the police, judges and upper echelons of political power, an assertion shared by Ecuadorean political analysts.</p><p> <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ecuador-presidential-candidate-who-had-denounced-gangs-is-assassinated-dad61aa5?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">His brazen killing on Wednesday</a> in the capital, Quito—the first time a presidential candidate has been assassinated in Ecuador—shines a spotlight on the corrosive impact of a booming cocaine trade and the emboldened gangs fueling brutal violence. </p><div class="media-object scope-

A high-ranking police official said the men had ties to an organized crime group steeped in cocaine, though a precise motive hadn&#39;t been determined.</p><p> A country roughly the size of Oregon that is sandwiched between Colombia and Peru—two countries which grow the leaf central to making cocaine—Ecuador&#39;s problems with cocaine-related crime had been marginal.</p><p> Then came two major developments: the end in Colombia of US-supported aerial fumigation of coca, the leaf used to make cocaine, and a surge in violence following the death of a key Ecuadorean cartel leader.</p><p> The 2015 end of aerial spraying in Ecuador&#39;s northern neighbor led to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/colombias-acreage-of-coca-used-to-make-cocaine-surges-to-record-11666306614?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">a massive expansion of the crop</a> and the finished product. With more cocaine available to ship into Ecuador, the last stop before export to Europe and the US, drug gangs began to battle over the growing business.</p><p> “Each one wants to control the routes and the ports,” said Mario Pazmiño, the Ecuadorean army&#39;s former director of intelligence. “That&#39;s why we have these confrontations.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

The proportion of cocaine from Ecuador destined for Europe rose from 9% in 2019 to 33% in 2021, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, or UNODC, recently reported. Cocaine also flows in large quantities from Ecuador north to Central America and on to Mexico and the US, the UN and counterdrug officials say.</p><p> Dutch authorities reported Thursday they had seized about eight tons of cocaine worth some $660 million in July at the port of Rotterdam, the largest cocaine seizure ever at the port. The cocaine was hidden in a container alongside bananas on a ship that sailed from Ecuador.</p><p> So much cocaine has been flowing through Ecuador that authorities struggled with how to destroy seized drugs, one Western official said. Another drug expert, Antoine Vella of UNODC in Vienna who writes in detail about cocaine, said: “It&#39;s a booming market. And Ecuador is paying the price.” </p><div class="media-object scope-

The Jalisco cartel, which in Mexico has challenged the state by killing politicians and judges, has become the dominant Mexican group in Ecuador, said Douglas Farah, a Washington-based international security consultant who has written frequently about the region&#39;s drug trade.</p><p> The assassination of Jorge Luis Zambrano, the head of the Choneros, Ecuador&#39;s most powerful cartel, in December 2020 was a key factor in setting off Ecuador&#39;s spiraling violence, says John Polga-Hecimovich, a Latin America expert at the US Naval Academy.</p><p> “It destroyed the Choneros monopoly on drug trafficking, created a power vacuum, and set off intense competition for the business,” said Polga-Hecimovich. </p><div class="media-object scope-

Gruesome massacres in prisons, which are controlled by gangs, are routine. Gunmen kill police officers and prosecutors.</p><p> “It is obvious that we are losing the war against these cartels,” said Jan Topic, a presidential candidate who is calling for a crackdown on gangs similar to one <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-country-with-the-highest-murder-rate-now-has-the-highest-incarceration-rate-b5401da7?mod=article_inline" target="_blank" class="icon none">carried out in El Salvador</a> by President Nayib Bukele. “Our biggest problem now is the lack of strategy, the lack of a plan and lack of objectives.”</p><p> During the campaign, Villavicencio was one of the more vocal proponents for going after drug traffickers. He pledged to build a maximum-security prison in the Amazon for gang leaders, expand antidrug cooperation with the US and purge the police of corrupt officers.</p><p> Villavicencio&#39;s wife, Verónica Sarauz, said her husband was targeted due to his willingness to go after organized crime. Villavicencio had spoken about threats from the Choneros, a prison-led organization that emerged in the 1990s and is believed to be working with Mexico&#39;s Sinaloa cartel.</p><p> “They killed my husband because he was the only one to confront the political mafias and drug traffickers in this country,” she wrote on X, the site formerly known as Twitter.<br> The breakdown of the rule of law in Ecuador raises concerns about the strengthening of organized crime elsewhere in Latin America, security experts say. Drug gangs have expanded in some regions of Colombia and Venezuela, as well as in Central America and northern Mexico.</p><p> “Democracy is under assault across the hemisphere as you have criminal groups replacing the state,” said Farah, the Washington-based security consultant. “It&#39;s one of the harbingers of what&#39;s coming as rule of law disappears.” </p><div class="media-object scope-
