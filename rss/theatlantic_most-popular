Phillip Randolph 是 1963 年华盛顿游行的幕后黑手，马丁·路德·金博士在这次游行中发表了“我有一个梦想”的演讲。这些汽车搬运工努力提升自己。但你写到，当黑人工人能够开始赚更多的钱，或拥有土地，甚至开办企业时，他们通常会避免“成功的外在迹象”。种族主义者认为他们傲慢，甚至忘记了自己的地位。但黑人精英呢？他们对当时和现在的黑人工人阶级有何看法？<br><br><b>凯利：</b>如果你回顾一下 19 世纪末和 20 世纪初的黑人报纸，你会发现他们告诫工人，“不要出去把钱花在这些特殊的事情上。要非常节俭。不要去酒吧买这些漂亮的衣服在周日穿。”因此，这与当前的黑人精英有相似之处。这是黑人社区长期以来一直流传的一个古老的比喻：以某种方式，你可以通过某种方式摆脱使工人阶级生活变得更加困难的环境。<br><br>享乐的空间、享受的空间以及对你的外表和拥有的东西感到自豪的空间，以及工薪阶层花钱的方式一直受到批评。 “我看起来不像我的工作；我看起来像我想要的样子”——这种自豪感传统上是黑人工人阶级的东西。虽然今天戴上Gucci腰带什么的看起来很不一样。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/04/how-build-union-victory-amazon-staten-island/629464/">阅读：有组织的劳工正在卷土重来吗？</a><br><br><b>肯迪：</b>黑人工人阶级成员不仅为快乐、享受和自豪开辟了空间。他们为政治、组织和工会开辟了空间。您谈到今天黑人工人阶级的成员比任何其他种族群体更有可能成为工会成员。根据您的研究，您认为为什么会发生这种情况？也就是说，你认为为什么黑人处于我们这个时代工会组织和激进主义热潮的最前沿？<br><br><b>凯利：</b>我认为黑人工人对工会的叙述以及工会可能具有的价值有不同的看法。黑人工人已经采取了批判的立场，他们说：“好吧，不，让我自己评估一下。不，实际上我认为工会会有帮助！”走到一起是帮助我们、提升我们的一种方式。它符合我们在家庭和社区中所生活的更广泛生活的叙述。工会只是与黑人社区随着时间的推移而奋斗的方式产生共鸣，这就是为什么我们看到黑人从自由的最初时刻一直到现在都在组建工会。<br><br><b>肯迪：</b>你甚至将被奴役的黑人逃跑描述为参与新生的劳工罢工。<br><br><b>凯利：</b>当然。他们明白自己的劳动带来了多大的改变。我们常常忘记，被征服的人也有理智的生活。<br><br><b>肯迪：</b>当然。这让我想起了你书中的两句话，我希望你能反思一下。第一部分涉及我们刚才谈论的内容——米妮·萨维奇（Minnie Savage），一个受剥削和受限制的佃农的孩子，如何知道她在弗吉尼亚州阿科马克县采摘庄稼的价值。 16岁时，她逃亡。你写道：“米妮梦想生活在一个不再感觉自己是奴隶的地方。一个她的辛勤工作可以得到公平报酬的地方。一个她可以安全地与其他人一起要求公平待遇的地方。她不得不离开阿科马克才能“摆脱自由”。<br><br><b>凯利：</b>我喜欢米妮这个人物，能接受她的采访真是一份礼物。她恰好来自我祖父的家乡。当她前往费城时，跟随她真是太有趣了。请记住，对于很多人来说，移民是一个充满可能性的伟大梦想，是一种新的、更广泛的、更强大的事物的愿景。记录了她对移民后头几十年所发生的事情的失望，然后也记录了她最终确实得到了更强大的东西，以及她真正感到自豪的东西——她是一个令人惊叹的人物。<br><br><b>肯迪：</b>最后：“特朗普引发的对白人工人阶级的痴迷……掩盖了这样一个现实：美国最活跃、最投入、最有见识和最热情的工人阶级是黑人工人阶级。”<br><br><b>凯利：</b>我是一位研究黑人的学者，我爱黑人。我认为，当我们转移目光，当我们以不同的方式思考，当我们关注他人并从他们的历史中收集信息时，我们会学到很多东西。黑人生活可以教会我们很多东西，让我们知道什么是可能的。<br><br></div>

分钟的计时器，然后埋头读书，看不到手机，并且在闹钟响之前不要停下来。他们经常告诉我，当他们这样做时，时间的流逝会有所不同。最初的几分钟很拖沓，而且练习感觉完全不可能且无聊，但当他们继续坐着阅读时，他们开始关注面前书页内的世界。到最后，他们通常会对计时器的响起感到惊讶，并渴望继续阅读。<br><br>我的学生并不是唯一从这项练习中受益的人，而且这项活动适用于任何书籍。但这份清单将为您提供一个良好的开端。下面的七个标题有意识地旨在吸引读者的注意力，无论是通过形式还是内容。每一篇都会以不同的方式引导您阅读：有些简短而简洁；有些则简洁明了。其他的则又长又蔓延。有些使用第二人称直接向读者讲话；有些则使用第二人称。其他人则深入研究某一主题并邀请您一起参与。但它们的共同点是都能刷新你的观察力，让你最终以一种新的方式看待现实世界。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/mrs-caliban-rachel-ingalls/9780811226691?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>《卡利班夫人》</em></strong></a> <strong>，雷切尔·英格尔斯著</strong><br><br>我向陷入阅读低谷的人推荐的第一本书是<em>《卡利班夫人》</em> ，这是一本不到 150 页的中篇小说，情节引人入胜，节奏很快。 <em>《卡利班夫人》</em>写于 1982 年，但于 2017 年重新发行，讲述了 20 世纪 50 年代风格的孤独家庭主妇多萝西遇见拉里的故事，拉里是一种两栖海洋生物，看起来几乎与人类一模一样，只是皮肤呈绿色，手脚有蹼。拉里在多萝西的家里躲避了科学家的绑架，两人在她丈夫弗雷德的眼皮底下发生了一段奇怪的恋情。多萝西和弗雷德“太不高兴了，不愿意离婚”，所以拉里实际上是一位受欢迎的客人，他不仅为多萝西提供有关水下世界的异国故事，而且还倾听她作为家庭主妇的挣扎。人们（包括我的学生）推测吉列尔莫·德尔·托罗的电影<em>《水形物语》</em>大致是根据《<em>卡利班夫人》</em>改编的，这是有道理的——英格尔斯的写作具有催眠性和电影感，而<em>《卡利班夫人》</em>是那种你可以一口气读完的书。坐着：它像大片一样吸引你的注意力。<br><br><a

Jemisin</strong><br><br><em>第五季</em>的结尾有我在任何推理小说或奇幻小说中最喜欢的部分：在情节停止后出现的大量术语表，例如<em>食石者</em>、<em>无社群</em>和<em>原原者</em>，帮助读者解释极其非传统的事物。书的世界。这在这里很有帮助，因为这个复杂的故事发生在一个名为“寂静”的超级大陆上，该大陆正处于其常规启示录的边缘，即所谓的“第五季”，即灾难性气候变化的时期。能够利用热能制造地震事件的“原原人”被认为是危险的人，大多数人都躲藏起来，远离社会。杰米辛的主角埃松就是其中之一，她隐藏自己的真实身份，在村庄里担任教师。有一天，她回到家，发现她的丈夫谋杀了她的儿子并绑架了她的女儿——她们都继承了她的力量。当她周围的世界崩溃时，她必须在一个神秘的孩子的陪伴下踏上拯救女儿的旅程。读完<em>第五季</em>的几章后，您将沉浸在这个新世界及其错综复杂的世界中，并为这个社会结构揭示我们自己最糟糕的现实的方式而着迷。<br><br><strong>伊塔洛·卡尔维诺《</strong> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/if-on-a-winter-s-night-a-traveler-italo-calvino/9780156439619?affiliate_id=atl-347"><strong><em>如果是冬夜的旅人》</em></strong></a><br><br>一个具有实验性或神秘结构的故事会让你变成一名侦探，不仅试图弄清楚发生了什么，而且还试图弄清楚为什么写作是这样的。对我来说，这方面最令人愉快的作品是伊塔洛·卡尔维诺（Italo Calvino）的<em>《如果冬夜的旅行者》</em> ，这本书讲述了一个被称为“读者”并被称为“你”的人的故事，他在尝试阅读一本名为<em>《如果》</em>的小说时不断受到削弱。伊塔洛·卡尔维诺的<em>《冬夜的旅行者》</em> 。读者立刻发现他的副本印刷错误，与另一本小说装订在一起，然后他购买了这本小说——但他只进入了第二个选择，然后第二个选择也被打断了。他拿起的每本小说都被没收、未完成、丢失或充满错误。但当读者一个接一个地阅读故事，却永远无法读完时，他遇到了他的女性对手卢德米拉，她正在尝试阅读相同的标题。他们不可能的旅程的循环是后现代的，但基调并不抽象或理智——它有趣而甜蜜。卡尔维诺小说的元小说，字面上是写给“你”的，戏剧化地表现了集中注意力和找到合适的书的困难。具有讽刺意味的是，这本书非常容易阅读，因为读者的选择从浪漫小说到惊悚小说再到现实主义小说，所有这些都与一个男人寻找爱情的旅程交织在一起。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link"

Machado) 着</strong><br><br>短篇小说集可以采用大多数小说所不能的多种基调和风格——每个故事都可以是完全独特的。 <em>《她的身体和其他派对》的内容</em>范围令人难以置信，其中包含了有趣的、奇异的、不真实的和令人难以忘怀的内容，任何读者都能在其中找到一些吸引人的东西。马查多在中篇小说《特别令人发指》的旁边重新构思了脖子上系着绿丝带的女孩的故事，其中<em>《法律与秩序：特殊受害者》中</em>的角色与鬼魂和分身展开斗争。即使当她重复观众熟悉的电视节目时，马查多也会让已知的世界看起来很陌生；结果，超自然现象开始显得越来越合乎逻辑。在另一个故事《盘点》中，一名妇女列出了她所有的性经历，而世界正慢慢被流行病吞噬。她对过去事物的怀旧变成了对世界现状的恐惧——她的清单表面上回忆过去，但实际上讲述现在，成为应对每天带来的不确定性的一种方式。同样， <em>《她的身体和其他派对》</em>中的每个故事都同时做了很多事情，每种类型都有倾向，每个第一印象都不可靠，总是新鲜但也令人恐惧。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link"

(Robin Wall Kimmerer)</strong><br><br>基默勒的第一本书<em>《采集苔藓》</em>中，关注不是主题，而是模式。尽管她 2013 年的作品<em>《Braiding Sweetgrass》</em>深入探讨了土著知识体系和科学知识体系之间的许多重叠之处，但 Kimmerer 在这里只专注于一种生物：苔藓。在一系列简短的个人文章中，她审视了苔藓的微小世界以及它能教给我们什么。她认为，莫斯可以为我们的生活提供隐喻，帮助我们理解我们的人际关系，并向我们展示微小的事物如何秩序更大的世界。凭借她作为科学家和土著学者的背景，她向我们展示了这个微小的世界是多么丰富、多么值得尊重，以及多么令人震惊的美丽。基默勒写道，在检查苔藓后，她从显微镜中抬起头来，“对平凡世界的朴素、单调和可预测的形状感到惊讶”。基默勒的个人风格注入了多样性：每篇文章不仅提供了有关她正在观察的生物体的新信息，还提供了有关她在房屋、实验室和社区中的许多角色的新信息。最后，她启发读者像她一样看待，密切关注生活中最小的部分。<br><br>

<strong>，作者：苔丝·冈蒂</strong><br><br>阅读一本真正描绘了当地情况的书感觉有点像从家里旅行——你可以了解一个地方的历史、人民和细节的一切。甘蒂的处女作<em>《兔子笼》</em>就在这方面做出了贡献。这是一个多声部的故事，讲述了印第安纳州瓦卡谷 (Vacca Vale) 的低收入公寓 La Lapinière 的许多居民的故事，当地人将其称为“兔子小屋”。小说开始于 C4 公寓的青少年居民布兰丁·沃特金斯 (Blandine Watkins) 遭到袭击。她认为这种暴力是她身体的“出口”，这句话呼应了她对中世纪神秘主义者希尔德加德·冯·宾根的痴迷。小说从这里开始倒退，讲述了导致那一刻发生的原因，追踪了兔舍里不同的主人在七月炎热的一周里的生活：一位母亲最后告诉她，一位在线讣告评论版主让一位名人的儿子感到恼火，甚至到了危险的程度。她害怕丈夫的孩子的眼睛，而与布兰丁住在一起的三个年轻人也对她着迷。这是一次精彩的思考，探讨了我们对最近的邻居有多少不了解，以及我们居住的地方如何让我们走到一起，或者让我们分裂。<br><br>

Byatt</strong><br><br>这可能感觉违反直觉，但当没有其他事情可以吸引我的注意力时，我知道是时候做多了。与我整天看到的文章、推文和 TikTok 不同，我发现一本结构和节奏冗长的长篇小说——尤其是在一段时间内深入探讨多种心理——总是能让我保持专注。很多经典小说都提供了这一点，但我最喜欢的是拜厄特的<em>《占有》</em> ，这是一部 1990 年的小说，采用维多利亚时代的结构，并赋予它后现代的倾向。有两条时间线——一条是当代叙事，其中学者罗兰·米歇尔和莫德·贝利发现了两位维多利亚时代诗人之间的信件，并重建了一段缺失的文学史；一条是维多利亚时代叙事，其中我们看到了同一位诗人伦道夫之间的关系。亨利·阿什和克里斯塔贝尔·拉莫特。这两个情节交织着诗歌、信件和学术书籍的摘录——所有这些都是拜厄特精心撰写的。这两个世界创造了强烈的戏剧性讽刺：读者可以看到米歇尔和贝利的正确之处，以及他们的档案永远无法捕捉到的东西，提醒我们过去的领域到底是多么未知。缓慢的节奏意味着我们可以深入研究每个观点，但这本书自始至终仍然令人兴奋，因为一幅历史的图画慢慢地映入眼帘。到最后，我发现我总是渴望再次开始阅读它。<br><br></div>

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.recurrentauto.com/research/texas-electric-vehicle-trends-stats">电动汽车</a>，而电动汽车以复杂的方式与电网互动。德克萨斯州现在是美国第三大电动汽车市场；自那场冬季暴风雪发生以来，注册数量至少增加了一倍， <a

万个</a>——所有这些都运行在从未设计用于为汽车提供动力的电力基础设施上。那么，德克萨斯人询问电网是否也能做到<em>这一点</em>是可以理解的。<br><br>尽管电动汽车承诺改善气候，但许多人<a data-event-element="inline link"

Recurrent 是一家为电动汽车买家提供电池健康状况报告的初创公司，其首席执行官兼联合创始人斯科特·凯斯 (Scott Case) 指出，当温度超过 100 度时，电动汽车的续航里程可能会减少约 30%。 “没有任何电池技术能够改变物理学，”他告诉我。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/tesla-charging-stations-ford-gm-nacs/674423/">阅读：特斯拉的魔力已归结于其充电器</a><br><br>考虑到这一点，德克萨斯州是未来的领头羊，随着我们对电动汽车的依赖不断增加，而气温却永久上升，我们中的许多人很快就会生活在这个未来。你可以想象噩梦般的场景：随着天气变得更糟，电动汽车成为电网的消耗者，导致大范围停电，然后耗尽的电池将汽车变成轮子上的砖头。如此戏剧性的未来可能不会实现，但我们将无法维持现状：更加极端的气候，加上电动汽车的相对复杂性，将要求驾驶员改变他们与能源消耗的关系，以及汽车与能源消耗的关系。制造商重新考虑他们生产什么以及如何生产。<br><br>总部位于德克萨斯州的电力巨头瑞致达对接下来的发展持乐观态度。该公司负责联邦和州宣传的高级经理艾米丽·斯蒂普(Emily Stipe)是随着热度变得更加极端而寻求缓解与电动汽车相关基础设施担忧的几位能源官员之一。斯蒂普在非营利组织零排放运输协会（ZETA）最近的一次演讲中表示：“我们确实相信电网将能够应对电动汽车的部署。”但这只有在多方共同努力的情况下才会发生，“不仅包括实际的电动汽车行业本身，还包括其供应链、电力供应商和消费者”。<br><br>大多数证据表明，电动汽车不会给电网带来人们想象的那么大压力。 ZETA 估计，到 2021 年，电动汽车仅消耗全国能源发电总量的 0.15%。该组织表示，可用能源的增长远远超过了电动汽车的新需求。德克萨斯州电力可靠性委员会的发言人表示，尽管德克萨斯州的销量稳步增长，但“目前，电动汽车的负载还不足以对电网产生影响”，该委员会负责运营该州 90% 的电网， 告诉我。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2023/jun/28/texas-heatwave-power-grid-solar-energy">据报道，自 2022 年以来，太阳能发电量翻了一番</a>，这也帮助该州老化的发电厂保持供电——尽管在石油和天然气占主导地位的地方<a data-event-element="inline link"

“当你了解什么是电网弹性时，它实际上是电网准备和适应不断变化的运行条件的能力，”南加州爱迪生公司电气化总监香奈尔·帕森告诉我。她说，由于电动汽车一天中实际上只行驶了 5% 到 10% 的时间，因此“一天中剩下 21 到 23 个小时，汽车可以将电池放电给家庭甚至电网。”<br><br>这确实需要许多公用事业公司目前正在进行的“智能电网”升级，包括新的变压器、延长的电力线以及更好的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.smart-energy.com/digitalisation/cybersecurity/does-v2g-pose-a-cyber-threat-to-the-grid/">网络安全</a>。但是，在太阳能和风能较弱的日子里，电池存储有巨大的潜力可以提供帮助。斯蒂普告诉我，由于连接到电网的巨型电池，加利福尼亚州甚至在去年九月的热浪中避免了停电。通常，这些电池是对以前的电动汽车电池进行重新利用的。 “我们亲眼目睹了储能提供的许多好处，甚至超出了减排好处，”她说。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/05/where-are-the-ev-charging-stations/674241/">阅读：阻碍美国电动汽车发展的一件事</a><br><br>即使现在，大多数电动汽车都配备了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/managed-electric-vehicle-charging.html">智能充电</a>选项：能够通过汽车软件或充电器应用程序管理充电时间和电量。就像智能恒温器一样，电动汽车车主可以<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8oASdb_CjQ">安排和管理非高峰时段的充电</a>。换句话说，您可以在晚上下班回家后插入电动汽车，但安排它在夜间充电，此时电网还没有因高温而过度工作，而且全家人都在家里用电。这也可以在公共充电器上完成。<br><br>当前电动汽车领域的世界领先者长期以来一直在玩这个游戏。特斯拉提供太阳能瓷砖和家庭储能解决方案，例如 Powerwall。现在许多“传统”汽车公司都在开发竞争产品。通用汽车公司的一个新部门通用汽车能源公司正在为家庭和企业推出所谓的“电动生态系统”，包括太阳能、充电、备用电池和双向充电技术。 “如果你能够管理能源、流入和流出，作为消费者，你可以对所有这些类型的产品进行管理，那么你就有机会帮助减轻恶劣环境带来的一些问题。天气，”通用汽车发言人小达里尔哈里森告诉我。这些功能预计将随着新款雪佛兰 Silverado EV 的零售发布而推出，该车型将于今年晚些时候开始生产。<br><br>持续的热浪时代也将改变电动汽车的制造方式。许多汽车制造商正在通过添加新的硬件功能（例如<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.moveelectric.com/e-cars/what-heat-pump-and-how-do-they-benefit-electric-cars">热泵）</a>来应对极端温度导致车辆行驶里程缩短的问题。凯斯说，虽然这些通常主要被视为冬季续航里程的好处，但它们释放暖空气的能力也可以大大提高夏季的续航里程。他说，与拥有电动汽车的许多其他现实一样，热泵的使用——包括监控能源使用情况和找出<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/electric-vehicle-rental-cars-hertz-chargers/674429/">最佳充电方式</a>——需要改变司机的行为，他们几十年来只是支付汽油费然后开车离开： “每个人在成长过程中都从父母或祖父母那里学习如何保养内燃机汽车。”在新生的电动汽车时代，“现在每个人都在制定新规则。”<br><br>也许更大的挑战将是让司机、房主甚至租房者开始以不同的方式思考他们的能源使用情况。无意识地消耗燃料或电力已不再是我们的奢侈品。 “对于许多人来说，他们只是希望在按下开关时灯就亮起来，除了每年的更新期之外，他们不想考虑他们的电力计划，”斯蒂普说。 “我们确实需要改变这一点。”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 13:25:07 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

月</span>，在麦卡锡时代的鼎盛时期，国会调查人员和私人团体以国家安全、美国图书馆协会和协会图书出版商委员会的名义追捕“颠覆性”或仅仅是“令人反感的”书籍和作者发表了一份名为“阅读自由”的宣言。该文件捍卫言论自由，谴责审查制度和语言一致性，其清晰度和力度在今天令人震惊。它主张“观点和表达的最广泛多样性”，并反对基于“作者的个人历史或政治背景”的清洗工作。它敦促出版商和图书馆员抵制政府和私人压制，并“通过提供丰富思想质量和多样性的书籍，充分体现阅读自由”。该宣言不仅涉及官方审查制度，还涉及更广泛的胁迫和群体思维氛围。它的结论是：“我们提出这些主张并不是因为人们认为人们读到的内容并不重要。相反，我们相信人们阅读的内容非常重要；想法可能是危险的；但压制思想对于民主社会来说是致命的。自由本身是一种危险的生活方式，但它是我们的。”<br><br> “阅读自由”被报纸和电视新闻报道。同月，德怀特·艾森豪威尔总统敦促达特茅斯学院的毕业生不要“加入焚书者行列”，他给宣言的作者写了一封表扬信。在美国历史上最黑暗的时期之一，这份宣言给了图书馆员和出版商坚持其原则的勇气。一位图书管理员后来写道：“出现了一种战斗职业，由确信自己方向的奉献者组成。”<br><br>今年六月，图书馆和出版商协会在《自由阅读》成立 70 周年之际<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.slj.com/story/Freedom-to-Read-Statement-Reissued-on-Its-70th-Anniversary#:~:text=On%20the%2070th%20anniversary%20of,statement%20and%20reaffirmed%20its%20message.">重新发行了该书</a>。许多出版商、图书馆、文学团体、公民自由组织和作家签署了其原则。然而，许多机构签署者——包括“五巨头”出版集团——经常违反其主张，甚至可能没有意识到他们正在这样做。其中很少有人（如果有的话）能够像在审判者摧毁职业和生活的时代那样毫无歉意地捍卫知识自由。值得一问的是，为什么 2023 年的美国文坛比 1953 年的作家更无法坚持“阅读自由”的原则。<br><br>今天对知识自由的攻击来自多个方向。首先——这可能是签署者主要关心的——是州长、州立法机构、地方政府和学校董事会发起的一场官方运动，以清除他们不喜欢的书籍和想法。大多数目标在政治上属于左派；大多数内容呈现有关种族、性别和性的事实或表达观点，而审查者认为这些事实或观点是危险的、分裂的、淫秽的或完全错误的。这项努力早在 2020 年就在德克萨斯州开始，随后公众的歇斯底里和政治机会主义将这场运动蔓延到了佛罗里达州和其他州以及各级教育，从图书馆书架和课堂阅读清单上撤下了托妮·莫里森 (Toni Morrison) 等作家的数千本书。马拉拉·优素福扎伊。<br><br>鉴于州和学区有责任制定公立学校课程，并非所有这些都可以称为政府审查。但防止学生遇到有争议的、不受欢迎的、甚至冒犯性的作家和思想的法律和政策相当于一场强有力的禁书运动，其中一些可能违反宪法。这场运动源于美国的传统，即对快速变化和非正统思维的狭隘恐慌。您可以将田纳西州 1925 年的<em>Scopes</em>审判与佛罗里达州 2022 年的 Stop WOKE 法案划清界限。这种对知识自由的威胁是图书界占主导地位的进步和开明人士最容易反对的。企鹅兰登书屋或国家图书基金会的所有人都毫不犹豫地支持<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/01/books/maia-kobabe-gender-queer-book-ban.html"><em>《性别酷儿》</em></a>和<em>《使女的故事》</em> 。<br><br> “烧书的方法<span class="smallcaps">不止</span>一种，”雷·布拉德伯里曾经说过。 “世界上到处都是拿着点燃的火柴到处乱跑的人。”对知识自由的第二个威胁来自不同的来源——来自内部。这种威胁是美国笔会刚刚发布的一份新报告的主题，题为《<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pen.org/report/booklash">书荒：文学自由、网络愤怒和伤害语言</a>》。 （因为我过去<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/equity-language-guides-sierra-club-banned-words/673085/">写过有关审查制度和语言的文章</a>，笔会要求我阅读并回复早期的草稿，并给了我一份最终版本的预发副本。）该报告重点关注出版商和作者取消其出版商和作者的最新模式。自己的书，有时是在出版后，在网上或由自己的员工（通常是年轻人）组织的压力下。自 2016 年以来，国际笔会追踪了 31 起可能被称为文学杀婴的案件；一半发生在过去两年内。报告指出：“这些书都没有因为任何关于事实虚假信息、美化暴力或抄袭的指控而被撤回。” “他们的内容或作者只是被认为具有攻击性。”<br><br>一些案例成了大新闻。阿歇特公司在员工罢工后取消了伍迪·艾伦的自传，布莱克·贝利的菲利普·罗斯传记在诺顿出版后被撤回，两者都是在作者指控不当性行为之后（艾伦和贝利否认了这些指控）。出版商在某位作者发表公开言论后取消了书籍——例如漫画家斯科特·亚当斯、英国记者朱莉·伯奇尔和右翼煽动者米洛·扬诺普洛斯的书籍。<br><br>在一个特别疯狂的案例中，一位名叫娜塔莎·泰恩斯的作家在即将出版她的第一部犯罪惊悚小说的同时，看到华盛顿特区地铁系统的一名黑人雇员在火车上吃东西（违反了该系统的规则）。她在推特上发布了一张该女子在交通局的照片并提出投诉，但立即发现自己变成了一名病毒式的种族主义者。几个小时后，她的发行商稀有鸟类图书公司就放弃了这本小说，并在推特上称泰恩斯“今天做了一件非常可怕的事情”。出版商加州冷血 (California Coldblood) 在试图放弃这本书之后，最终“由于合同义务”继续出版，但这本小说就等于死了。 “你怎么能指望作家成为从不犯任何错误的完美生物呢？”泰恩斯向笔会哀叹。现在，大多数出版商都在图书合同中加入了道德条款，使这些取消合法化——这一漏洞与这些出版商所认可的“阅读自由”的原则相矛盾。<br><br>报告中讨论的许多案例与作者的攻击性言论或不良行为无关。相反，它们涉及措辞、人物塑造、情节、主题或作者身份的错误。去年，皮卡多出版社放弃了一位教师的获奖回忆录，因为该回忆录因对种族不敏感的描述而受到攻击。在批评者指出其作者​​是白人后，维普夫和斯托克撤回了一项关于黑人女权主义文化的学术研究。西蒙与舒斯特因希特勒而抢先杀掉了一本为希特勒儿童写的传记。四本青少年和儿童小说（似乎特别容易受到攻击）因涉嫌令人反感的故事和描述而被下架。其中一本名为<em>《狼群之地》（A Place for Wolves</em> ）的小说，讲述了两名美国同性恋男孩在与塞尔维亚的战争期间发生在科索沃的故事。在社交媒体上的人们指责他之后，该书的作者科索科·杰克逊（Kosoko Jackson）被取消了。科索科·杰克逊本人也是通过 Twitter 进行文学犯罪的检察官。他违反了自己关于身份的法令，对适当的主题进行了严格限制：“有关民权运动的故事应该由黑人撰写，”他在推特上写道。 “选举权的故事应该由女性来书写。因此，关于男孩在可怕和改变生活的时代（如艾滋病流行）的故事应该由男同性恋者来写。为什么这么难得到？”<br><br>这些文学“autos-da-fé”的核心是身份——或者用报告多次使用的一句话来说，“边缘化身份”。可能毁掉作家作品的绊脚石——对“有害”语言的指控、“再现”失败、“挪用”或普遍存在“问题”内容的指控——全都是沿着身份线串起来的。 2020 年，当白人作家珍妮·康明斯 (Jeanine Cummins) 因小说<em>《美国污垢》(American Dirt</em> ) 受到广泛关注（据报道还获得了七位数的图书交易）时，该小说讲述了墨西哥母子逃离贩毒团伙的故事。一些评论家说，本应属于拉丁裔作家的机会，他本可以写出一本更好的书。她的出版商熨斗/麦克米伦没有撤下这本小说——它的销量太多了——但它以安全问题为由取消了康明斯的巡演，并发表了一份卑鄙的自我批评声明。 <em>《美国污垢》</em>的磨难向出版商表明，跨越身份界限可能是危险的，这促使一位接受笔会匿名采访的前编辑问道：“我们是说不是任何人都可以写故事吗？你必须有一定的身份吗？对此有很多恐惧。”<br><br>怀疑论者可能会问，为什么每年出版的数万本书中的几十个尴尬的决定和小争议会很重要。答案是，这些事件揭示了一种从众和恐惧的氛围，这种氛围削弱了图书出版不仅仅是一项业务的主张。报告中描述的大多数被取消的书籍都是普遍正统观念的受害者。在最严格的情况下，这种正统观念将身份的主张置于一切之上——文学质量、作者独立性、阅读自由。它的影响力可以从许多被取消的书籍中明显看出，尽管笨拙，但努力遵守公平和包容的价值观；娜塔莎·泰恩斯（Natasha Tynes）试图通过辩称自己是“少数族裔作家”来保护自己免受网络攻击。<br><br>最终，正统观念使得对书籍的压制变得不必要，因为它会导致编辑和作家的自我审查。一位被取消资格的作家在接受国际笔会采访时表示：“这让我在创造性上失去了兴趣。总有一个审查员站在我的肩膀上，告诉我不能写这个或那个话题。”哪个作家能诚实地说这不是真的？几乎没有一位接受笔会报告采访的编辑愿意被提及姓名。如果他们害怕的不是作者的命运，他们还害怕什么呢？<br><br>水线以下是所有未签约的书籍，甚至是未编写的书籍，因为这些例子已被公开。畅销书作家理查德·诺斯·帕特森 (Richard North Patterson) 在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-my-new-novel-about-racial-conflict-ran-into-trouble-53a53f54"><em>《华尔街日报》的</em></a>一篇<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-my-new-novel-about-racial-conflict-ran-into-trouble-53a53f54">专栏文章</a>中写道，他的最新小说——讲述了反对投票权和白人种族主义之争的跨种族关系——被“大约 20 家”纽约出版商拒绝。帕特森写道：“似乎占主导地位的情绪是，只有那些个人受到歧视的人才能安全地通过虚构人物来描述歧视。” （ <em>《审判》</em>由田纳西州一家保守的基督教公司于 6 月出版，目前在亚马逊所有图书中排名第 37,000 名左右。笔会报告中的几本书被主要出版商取消，被影响力小得多的小出版社抢走了。）<br><br> PEN 是一个言论自由组织。在已经发布了一份<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pen.org/report/banned-usa-growing-movement-to-censor-books-in-schools/">冗长的报告</a>和大量声明谴责州和地方政府禁书之后，它似乎已经意识到，它不能忽视国内笔会成员出版和赞助其筹款晚会的组织的镇压模式。<br><br> 5月，国际笔会陷入了自己的言论自由争议，两名乌克兰士兵作家宣布，如果两名俄罗斯作家也加入另一个小组，他们将退出该组织的世界之声节。国际笔会没有取消已经抵达美国的乌克兰人，并将他们送回国内参加战争，而是要求俄罗斯作家及其小组主持人、国际笔会董事会成员玛莎·格森以不同的旗帜发言，美国笔会。相反，俄罗斯人和格森决定取消自己的活动，格森辞去董事会职务，以抗议国际笔会屈服于乌克兰人的要求。 （一位俄罗斯作家后来说，如果乌克兰人不希望她在那里，她就不想参加。）一个月后，当作家伊丽莎白·吉尔伯特暂停出版她的下一篇作品时，国际笔会宣称这是“令人遗憾的”和“错误的”。小说是因为乌克兰读者对它以苏联为背景感到不安。所有这一切仅仅表明，当你不是面临不愉快后果的人时，在言论自由问题上坚持原则立场会更容易。<br><br>国际笔会花了几个月的时间研究和内部辩论这份新报告，预计会引起争议。早期的草稿受到了反身性的限制和策略性批评的阻碍，其中一些仍保留在已发表的报告中：对文学伤害的指控“有可能落入右翼书籍横幅的手中”，他们使用同样的言辞；如果<em>《美国污垢》</em>的出版商更加敏感地推销这部小说，也许可以避免麻烦。<br><br>在我们这个时代，这份报告是一份重要的、甚至是勇敢的文件。国际笔会正在为图书行业提供指导和支柱，而图书行业在不断的愤怒面前似乎失去了勇气并忘记了自己的使命。在其建议中，报告敦促“出版社应该很少（如果有的话）将书籍从流通中撤回。”它呼吁提高透明度并让作者参与任何有关取消的决定。 Goodreads 是一个在线书评网站， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/goodreads-review-bombing-amazon-moderation/674811/">有时暴徒们甚至在书还没读完之前就把书打死</a>，更不用说出版和阅读了，它被要求“鼓励真实的书评”并防止“书评轰炸”。<br><br>这些技术修复将极大地改善出版业的政策和程序，但它们无法解决更广泛的问题——窒息图书世界的不宽容和怯懦气氛。国际笔会在其报告的结论中呼吁“文学话语中更广泛的基调转变”，这是必要的，但可能超出了任何报告的力量。本质上，笔会是在对剩下的看门人说：“记住你的目的”，并对新的闯入者说：“不要用言论来限制言论。”为了寻求灵感，它全文转载了《阅读的自由》，并敦促图书界的工作者牢记它。美国笔会 (PEN America) 主席阿亚德·阿赫塔尔 (Ayad Akhtar) 告诉我，他希望出版商将这份 70 年前的宣言与新员工的 DEI 培训一起纳入其中。国际笔会希望其报告能够产生与之前文件类似的效果——让出版业再次成为“战斗职业”。<br><br>然而，有些因素阻碍了该报告使用“阅读自由”的豪言壮语<em>。</em>我认为困难在于笔会去年发表的一份较早的报告。<br><br>在《言外之意：种族、公平和图书出版》一书中，美国笔会详细研究了美国图书业的现状，尽管最近有所改善，但仍然是一个白人、人脉广泛、富裕的俱乐部世界。它展示了一幅有数据支撑的可怕图景，即“作家、编辑和出版商通过白色镜头来策划美国文学”。它呼吁出版商雇用和提拔更多的有色人种员工，出版更多有色人种作家的书籍，向他们支付更高的预付款，并更明智、更积极地销售他们的书籍。<br><br>这两份报告是相关的，但其关系却令人担忧。第一个表明需要加强整个行业的多样性、公平性和包容性运动。第二个观点主张有更大的自由来挑战多样性、公平性和包容性的文学限制。两者之间有矛盾吗？<br><br>笔会不这么认为。新报告指出：“文学领域必须制定一条促进多样性和公平性的路线，而不是让这些价值观成为对那些被认为在这些领域达不到要求的特定书籍或作家的打击。”用国际笔会执行董事苏珊·诺塞尔的话来说，“你可以为一些人消除出版障碍，而不必为另一些人重新设置障碍。”但这可能是一厢情愿的想法，不仅因为可以出版的书籍数量受到实际限制。在另一个世界中，完全有可能在不营造挑剔氛围的情况下扩大机会。在我们的世界里，DEI 已经成为一种意识形态的试金石，将社会正义置于出版中心的努力几乎不可避免地会引发关于“代表性”和“伤害”的争议，从而导致书籍被禁。第一份报告将出版中的 DEI 视为一项紧迫的道德事业。第二份报告对“员工越来越期望出版商在目录和作者名单的管理中承担道德立场”提出了质疑。但这些员工无疑相信他们正在实现第一份报告的愿景。<br><br>社会正义和知识自由本质上并不对立——通常，两者都需要对方——但它们也不是同一件事。 《阅读自由》明确指出：“[出版商和图书馆员]建立自己的政治、道德或美学观点作为决定应该出版或发行什么的标准，这将与公共利益发生冲突。”该声明是在知识自由的事业是非意识形态甚至是反意识形态的时代写下的。其作者主张的目标就是最广泛和最高质量的观点表达。但在国际笔会的新报告中，你会感到很难调和其早期报告的思想，其中每一个计算都归结为身份，以及对创作文学至关重要的歧视性判断和对新的、令人不安的想法的开放态度。正如一位编辑告诉我的那样，“人才是不公平的。”<br><br>去年，一位联邦法官阻止了美国最大出版商企鹅兰登书屋收购第三大出版商西蒙与舒斯特公司的出价（收购实际上将使该集团成为一个主权国家）。今年，全行业图书销量下滑，带来裁员潮；上个月，企鹅兰登书屋的高级编辑在解约的阴影下获得了买断的选择，出版界一些最杰出的把关人也纷纷离职。这些事件让我想到了对书面文字的第三次也是最严重的攻击。<br><br>与图书禁令和取消相比，这一问题更加阴险和普遍，因此更难以清楚地看到，更不用说反对了。这是每个作家和读者呼吸的空气：出版业被整合为近乎垄断的行业；异端观念和冒险行为相应减少；员工经济状况脆弱；书店和书评的衰落；公众文盲率不断上升；无论政治压力如何，学校的英语教学都在下降；数据处理将想法转化为机器制造的产品，将媒体转化为高度敏感的流行晴雨表（人工智能即将取代人类原创性的最后痕迹）。所有这些趋势都构成了对自由知识的攻击，这种攻击不是由 Moms for Liberty 或 YA Twitter 发起的，而是由马克·扎克伯格 (Mark Zuckerberg)、华纳兄弟探索频道 (Warner Bros. Discovery) 和亚马逊发起的。从某种意义上说，第三次攻击是其他两次攻击的基础，因为强烈的情感和极端的语言被算法编入各种类型的书籍横幅的大脑中，这些算法使少数技术和媒体巨头受益。<br><br>文学和新闻从来都不是高薪领域。但与三十年前相比，今天从事认真、持续的职业生涯的机会要小得多。我不禁想到，这些情况与出版商愿意被几百条推文吓倒有关。也许多年的整合和不稳定已经削弱了他们对图书出版使命的信念，以至于网上和内部的一点愤怒就足以消除这种信念。如果编辑的作用是匹配作者的身份和主题，然后收集数据来衡量产品的成功，也许看门人终于失去了用处。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 11:31:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/freedom-to-read-pen-america-censorship/674936/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/freedom-to-read-pen-america-censorship/674936/</item><item><title><![CDATA[The Burden of Proof Is on the Language Police]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>关于特定术语伤害他人的说法应该以严格的方式进行评估，而不仅仅是基于直觉。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Yh_Ri7MpSMGvKtZxMP9uBhVAl9Q=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/language_horz_1/original.jpg" alt="由铁丝网制成的语音气泡的插图" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>大西洋月刊插图。资料来源：盖蒂。</figcaption></figure>在我作为科学期刊的高级编辑的工作中，我在审稿人、作者、其他编辑和读者之间调解的最具挑战性的论点不是关于研究方法、经验数据或微妙的理论观点，而是关于描述弱势群体的术语哪些是可以接受的，哪些是有害的。我的领域——毒瘾和毒品政策——有着围绕语言展开野蛮内讧的传统。那些被前几代人嘲笑为<i>流浪者</i>或<i>流浪汉</i>的人，更恰当的称呼是<i>无家可归的人</i>、无家可归<i>的人</i><i>、</i>无家可归<i>的人、有过无家可归经历的人</i>，还是其他什么？类似的争论也爆发在政治、新闻、课堂、工作场所以及餐桌上的几代人之间。当即使是真诚、善意的人也无法就哪些词语加剧社会不公正、损害人类福祉达成一致时，争论可能会导致双方互相伤害。<br><br>有时，随着时间的推移，争论会自行解决，而诸如<i>“瘾君子”</i>和<i>“瘾君子”</i>之类明显带有贬义的词语也会从公众话语中消失得无影无踪。值得赞扬的是，研究和治疗成瘾的学者敏锐地意识到负面语言如何向公众灌输负面态度，从而使公共政策针对吸毒和酗酒障碍患者。也就是说，任何有关特定术语具有积极危害性的主张在被确定为事实之前都应被视为假设。当面对“ <i>X”</i>一词对具有特定特征的人造成伤害，或者“ <i>Y”</i>一词是尊重他们的唯一方式的说法时，一个公正的人可以合理地回答：“什么证据表明这是真的？”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/brandeis-language-police-have-suggestions-you/619347/">约翰·麦克沃特（John McWhorter）：现在甚至<i>连触发警告</i>也被禁止</a><br><br>可以肯定的是，当某人明确表达了他或她希望如何被描述的偏好时，这种愿望不需要证据验证。在某些情况下，尊重他人的自我认知可能意味着容忍善意的局外人认为生硬、不礼貌甚至具有破坏性的语言。例如， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/all-about-addiction/201809/never-call-someone-alcoholic-or-addict">我所在领域的一些成员认为，</a>康复中的人不应该用<i>“瘾君子</i>”和<i>“酗酒者</i>”这些词来加重自己的负担——这些词很可能会在未经他们同意的情况下对任何被贴上这样标签的人造成侮辱，但“12步计划”的参与者广泛声称这些词。科学家和临床医生必须尊重他人的人性，其中包括维护他们发言和定义自己的权利。<br><br>当一个术语被断言有害时索要证据会让一些人觉得这仅仅是对变革的抵制。事实上，有大量关于术语影响的证据可以指导我们，并且在某些情况下，它支持语言的转变。根据我所在领域的一项研究，看到一个人被描述为<i>药物滥用者</i>而不是<i>患有</i><i>药物使用障碍，</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/002204261004000403">会让人们更有可能将其视为安全威胁并应该受到惩罚</a>。有些术语被称为有害术语，因为它们显然就是有害的。<br><br>但许多其他关于个别术语的有害性或优点的主张缺乏明确的证据，因此我们应该谦虚地进行概括。专家和政策制定者为何应该容忍广泛的术语的最佳证据是，人们所喜欢的称呼具有多样性。有一天，一位美国白人同事批评我在讨论医疗保险参与者的药物过量问题时使用了据称有辱人格的术语<i>“长者</i>”，就在我接到 Zoom 电话会议之前不久，原住民血统的加拿大同事反复使用同一个术语来表示尊重他们社区中最长寿的成员。在我作为心理学家的临床培训期间，我被告知（没有证据）“<i>病人”</i>是一个具有破坏性的医学术语，指的是寻求心理健康护理的人，我应该只使用<i>“客户”</i> 。但对现实生活中寻求护理的人的调查并未达成共识。例如，在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://uhra.herts.ac.uk/handle/2299/5733">一项研究</a>中，看精神科医生或护士的人更喜欢<i>患者</i>，而<i>患者</i>和<i>客户</i>在咨询社会工作者或职业治疗师的人中同样受欢迎。对其他术语（包括<i>服务用户</i>、<i>使用服务的人和</i><i>消费者</i>）的接受程度差异很大。简而言之，不存在单一的理想术语，而对一个理想术语的寻找却以这样的现实为基础：具有相同条件的个体通常对于他们希望被称为什么而存在差异。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/equity-language-guides-sierra-club-banned-words/673085/">摘自 2023 年 4 月号：反对公平语言的道德案例</a><br><br>讽刺的是，通过新术语促进公平的冲动在某些情况下未能考虑到个人和文化多样性。许多美国学者很快就采用了<i>“拉丁裔”</i>这个新词，作为比<i>“西班牙裔</i>”或<i>“拉丁裔”</i>更具包容性、更中性的替代词，尽管这个词让一些拉丁美洲裔人感到困惑或恼火，而且<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/hispanic/2020/08/11/about-one-in-four-u-s-hispanics-have-heard-of-latinx-but-just-3-use-it/">调查数据</a>表明很少有人用它来描述自己。其他旨在减少社会耻辱的语言的影响并不总是很明显。在美国，<i>无家可归者</i>在某些方面已经声名狼藉，但没有可靠住所的人们是否受益于或更愿意使用表面上更平等的<i>无家可归者</i>或<i>无家可归者</i>，仍有待证明。良好的意图有时会产生大量术语，这些术语很快就会分解为首字母缩略词。<i>患有酒精使用障碍的人</i>可能具有一些人性化的潜力，但是否像许多学术论文那样将这个术语缩写为<i>PWAUD</i>具有预期的效果还只是一个猜测。<br><br>谴责别人的术语有害，并要求别人采用你自己的术语，可能会令人陶醉，以至于将此类争议提交给实证检验可能会让人感觉有点沮丧。 But making these judgments in a rigorous, fact-based way would prevent experts, policy makers, and the general public from being distracted by something easy—arguing about words—when we need to focus on doing something much harder: solving massive social problems. A shared commitment to evidence provides a way to resolve upsetting disagreements that can otherwise fester forever, while opening up chances to learn when we have in fact caused harm and genuinely need to treat others better.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/addiction-drug-policy-language-harm-evidence/674907/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/addiction-drug-policy-language-harm-evidence/674907/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Here Comes the Second Year of AI College]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Universities still aren&#39;t sure whether to embrace the technology or ban it. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/4lFQlZq-m5haSSvNy5GZSNgvFeM=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/ai_college_2/original.jpg" alt="An old-school computer-generated image of a graduation cap" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Illustration by Joanne Imperio / The Atlantic</figcaption></figure> W <span class="smallcaps">hen ChatGPT entered the world</span> last fall, the faculty at SUNY Buffalo freaked out. Kelly Ahuna, the university&#39;s director of academic integrity, was inundated by panicked emails. “It has me thinking about retiring,” one English professor confessed. He had typed a prompt into ChatGPT and watched in horror as an essay unfurled on-screen. There were errors, sure: incorrect citations, weird transitions. But he would have given it a B-minus. He anticipated an onslaught of undetectable AI plagiarism. Ahuna found herself as something of a spiritual mentor, guiding faculty through their existential angst about artificial intelligence.<br><br> The first year of AI college was marked by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/chatbot-cheating-college-campuses/674073/">mayhem and mistrust</a> . Educational institutions, accustomed to moving very slowly, for the most part failed to issue clear guidance. In this vacuum, professors grew suspicious of students who turned in particularly grammatical essays. Plagiarism detectors flagged legitimate work as AI-generated. Over the summer, some universities and colleges have regrouped; they&#39;re trying to embrace AI at the institutional level, incorporating it into curriculum and helping instructors adapt. But the norm is still to let individual educators fend for themselves—and some of those individuals seem to believe that they can keep teaching as if generative AI didn&#39;t exist.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/05/chatbot-cheating-college-campuses/674073/">Read: The first year of AI college ends in ruin</a><br><br> Modernizing higher education is a formidable task. I graduated from college this past spring. Before the pandemic, my professors insisted that we print assignments out and hand them in—forget submitting online. Although ChatGPT was available for nearly my entire senior year, the university administration sent out only one announcement about it, encouraging faculty to understand the implications of the technology. My friends, meanwhile, talked incessantly about it. I don&#39;t know anyone who wrote an entire paper with ChatGPT—or who would admit to it, at least—but people used it in other ways. Some asked it to generate practice-exam questions for them to solve. Others turned to it for help with their philosophy reading, asking the chatbot to explain, say, Parfit&#39;s definition of a self-effacing theory. One of my friends asked ChatGPT how to get over her ex-boyfriend. (The advice was generic but excellent.) But only one of my professors ever mentioned it: Halfway through the spring semester, my computer-science professor announced that we couldn&#39;t use ChatGPT to complete our codes. Then he said he would rely on the honor system.<br><br> Heading into the second year of AI college, some institutions are trying to develop a less technophobic approach. According to Kathe Pelletier, a director at the tech-focused education nonprofit Educause, the most enthusiastic AI adopters tend to be public universities or community colleges that serve large, diverse student bodies and see education as a means of social mobility. Arizona State University is piloting an introductory writing course in which an AI bot offers feedback on students&#39; work. The class is taught to remote learners at a low cost, and the AI could allow for something like peer feedback for students who take classes alone, on their own schedule. Administrators at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville have organized a professor-led task force to suggest different ways for faculty to add generative AI to the classroom. The University of Florida launched a $70 million AI initiative in 2020 with funding from the chip-manufacturing giant Nvidia. Sid Dobrin, an English professor who is part of the initiative, says that it will sponsor a competition this year in which students can win prize money for the most creative use of generative text or image AI. These schools are preparing to feed employers&#39; hunger for AI-savvy graduates. “I always say: You are not going to lose your job to AI,” Dobrin told me. “You are going to lose your job to somebody who understands how to use AI.”<br><br> Other universities, however, still have no overarching institutional posture toward AI. Administrators are wary of announcing policies that could age poorly. Professors are left to figure out how to leverage the technology on their own. In its defense, this stance preserves academic autonomy and encourages experimentation. For example, the teacher of Harvard&#39;s introductory computer-science course deployed a teaching-assistant chatbot this summer built based on OpenAI&#39;s code. But the hands-off institutional approach also forces instructors, many of whom have yet to master the “Mute” button on Zoom, to be at the vanguard of a technology that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/sam-altman-openai-chatgpt-gpt-4/674764/">isn&#39;t fully understood</a> even by the people who created it. In a recent informal <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://er.educause.edu/articles/2023/4/educause-quickpoll-results-adopting-and-adapting-to-generative-ai-in-higher-ed-tech">poll</a> by Educause, 40 percent of respondents said that they weren&#39;t aware of anyone at their institution taking responsibility for decisions around how generative AI should be used. “A president or provost is thinking, <em>Should I jump on this only to have it become the most unpopular thing in the world?</em> ” Bryan Alexander, who teaches at Georgetown University&#39;s school of learning, design, and technology, says.<br><br> Some academics have been eager to add the alien technology to their classroom. Ted Underwood, who teaches English and information science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says that every student should learn the basics of AI ethics. He likens the topic to the tenets of democracy, which even people who won&#39;t pursue political science need to understand. Other professors see AI as a way to enliven instruction. The new introductory writing course at the University of Utah asks students to compare sonnets written by William Shakespeare, Pablo Neruda, and ChatGPT; professors say that using an AI bot is the easiest way to generate usefully bad poems.<br><br> Another faction within academia sees generative AI as an enemy. In the age of large language models, a student&#39;s writing assignment can no longer reliably confirm whether they&#39;ve understood a topic or read a text. Weekly reading responses and discussion posts, once a staple of higher education, seem useless. Some instructors are trying to adopt countermeasures. One SUNY Buffalo faculty member told Kelly Ahuna that he would keep his weekly online quizzes but employ technology that tracks students&#39; eye movements to detect potential cheating. Others seem to hope that prohibition alone can preserve the familiar pre-ChatGPT world. Most instructors at Bryn Mawr College have declared that any use of AI tools counts as plagiarism, says Carlee Warfield, the head of the school&#39;s honor board. Darren Hick, a philosophy professor at Furman University, told me he refuses to abandon take-home essays. In his view, in-person exams aren&#39;t real philosophy. They leave no time for rumination and serious engagement with a thinker&#39;s work. “It&#39;s gimmicky,” Hick said. “My pedagogy is good, my students learn, and I don&#39;t like the idea of having to upend what&#39;s been a tradition in philosophy for millennia because somebody has a new technology that students can use to cheat.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/12/chatgpt-ai-writing-college-student-essays/672371/">Read: The college essay is dead</a><br><br> Many of the professors and administrators I spoke with likened generative AI to earlier waves of technological change; perhaps an analogy offered perspective and solace when confronting something so mystifying. They compared it to Wikipedia (riddled with inaccuracies), to calculators (students still learn long division), and even to microwave dinners (ChatGPT&#39;s writing is a frozen meat loaf; a student essay is a marbled steak).<br><br> But the most common comparison was to the advent of the internet. Charles Isbell, the dean of computing at Georgia Tech, points out that the web did not immediately create the kind of nightmarish scenario that people had predicted. Supersonic email exchanges didn&#39;t <a data-event-element="inline link" href="http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/22/text.iq/">scramble our brains</a> , just as the “Undo” button hasn&#39;t <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/humanity-has-always-feared-technology-in-the-21st-century-are-we-right-to-be-afraid/">eroded our sense of consequence</a> . For now, Isbell isn&#39;t concerned about students cheating with AI: If they submit a ChatGPT-written essay, the errors will give them away, and if they try to avoid detection by meticulously fact-checking the chatbot&#39;s writing, they&#39;ll learn the material. But just like the internet, which spawned smartphones and social-media sites that few people could have foreseen, AI will undercut the most basic patterns in higher education. “It&#39;s perfectly reasonable to hold in your head both thoughts,” Isbell told me. “It&#39;s not going to be the big, destructive force that we think it&#39;s going to be anytime soon. Also, higher education will be completely unrecognizable in 15 years because of this technology. We just don&#39;t really know how.”<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/ai-chatgpt-college-essay-plagiarism/674928/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/ai-chatgpt-college-essay-plagiarism/674928/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Ones We Sent Away]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> I thought my mother was an only child.我错了。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vFR8IS7nzxmPuTwvFQJ8dKcRgaI=/0x0:2880x1620/1440x810/media/img/2023/08/03/Senior_Opener_NEW_2/original.png" alt="black-and-white family photo of girl standing with parents, with cut-out silhouette of missing younger child on light purple background" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Photo-illustration by Oliver Munday.

My husband wanders into the kitchen and asks whether I&#39;ve seen<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/RoseUnwin/status/1429941550881124353">the post from the English theater director</a> that has been whipping around Twitter, the one featuring a photograph of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/15/stephen-unwin-son-joey-learning-disability">his nonverbal son</a> . I have not. I head up the stairs to my computer. “How will I find it?” I shout.<br><br> “You&#39;ll find it,” he tells me.<br><br> I do, within a matter of seconds: a picture of Joey Unwin, smiling gently for the camera, his bare calves and sandaled toes a few steps from an inlet by the sea. Perhaps you, too, have seen this photo? His father, Stephen, surely did not intend it to become the sensation it did—he wasn&#39;t being political, wasn&#39;t playing to the groundlings. “Joey is 25 today,” he wrote. “He&#39;s never said a word in his life, but has taught me so much more than I&#39;ve ever taught him.”<br><br> That this earnest, heartfelt tweet has been liked some 80,000 times and retweeted more than 2,600 is already striking. But even more so is the cascade of replies: scores of photographs from parents of non- and minimally verbal children from all over the world. Some of the kids are young and some are old; some hold pets and some sit on swings; some grin broadly and some affect a more serious, thoughtful air. One is proudly holding a tray of Yorkshire pudding he&#39;s baked. Another is spooning his mom on a picnic blanket.<br><br> I spend nearly an hour, just scrolling. I am only partway through when I realize my husband hasn&#39;t steered me toward this outpouring simply because it&#39;s an atypical Twitter moment, suffused with the sincere and the personal. It&#39;s because he recognizes that to me, the tweet and downrush of replies <i>are</i> personal.<br><br> He knows that I have an aunt whom no one speaks about and who herself barely speaks. She is, at the time of this tweet, 70 years old and living in a group home in upstate New York. I have met her just once. Before this very moment, in fact, I have forgotten she exists at all.<br><br> It is extraordinary what we hide from ourselves—and even more extraordinary that we once hid her, my mother&#39;s <i>sister</i> , and so many like her from everyone. Here are all these pictures of nonverbal children, so pulsingly alive—their parents describing their pleasures, their passions, their strengths and styles and tastes—while I know nothing, absolutely nothing, of my aunt&#39;s life at all. She is a thinning shadow, an aging ghost.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">When I first discovered</span> that my mother had a younger sister, I reacted as if I&#39;d been told about the existence of a new planet. This fact at once astonished me and made an eerie kind of sense, suddenly explaining the gravitational force that had invisibly arranged my family&#39;s movements and behaviors for years. Now I understood why my grandfather spent so many hours in retirement as a volunteer at the Westchester Association for Retarded Citizens. Now I understood my grandmother&#39;s annual trips to the local department store to buy Christmas presents, although we were Jewish. (At the time, my aunt lived in a group home where the residents were taken to church every Sunday.)<br><br> I now even understood, perhaps, the flickers of melancholy I would see in my grandmother, an otherwise buoyant and intrepid personality, charming and sly and full of wit.<br><br> And my mom: Where do you start with my mom? For almost two years, she had a sister. Then, at the age of 6 and a half, she watched as her only sibling, almost five years younger, was spirited away. It would be 40 years before she saw her again.<br><br> Strange how seldom we think about who our parents were as people before we made their acquaintance—all the dynamics and influences that shaped them, the defining traumas and triumphs of their early lives. Yet how are we to know them, really, if we don&#39;t? And show them compassion and understanding as they age?<br><br> I was 12 when I learned. My mother and I were sitting at the kitchen table when I wondered aloud what I&#39;d do if I ever had a disabled child. This provided her with an opening.<br><br> <i>Her name is Adele.</i><br><br> She had red hair, I was told. Weird: Who in our family had red hair? (Actually, my great-grandmother, but I knew her only as a white-haired battle-ax dedicated in equal measure to her soap operas and cigarettes.) She is <i>profoundly retarded</i> , my mother explained. There had been no language revolution back then. This was the proper descriptor, found in textbooks and doctors&#39; charts. My mother elaborated that the bones in Adele&#39;s head had knitted together far too early when she was a baby. So, a smaller brain. It was only when I met her 16 years later that I understood the physical implications of this: a markedly smaller head.<br><br> It was staggering to meet someone who looked just like my mother, but with red hair and a much smaller head.<br><br> My grandmother told my mother that she instantly knew something was different when Adele was born. Her cry wasn&#39;t like other babies&#39;. She was inconsolable, had to be carried everywhere. Her family doctor said nonsense, Adele was fine. For an entire year, he maintained that she was fine, even though, at the age of 1, she couldn&#39;t hold a bottle and didn&#39;t respond to the stimuli that other toddlers do. I can&#39;t imagine what this casual brush-off must have done to my grandmother, who knew, in some back cavern of her heart, that her daughter was not the same as other children. But it was 1952, the summer that Adele turned 1. What male doctor took a working-class woman without a college education seriously in 1952?<br><br> Only when my mother and her family went to the Catskills that same summer did a doctor finally offer a very different diagnosis. My grandmother had gone to see this local fellow not because Adele was sick, but because <i>she</i> was; Adele had merely come along. But whatever ailed my grandmother didn&#39;t capture this man&#39;s attention. Her daughter did. He took one look at her and demanded to know whether my aunt was getting the care she required.<br><br> What did he mean?<br><br> “That child is a microcephalic idiot.”<br><br> My grandmother told this story to my mother, word for word, more than four decades later.<br><br> In March of 1953, my grandparents took Adele, all of 21 months, to Willowbrook State School. It would be many years before I learned exactly what that name meant, years before I learned what kind of gothic mansion of horrors it was. And my mother, who didn&#39;t know how to explain what on earth had happened, began telling people that she was an only child.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is the fall</span> of 2021. My aunt lives in a uniquely unlovely part of upstate New York, a dreary grayscape of strip malls and Pizza Huts and liquor stores. But her group home is a snuggery of overstuffed furniture, flowers, family photos; the outside is framed by an actual white picket fence. It is precisely the kind of home you would hope that your aunt, abandoned to an institution through a cruel accident of timing and gravely misplaced ideas, would find herself in as she ages. When my mother and I arrive to see her, she is waiting for us at the door.<br><br> The drive to this house was 90 minutes from where my folks live in northern Westchester. Yet the car ride yielded just 29 minutes and 15 seconds of recorded conversation with my mother. This could partly be explained by the unfamiliar directions in her GPS, but still: Here she was, visiting the sister she hadn&#39;t seen since 1998—and then only twice before that, in 1993, shortly after her father died—and she had almost nothing to say about where we were headed or what the weather was like inside her head. She seemed far more interested in telling me about the necklaces she was making and selling to support Hadassah, one of her favorite charities. Whether this was out of anxiety or enthusiasm, I didn&#39;t know.<br><br> “Are you feeling nervous about seeing her?” I finally asked.<br><br> “No.”<br><br> “Really?为什么不？ <i>I&#39;m</i> nervous.”<br><br> “Why are you nervous?”<br><br> “Why are you <i>not</i> nervous?”<br><br> “Because I made peace with my separation from her many, many years ago.”<br><br> My grandparents, for their part, had visited my aunt almost every week, at least when she was young. Even after my grandmother moved to Florida, she made an effort to visit once a year. When I was in my late teens or early 20s, I remember my mother telling me that Adele never knew or understood who my grandmother was, not ever. This fact stuck with me—and hit me especially hard when I became a mother myself. As we were humming along the Taconic State Parkway, I reconfirmed: Adele didn&#39;t recognize her own mother?<br><br> “No,” she said. “She didn&#39;t know her. She didn&#39;t understand the concept of a mother.”<br><br> But when my mother last saw her sister, in 1998, it wasn&#39;t my grandmother who accompanied her. It was me. The whole trip had been at my instigation, just like this one. I&#39;d mentioned that I was interested in meeting my aunt, and my mother had stunned me then, just as she&#39;d stunned me now, by saying, “Why don&#39;t we go together?”<br><br> And what do I remember of that singular day? How uncharacteristically animated and affectionate my mother was when she saw Adele, for one thing. You could almost discern the outlines of the little girl she&#39;d been, the one who would circle Adele&#39;s crib and play a made-up game she called “Here, Baby.” Also, how petite my aunt was—4 foot 8, dumpling-shaped—and how slack the musculature was around her jaw, which may have had something to do with the fact that my aunt had no teeth. She had supposedly taken a medication that had made them decay, though there&#39;s really no way to know.<br><br> But what stayed with me most from that day—what I thought about for years afterward—were the needlepoint canvases marching along the walls in Adele&#39;s bedroom. My mother and I both gasped when we saw them. My mother, too, was an avid needlepointer in those years, undertaking almost comically ambitious projects—the Chagall windows, the Unicorn Tapestries. Adele&#39;s handiwork was simpler, cruder, but there it was, betokening the same passion, the same obsession.<br><br> One other thing: My mother and I discovered that day that Adele could carry a tune—and when she sang, she suddenly had hundreds of words at her disposal, not just <i>yes</i> and <i>no</i> , the only two words we heard her speak. Again, we were amazed. For years, my mother was a pianist and studied opera; her technical skills were impeccable, her sight-reading was impeccable, her ear was impeccable. She could pick up the telephone and tell you that the dial tone was a major third.<br><br> My mother couldn&#39;t get over it—the needlepoints, the singing.<br><br> I felt like I was staring at some kind of photonegative of a twin study.<br><br> So here we are, 23 years later, and Adele is greeting us at the door. She is wearing a bright-red sweater. There is my mother at the door. She, too, is wearing a bright-red sweater. Adele is wearing a long, chunky beaded necklace she has recently made at her day program. And my mother, like her sister, is wearing a long, chunky beaded necklace she has recently made—not at a day program, obviously, but for Hadassah. It turns out that Adele loves making necklaces and has whole drawers of them. As, lately, does my mother.<br><br> I have a picture of the two of them standing side by side that day. I cannot stop looking at it.<br><br> Carmen Ayala, Adele&#39;s extraordinary 79-year-old caretaker, has instructed Adele to say “Hello, Rona, I love you” to my mother, a gesture that&#39;s both sweet and awkward—Adele doesn&#39;t know my mother by sight, much less by name. Still, it catches my mother by surprise, not least because it suggests that her sister&#39;s vocabulary has expanded considerably since we last saw her, when she was living in a different group home. They embrace and take seats on the couch in the living room. We try, for a time, to ask Adele basic questions about her day, without much success, though when we ask if she knows any Christmas carols—the holiday is coming up—she sings “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” for us, and my mother replies in kind with “Silent Night.” Then Adele zones out, staring at her hands. She can spend hours staring at her hands.<br><br> My mother and I start to ask Carmen and her youngest child, Evelyn—she lives nearby and knows well all three residents in her parents&#39; home—the customary questions: How did Carmen get into this line of work? What is Adele&#39;s routine? How did Adele handle the transition to Carmen&#39;s house 22 years ago, after her previous caretaker retired? And although I&#39;m interested in the answers, I find myself growing restless, thoughts of that Twitter thread plucking at my consciousness. I finally blurt out: What is my aunt <i>like</i> ?<br><br> Evelyn replies first. “Very meticulous,” she says. “She needs things a certain way, and she will correct you the minute you do something wrong.”<br><br> I stare at my mother, who says nothing. I turn back to Evelyn and Carmen and prompt them. Such as?<br><br> Her clothes have to match, they say, down to the underwear. She keeps her bed pin-neat.<br><br> “She knows where everything is at,” Evelyn continues. “If we”—meaning her or any of her family members—“come here and we are washing a dish and we put it in the wrong place, she will tell us, <i>Nope</i> .”<br><br> I stare at my mother expectantly.依然没有。<br><br> “Like, <i>That doesn&#39;t go there</i> ,” Evelyn explains.<br><br> At this point, my mother pipes up. “I don&#39;t let anyone else load the dishwasher.”<br><br> Finally.<br><br> “That&#39;s Adele,” Evelyn says.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Arthur Miller&#39;s youngest son</span> , Daniel, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2007/09/miller200709">was institutionalized</a> . He was born with Down syndrome in 1966 and sent to Southbury Training School, in Connecticut, when he was about 4 years old. Miller never once mentioned him in his memoir <i>Timebends</i> , and Miller&#39;s <i>New York Times</i> obituary said not one word about him, naming three children, rather than four.<br><br> Erik Erikson, the storied developmental psychologist, also <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/99/08/22/reviews/990822.22edmundt.html">put his son with Down syndrome in an institution</a> . He and his wife, Joan, told their other three children that their brother died shortly after he was born in 1944. They eventually told all three the truth, but not at the same time. Their oldest son learned first. That must have been quite a secret to keep.<br><br> It is astonishing how many Americans have relations who were, at some point during the past century, sequestered from public view. They were warehoused, disappeared, roughly shorn from the family tree.<br><br> Pearl S. Buck, the Nobel Prize winner for literature and author of <i>The Good Earth</i> , institutionalized her 9-year-old daughter, Carol, likely in 1929. But Buck was different: She regularly visited her daughter, and 21 years later had the courage to write about her experience in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-child-who-never-grew-a-memoir-pearl-s-buck/9781504047968?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Child Who Never Grew</i></a> .<br><br> It is remarkable how many Americans have relations who were, at some point during the past century, sequestered from public view. They were warehoused, disappeared, roughly shorn from the family tree. “Delineated” is how the Georgetown disability-studies scholar Jennifer Natalya Fink puts it, meaning denied their proper place in their ancestral lineage.<br><br> With time, we would learn the terrible toll that institutionalization took on those individuals. But they weren&#39;t the only ones who paid a price, Fink argues. So did their parents, their siblings, future generations. In hiding our disabled relations, she writes in her book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/all-our-families-disability-lineage-and-the-future-of-kinship-jennifer-natalya-fink/9780807008133?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>All Our Families</i></a> , we as a culture came to view disability “as an individual trauma to a singular family, rather than a common, collective, and normal experience of all families.”<br><br> This is precisely what happened to Fink. When her daughter was diagnosed with autism at 2 and a half, Fink was devastated, despite her liberal politics and enlightened attitude toward neurodiversity. Then she realized that the only disabled person she knew about in her family was a relative who&#39;d been institutionalized in the early &#39;70s. This sent her on a journey to learn more about him—and in so doing, she discovered yet another disabled family member, in Scotland. Had she known far more about them—had they been an integral part of family discussions and photo albums (and, in the case of the American relative, family events)—she would have had a far richer, more expansive understanding of her ancestry; her own child&#39;s disability would have seemed like “part of the warp and woof of our lineage,” as she writes, rather than an exception.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/10/autisms-first-child/308227/">From the October 2010 issue: Autism&#39;s first child</a><br><br> It occurred to me that this may have been one of my unconscious motives in trying to get to know Adele at such a late stage of my own life, in addition to simple curiosity about a lost relative. It would be a minor act of restitution, of relineation. Without any malevolent intent, we&#39;d all colluded in one woman&#39;s erasure. And our entire family had been the poorer for it.<br><br> Mass institutionalization wasn&#39;t always the norm in the United States. During the colonial era, people with developmental and intellectual disabilities were integrated into most communities; in the early 1800s, with the advent of asylums and special schools, American educators hoped some could be cured and quickly returned to mainstream society.<br><br> But by the late 19th century, it became clear that intellectual disabilities couldn&#39;t be vanquished simply by sending people to the right schools or asylums, and once the eugenics movement captured the public&#39;s imagination, the fate of the country&#39;s intellectually and developmentally disabled was sealed. “Undesirables” and “defectives” weren&#39;t just institutionalized; they became the involuntary subjects of medical experiments, waking from mysterious surgeries to discover that they could no longer have children.<br><br> Cue the line from <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1900-1940/274us200"><i>Buck v. Bell</i> , the infamous 1927 Supreme Court case</a> that upheld a Virginia statute permitting the sterilization of the so-called intellectually unfit: “Three generations of imbeciles are enough.”<br><br> Then the postwar era came along, with its apron-clad mothers and gray-flanneled fathers and all-around emphasis on a certain species of Americanness, a certain norm. “I&#39;m speaking in huge generalities here,” says Kim E. Nielsen, the author of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/a-disability-history-of-the-united-states-kim-e-nielsen/9780807022047?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>A Disability History of the United States</i></a> , “but I think that push for social conformity exacerbated the incredible shame folks had about family members with intellectual and physical disabilities.” Institutionalizing such family members often became the most attractive—or viable—option. The stigma associated with having a different sort of child was too great; too often, schools wouldn&#39;t have them, state-subsidized therapies weren&#39;t available to them, and churches wouldn&#39;t come to their aid. “There were no support structures at all,” Nielsen told me. “It was almost the opposite. There were <i>anti</i> -support structures.”<br><br> My aunt was born in that postwar period. But I don&#39;t think my grandparents were capitulating to social pressure when they institutionalized Adele. They were simply listening to the advice of their doctors, authoritative men with white coats and granite faces who told them there was no point in keeping their daughter at home. According to my mother, my grandparents ferried Adele from one specialist to another, each declaring that she would never walk, never talk, never outgrow her diapers.<br><br> Which raised a question, on further reflection: Did my aunt&#39;s condition have a name? As we were driving along, my mother told me she didn&#39;t know; Adele had never had genetic testing.<br><br>真的吗？ I asked. Even now? In the 2020s?<br><br>真的。<br><br> My grandparents are no longer with us. I know little of what they were told or how they felt when they were advised to send their second child away. But I imagine the script sounded similar to what a physician told Pearl S. Buck when she took Carol to the Mayo Clinic. “This child will be a burden on you all your life,” he said, according to Buck&#39;s memoir. “Do not let her absorb you. Find a place where she can be happy and leave her there and live your own life.” She did as she was told. But it violated every ounce of her maternal intuition. “Perhaps the best way to put it,” she wrote, “is that I felt as though I were bleeding inwardly and desperately.”<br><br> “The parents who institutionalized their children—they too are survivors of institutionalization and victims of it,” Fink told me. “They were broken by this. It was not presented as a choice, for the most part. And even when it was, the medical establishment made it seem like institutionalization was the <i>best</i> choice.”<br><br> That applied to my grandmother, a tower of resilience, a woman who survived her father&#39;s suicide, a brutal knife attack by a madman in a public restroom, and breast cancer at a relatively young age. She, like Buck, bled inwardly and desperately, in the most literal sense, developing an ulcer when my mom was 11 or 12. “Before Grandma died, she started talking about Adele, and for the first time that I can remember, she admitted that she felt terrible institutionalizing her,” my mother told me as we drove. “When I reminded her that if she had not institutionalized her, nobody in the family would&#39;ve had a normal life, she said, &#39;Yes, but she would&#39;ve been with people who loved her.&#39; ”<br><br> One of the beneficiaries of that so-called normal life was, ostensibly, my mother. In his magisterial <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/far-from-the-tree-parents-children-and-the-search-for-identity-andrew-solomon/9780743236720?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Far From the Tree</i></a> , the writer Andrew Solomon notes that the most commonly cited rationale for institutionalization in those years was that neurotypical siblings would suffer—from shame, from attention starvation—if their disabled siblings were kept at home.<br><br> But it&#39;s more complicated than that, isn&#39;t it? My mother has never in her life uttered a cross word about her parents&#39; decision, and she&#39;s hardly the sort to play the victim—she may have been trained as an opera singer, but she&#39;s the least divalike person I know. Yet when I asked her what it was like when Adele left the house, she reflexively confirmed Fink&#39;s hypothesis: She suffered. “It was like I lost an arm or a leg,” she said.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/phantom-twin/">his second memoir,</a></span> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/phantom-twin/"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://archive.nytimes.com/tmagazine.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/phantom-twin/"><i>Twin</i></a> , the composer and pianist Allen Shawn writes about the trauma of losing his twin sister, Mary, to an institution when they were 8 years old. He describes her absence as “an unmourned death,” which closely matches my mother&#39;s experience; he writes, too, that when she was sent away, it felt to him like a form of punishment, “an expulsion, an exile,” which my mother has also recounted in melancholy detail.<br><br> But what most captured my attention was Shawn&#39;s analysis of how his sister affected his personality. “From an early age,” he writes, “I intuited that there were tensions surrounding Mary and instinctively took it upon myself to continue to be the easier child and avoid worrying my parents.”<br><br> That was my mother: the peerless good girl. High-achieving, rule-abiding, perfection-seeking. She skipped a grade. Until junior high, she chose practicing piano over playing with friends. In high school, she sang with the all-city chorus at Carnegie Hall.<br><br> Did she ever rebel? I asked her.<br><br> “Nah,” she said. “I was a goody-goody.”<br><br> To this day, my mother is the good girl. Buttoned-up, always reasonable, always in control. When hotter tempers flare around her, she defaults to a cool 66 degrees.<br><br> My mother was thrilled when her parents brought her newborn sister home. She remembers Adele scooching to different corners of her playpen to follow her as she ran in circles around it. She remembers sitting on the kitchen counter and watching my grandmother prepare bottles. She remembers my grandmother asking her to go on tiptoe into my grandparents&#39; room to see if Adele was asleep in her crib or still fussing. When my grandmother and grandfather began their frantic circuit of New York City&#39;s specialists, wondering what could be done to help Adele, my mother had no clue that anything was the matter. Why would she? She was 6 years old. She&#39;d always wanted a sibling and now she&#39;d been gifted one. Adele was marvelous. Adele was perfect. Adele was her sister.<br><br> When my grandparents left to take Adele to Willowbrook in March of 1953, they had no idea what to tell my mother, settling eventually on the story that they were taking her sister to “walking school.” My mom thought little of it. But for weeks, months, years, she kept expecting Adele to return. <i>When is she coming back?</i> she would regularly ask. <i>We don&#39;t know</i> , my grandparents would reply.<br><br> At 8, my mother one day had a sudden meltdown—became unstrung, hysterical—and demanded much more loudly to know when Adele would be returning, pointing out that it was taking her an awfully long time to learn how to walk. That was the first time she saw my grandmother cry.<br><br> <i>I don&#39;t know</i> , she still answered.<br><br> That same year, my great-grandmother, recently widowed, moved in with my grandparents. More specifically, she moved into my mother&#39;s room, into the twin bed that Adele was supposed to occupy. My mother was furious about having to move her things, furious that she was losing her privacy, furious that her grandmother was moving into Adele&#39;s bed. (Now she modified the question she regularly asked her parents: <i>Where will Adele sleep when she comes home?</i> And they would always reply: <i>We&#39;ll figure it out when the time comes.</i> ) Adele never did come home, and my grandparents would never try to have another child to fill that bed. My great-grandmother was there to stay.<br><br> My great-grandmother: Lord. She meant well, I suppose. But she had only a grade-school education and all the subtlety of a flyswatter. When my mother was 13, my great-grandmother told her that she had to be good enough for two children, smart enough for two children. “She kept emphasizing that my parents had lost a child,” my mother said. The pressure was awful.<br><br> By 13, of course, my mother had already figured out that something was different about her sister—and that Adele was never coming home. She&#39;d heard the neighborhood kids whisper. One cruelly declared she&#39;d heard Adele was in reform school. Consciously or unconsciously, my mother began handling the situation in her own way, volunteering in classrooms for kids with intellectual disabilities. Two liked her so much that she started tutoring them privately.<br><br> Yet throughout my mother&#39;s childhood, my grandparents never once invited her to come with them to visit Adele. At first she was told no children were allowed; by the time her parents did ask her to join them, my mother, at that point an adult with children of her own, said no. She felt too raw, too tender about it. She didn&#39;t want to unloose a current of ancient hurts. My grandparents never raised it again.<br><br> I asked if she ever sat around and just thought about Adele. “Oh, sure,” she told me. “I wonder what she would&#39;ve been like if she weren&#39;t disabled. I wonder what kind of relationship we would&#39;ve had. I wonder whether I would&#39;ve had nieces and nephews. Whether she would&#39;ve had a husband, whether she would&#39;ve had a good marriage, whether we would&#39;ve been close, whether we would&#39;ve lived near each other …”<br><br> And what ran through her mind, I asked, when she set eyes on Adele for the first time in 40 years, back in 1993? “I got deprived of having a real sibling,” she said.<br><br> For weeks afterward, I thought long and hard about this particular regret. Because my aunt <i>was</i> a real sibling. But no one of my mother&#39;s generation was told to think this way. The disabled were dramatically underestimated and therefore criminally undercultivated: hidden in institutions, treated interchangeably, decanted of all humanity—spectral figures at best, relegated to the margins of society and memory. Even their closest family members were trained to forget them. After my mother came home from that visit, she scribbled six pages of impressions titled “I Have a Sister.” As if she were finally allowing it to register. To acknowledge this clandestine part of herself.<br><br> It is painful, almost too painful, to think about how differently my mother might have felt—how different her life and my aunt&#39;s might have been—if they had been born today.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s June of 2022.</span> I&#39;ve just asked Adele how many pictures are sitting in front of me. My mother is skeptical. I ask again. “How many pictures? One …”<br><br> “One,” she repeats.<br><br> “Two …” I say.<br><br> “Two, three,” she finishes.<br><br> I look triumphantly at my mother.<br><br> My mother is now somewhere between skeptical and delighted. She tries herself. “How many fingers?” she asks, holding up her hand.<br><br> “Five.”<br><br> There are five.<br><br> “She understands,” I tell my mother.<br><br> “Well, either that or she memorized it.”<br><br> I show Adele two fingers and ask how many.<br><br> “Two.”<br><br> There&#39;s a reason my mother is surprised. When we visited Adele in 1998, she barely spoke at all, much less showed that she had a notional sense of quantity. (She will today show us that she can count to 12 before she starts skipping around.) She wasn&#39;t agitated back then when we saw her, not exactly. But she wasn&#39;t relaxed. A transfixing report about Adele, sent to my mother not that long ago, suggests that one of the reasons she may be more alert now—and possesses a larger vocabulary—is because she&#39;s on a better, less sedating regimen of medications.<br><br> But there&#39;s another reason, I think, for my mother&#39;s skepticism. Her whole life, she&#39;d been given to understand that Adele&#39;s condition was fixed—that her sister was consigned to a life without any deepening or growth. As she put it to me during that first car ride: “There would be no reason for her to get any more cognizant or any smarter.” That&#39;s how everyone thought about disability back in my mother&#39;s day. It&#39;s my own generation—and the ones following—that came to see the brain as a miracle of plasticity, teachable and retrainable right into old age.<br><br> Yet Adele exceeded the expectations of all the specialists who gave dire predictions to my grandparents. She did learn to talk. She did become toilet-trained. Not only can she walk, but she dances a mean salsa, which she shows us now—and where she gets her sense of rhythm, I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s great. (I personally dance like Elaine on <i>Seinfeld</i> .) Carmen and her husband, Juan, both from Puerto Rico, often play Latin music, and Adele jumps right in, with one hand on her belly and the other high and outward-facing, as if on the shoulder of an imaginary partner, all while shaking her hips and waggling her rear. Juan, whom she calls “Daddy,” often joins her.<br><br> Adele gently rests her head on my mother&#39;s shoulder and keeps it there. My mother, ordinarily a coil of discipline, looks so blissed out, so happy.<br><br> I ask Carmen (whom she calls “Mommy”) whether Adele knows any Spanish, given that she and Juan speak it around the house. She says yes.<br><br> “ <i>¡Mamá!</i> ” Carmen calls to Adele.<br><br> “什么？”<br><br> “ <i>¿Tú quieres a papi?</i> ” Do you love Daddy?<br><br> “什么？”<br><br> “ <i>¿Tú quieres mucho a papi?</i> ” Do you love Daddy a lot?<br><br> Adele nods emphatically.<br><br> “How much?” Carmen asks, switching to English. “How much you love Daddy? Let me see how much.”<br><br> “Four dollars.”<br><br> “Four dollars!” Carmen exclaims. “Oh my God.” Juan cracks up.<br><br> This kind of confusion is also typical of what we see in Adele throughout this, our second visit to the Ayala home. The report sent to my mother, which contains assessments of the institutions she&#39;s inhabited and the day programs she&#39;s attended throughout her life, continually notes that she has trouble grasping concepts—that she “can name various objects, but become[s] confused when long sentences are used.” It adds that she “often mumbles and is difficult to understand. If she does not understand what is being said to her, she simply says, &#39;Yeah.&#39; ”<br><br> And we do have a hard time understanding her, and she does say “Yeah” to a number of our basic questions about her day, which can make getting to know her frustrating. But not when she becomes animated about things she likes. Summer is approaching, for instance, which means Adele will shortly be going to camp. She adores camp. I ask what she does there. “A game! And color.” Coloring, she means.<br><br> Other things Adele loves: <i>Care Bears</i> , stuffed animals, blingy baseball hats, shopping at Walmart, wearing perfume, preparing Juan&#39;s nightclothes, tucking in her roommate each night.<br><br> Camp is the only time Carmen truly gets a break from caring for Adele and her two housemates—“I don&#39;t like to leave them with nobody,” she explains to me—and even when she does go out, she generally doesn&#39;t travel very far.<br><br> I stare at Carmen, now 80, and realize I already live in fear of the moment when she won&#39;t be able to look after my aunt anymore. She has pulmonary hypertension and requires oxygen every night, and sometimes during the day. Yet she still cares for her three charges, whose pictures populate her photo albums right alongside those of her biological kids and grandkids. (My favorite: Adele standing next to a life-size Angry Bird.) Every day, she helps bathe them; makes their beds; shops for them; manages their various doctor appointments; takes them on outings; and, with Juan, prepares their breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Five out of seven days, this means rising at 5 am In my aunt&#39;s specific case, it means doing her hair each morning just the way she likes, putting in her earrings, and pureeing her food—Adele refuses to wear her dentures.<br><br> “When I was raising my kids, you know—it&#39;s something that you miss,” Carmen explains.<br><br> Adele&#39;s transition to the Ayala home wasn&#39;t easy. Change is hard for her; she likes order. And when she arrived at Carmen&#39;s house 23 years ago, she had scabies, which—in addition to raising questions about how well cared for she&#39;d been in her previous home—meant that Carmen had to throw out everything she owned: her beloved stuffed animals, her clothes, her sheets. The adjustment became that much more traumatic; now my aunt truly had nothing. She threw tantrums. She once called Carmen “the B-word” (as Carmen puts it). Carmen phoned the home liaison. “And she says, &#39;Carmen, easy. She&#39;s a very good lady.&#39; ”<br><br> I ask how she earned my aunt&#39;s trust. “I used to sit down with her and, you know, I used to talk to her a lot,” she says. “Talking, talking, talking to her. I&#39;m telling her, &#39;Come here, help me with this&#39; or &#39;Help me with that.&#39; ”<br><br> Now, Carmen says, Adele can recite all of her grandchildren&#39;s names and knows them by sight. She demonstrates, asking Adele to name everyone in her son Edgar&#39;s family. “JJ, Lucas, Janet, Jessica …” Adele says. Neither of her housemates can do this. “It doesn&#39;t matter how long she hasn&#39;t seen them,” Evelyn, Carmen&#39;s daughter, later tells me. “She knows who they are. She has a memory that she&#39;ll meet somebody and she&#39;ll remember their name. That&#39;s her gift.”<br><br> Her gift? I am incredulous when I hear this. I keep thinking about what I&#39;ve been told my whole adult life: that Adele never even recognized her own mother, at least as far as my mom understood it. Was this some kind of misapprehension? Maybe Adele <i>had</i> known my grandmother? Or maybe she hadn&#39;t, but only because she&#39;d been so aggressively narcotized?<br><br> As Carmen is talking with us, Adele gently rests her head on my mother&#39;s shoulder and keeps it there. My mother, ordinarily a coil of discipline and control (always correct, always the good girl), looks so blissed out, so happy. When our visit is over, she tells me that this was her favorite part, Adele burrowing into her—and that she&#39;s already thinking about when she can next see her again.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">November 22, 1977:</span> <i>On medication due to head banging behaviors … She stares off into space, fixates on her hands, or hair and has the compulsion to smell people&#39;s hair</i> (Wassaic State School, Amenia, New York).<br><br> This is from the report sent to my mother, the one containing assessments of Adele from the different institutions she&#39;s lived in and day programs she&#39;s been a part of. I had a closer look at it maybe a week or two after our second visit.<br><br> February 11, 1986: <i>(Psychotropic) Meds originally prescribed for screaming, hitting others, hitting self, extreme irritability</i> (case-worker report from a day-treatment program, Ulster County, New York). It is noted that she is taking 150 milligrams daily of Mellaril, a first-generation antipsychotic.<br><br> October 1991: <i>Outbursts look like psychosis … yell[s] out statements such as “Adele. Stop that!” or … “Leave me alone!”</i> (summary of a report from a day program, Kingston, New York).<br><br> Late 2006: <i>Psychiatry providers now recognize that there is psychosis present and Zyprexa is effectively treating this</i> (summary of various evaluations).<br><br> The report is eight pages long. But you get the idea. The dear woman who nestled into my mother&#39;s shoulder, waved at us until our car pulled out of sight, and recently wandered into Carmen&#39;s room when she intuited that something was the matter (Carmen was unwell) also had an unremitting history, until not that long ago, of violent outbursts, self-harm, and psychosis.<br><br> Far be it from me to quarrel with those who evaluated her, including the esteemed men in white coats. But “psychosis” seemed, when I read this report, like an incomplete story, carrying with it the stench of laziness and <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#39;s Nest</i> reductivism— <i>This person is difficult; let&#39;s sedate her</i> .<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/autism-first-diagnosis-donald-triplett/674453/">John Donvan and Caren Zucker: What we learned from autism&#39;s first child</a><br><br> I could have been totally wrong. Based on this report, Adele certainly seemed, at times, to pose a danger to herself and others. But I found it curious that nowhere in this document did it say anything about a behavior that even my untrained eye detected immediately during our visits: My aunt does tons of harmless stimming, the repetitive motions frequently associated with autism. (She is especially fond of wiggling her fingers in front of her eyes.) In all the years of observational data about her—at least from what I saw here—there wasn&#39;t a word about this, or the word <i>autism</i> itself. And autistic individuals, when frustrated or confronted with change or responding to excessive stimuli, can sometimes behave aggressively—or in ways that could be misread as psychotic.<br><br> And so, for that matter, can traumatized people.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is December of 2022</span> . A visiting nurse, Emane, whom Adele calls Batman, is swabbing Adele&#39;s cheek. My aunt is being sweet and obedient; Emane, tender yet efficient. The sample will go to a lab in Marshfield, Wisconsin, that will sequence Adele&#39;s genes.<br><br> Wendy Chung, the Boston Children&#39;s Hospital geneticist with whom my mother and I are working, has warned us that there is only a one-in-three chance that Adele&#39;s genetic test will come back with a condition or syndrome that has an actual name. But Chung has told me, as have a number of other experts, that there&#39;s no other way to know for sure what Adele has. Dozens of things can cause microcephaly.<br><br> “But if you can find out exactly what she has,” Chung says, “then you can find a family—”<br><br> “—with a child who has it now,” I say.<br><br> Exactly, she says. And then I can compare how children with this syndrome fare today, versus how they fared in the 1950s.<br><br> My mother, Adele&#39;s medical proxy, had to sign the forms to do this genetic test. My aunt was incapable of giving her own consent. And it occurs to me, as I sit here watching her so docilely allow Emane to rake her cheek with a Q-tip, that Adele has never been able to give her consent for anything, good or bad, her whole life. Not for the medications she has taken, which may or may not have helped her; not for mammograms, which, given our family history, are indisputably a good idea. Not for any of the things that were done to her while she was institutionalized until the age of 28; not for a trip to the mall to get ice cream.<br><br> She cannot consent to this profile, I suddenly realize with some alarm.<br><br> I spend quite a few weeks fretting about this. Only after speaking with Rosemarie Garland-Thomson, a renowned bioethicist and disability scholar, do I understand exactly why this is so. The last thing I want to do is hurt Adele. So <i>not</i> writing about her would be consistent with this wish, in keeping with the benevolent spirit of the Hippocratic oath: I&#39;d be doing no harm. Whereas I am trying to do good, a much riskier proposition. “The problem with trying to do good,” she tells me, “is you don&#39;t know how it&#39;s going to come out.”<br><br> “I don&#39;t have a <i>legal</i> right to know anything about my relatives who were disappeared,” says Jennifer Natalya Fink, who faced a similar ethical predicament when she wrote <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/all-our-families-disability-lineage-and-the-future-of-kinship-jennifer-natalya-fink/9780807008133?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>All Our Families</i></a> . “But I have a <i>moral</i> right. And it&#39;s a moral wrong, what was done to them. For us not to keep perpetuating those wrongs, we have to integrate knowledge of our disabled forebears.”<br><br> There remains a school of thought that privileges the privacy of people with intellectual disabilities above all else, particularly when it comes to something as delicate as divulging their medical history. And this argument may be right.我不知道。 But I ultimately decide, in the weeks after that swab, that integrating Adele means saying her name, and that understanding Adele—and her needs, and her potential, and whether she&#39;s been treated with the appropriate care and dignity her whole life—means knowing and naming whatever syndrome she has. To refrain from doing so would simply mean more erasure. Worse: It would imply that her condition is shameful, and there&#39;s been more than enough of that in my family.<br><br> To hell with shame.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">I don&#39;t know</span> why this is, but I keep coming back to my mother&#39;s deep desire for order. I had always assumed, I suppose, that it was a response to early trauma—a natural reaction to helplessly watching her sister get shipped away. But then I spent time with Adele and discovered that she shared the same trait, as if it were inscribed in the family genes.<br><br> I mention this one day to Evelyn, Carmen&#39;s daughter, on the phone. She mulls it over. “But maybe it comes from the same place in Adele,” she says. “She was taken from her mother. She&#39;s been controlled <i>her whole life</i> . You don&#39;t know what she&#39;s gone through, where she&#39;s been.”<br><br> I sit in chastened silence for several seconds. She is absolutely right. Of course it could come from the same place. Adele no doubt also experienced savage trauma in her life. It was just less legible, because she had no clear way to convey it. For all I know, my aunt is a <i>matryoshka</i> doll of buried pain.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In January of 1972,</span> Michael Wilkins met in a Staten Island diner with a young television journalist named Geraldo Rivera and discreetly handed him a key. It opened the doors to Building No. 6 at Willowbrook State School, from which Wilkins, a doctor, had recently been fired. He&#39;d been encouraging the parents of the children in that ward—and others, from the sound of it—to organize for better living conditions. The administration didn&#39;t like that very much.<br><br> In February of that year, Rivera&#39;s half-hour exposé, “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abc7ny.com/willowbrook-geraldo-rivera-staten-island-bill-ritter/11575075/">Willowbrook: The Last Great Disgrace</a> ,” aired on WABC-TV. It was sickening. To this day, it remains one of the most powerful testaments to the horrors and moral degeneracy of institutionalization. You can easily find it on YouTube.<br><br> Rivera was by no means the first to visit Willowbrook. Robert F. Kennedy had toured the place in 1965 and called it “a snake pit.” But because Rivera suddenly had access to one of the ghastliest dorms on campus, he and his camera crew could storm the premises unannounced. What he found—and what his viewers saw—was the kind of suffering one associates with early-Renaissance depictions of hell. The room was dark and bare. The children were naked, wailing, and rocking on the floor. Some were caked in their own feces. “How can I tell you about the way it smelled?” Rivera asked. “It smelled of filth, it smelled of disease, and it smelled of death.” He went on to interview Wilkins, who made it clear that Willowbrook wasn&#39;t a “school” at all. “Their life is just hours and hours of endless nothing to do,” he said of the patients, adding that 100 percent of them contracted hepatitis within the first six months of moving in.<br><br> Actually, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leahrosenbaum/2020/06/12/willowbrook-scandal-hepatitis-experiments-hideous-truths-of-testing-vaccines-on-humans/?sh=23070f41279c">doctors were deliberately giving some of those children hepatitis</a> . Even into the 1970s, the intellectually disabled were the subjects of government-funded medical experiments.<br><br> “Trauma is severe,” Wilkins told Rivera, “because these patients are left together on a ward—70 retarded people, basically unattended, fighting for a small scrap of paper on the floor to play with, fighting for the attention of the attendants.”<br><br> “Can the children be trained?” Rivera asked at one point.<br><br> “Yes,” the doctor said. “Every child can be trained. There&#39;s no effort. We don&#39;t know what these kids are capable of doing.”<br><br> This was where my aunt spent the formative period of her youth, from the time she was a toddler until she was 12 or 13 years old. Though she left eight years before Rivera and his crew arrived, it&#39;s hard to imagine that the conditions were any better in her day. As Kim E. Nielsen writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/a-disability-history-of-the-united-states-kim-e-nielsen/9780807022047?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>A Disability History of the United States</i></a> , World War II was devastating for these institutions, which were hardly exemplary to begin with. The young men who worked there were shipped off to war, and most of the other employees found better-paying jobs and superior conditions in defense plants. These state facilities remained dreadfully poor-paying and understaffed from then on, their budgets forever in governors&#39; crosshairs.<br><br> “It was horrible,” Diana McCourt told me. She placed her daughter, Nina, born with severe autism, in Willowbrook in 1971. “She always smelled of urine. Everything smelled of urine. It&#39;s like it was in the bricks and mortar.”<br><br> Diana and her husband, Malachy McCourt—the memoirist, actor, radio host, and famous New York pub owner—soon became outspoken activists and got involved in a class-action lawsuit against the institution. “I can&#39;t quite tell you how much they didn&#39;t want us to witness what was going on inside,” Malachy told me. When children were presented to their parents, they were taken to the entranceway of their dorm after being hastily dressed by attendants. “The clothes were never her clothes,” Diana said. “She was wearing whatever they could find in the pile.”<br><br> But most chilling of all was an offhand comment Diana made about the reports she received about her daughter. They were vague, she said, or demonstrably untrue, or maddeningly pedestrian—that she&#39;d just gone to see the dentist, for instance. “The dentist,” Diana said, “was notorious for pulling people&#39;s teeth.”<br><br> Wait, I said. Repeat that?<br><br> “Instead of dental care, they pulled the teeth out.”<br><br> Is <i>that</i> how my aunt lost her teeth?<br><br> Rivera noted in his special that the wards contained no toothbrushes that he could see.<br><br> I&#39;d like to think that Adele&#39;s life improved when she went to Wassaic State School in 1964. But New York produced, at that moment in time, nothing but hellholes. (Rivera also visited Letchworth Village in his documentary, an institution so awful that the McCourts steered clear of it, opting for Willowbrook instead.) Wassaic, too, had a reputation for being grim. At least one note from the report sent to my mother indicated that my aunt was very keen on leaving it. The date was January 18, 1980. Adele was by then 28 years old and had enough of a vocabulary to get her point across. “Clothes and suitcase?” she asked one of the clinicians.<br><br> Even when my aunt finally transferred to residential care, living in private homes and attending local programs in upstate New York, her treatment, until the &#39;90s, seemed less than ideal. In March of 1980, my aunt attended a day facility in an old factory that still had very loud electric and pneumatic machines, and the result was disastrous—“agitated, violent outbursts.” She was frequently taken to the “Quiet Room,” quilted with actual padded walls, where the staff would physically restrain her. This practice, the report notes, is no longer used in New York.<br><br> It took seven years and nine months before her team realized that the industrial cacophony was causing a good deal of the problem.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It is mid-December 2022.</span> Adele&#39;s genetic test has come back.<br><br> Her disorder does indeed have a name. Remarkably, it would not have had a name if we&#39;d tested her just four years ago. But in 2020, a group of 50-plus researchers announced their discovery of Coffin-Siris syndrome 12, the “12” signifying a rare subtype within an already rare disorder. At the time they made this discovery, they could identify just 12 people in the world whose intellectual disability was caused by a mutation in this particular gene. Since then, says Scott Barish, the lead author of the paper announcing the finding, the number has climbed to somewhere between 30 and 50. So now, with my aunt, it&#39;s that number plus one.<br><br> I immediately join a Facebook group for people with Coffin-Siris syndrome. I find only a few parents with children who have the same subtype as Adele. One couple lives in Moscow; another, Italy. But as soon as I post something about my aunt, there&#39;s a flurry of replies from mothers and fathers of kids across the Coffin-Siris spectrum, most of them focused on the same thing: Adele&#39;s age. Seventy-one! How thrilling that someone with Coffin-Siris syndrome could live that long! They want to know all about her, and what kind of health she is in. (Robust, I reply.)<br><br> Because Coffin-Siris syndrome, first described in 1970, can be caused by mutations in any one of a variety of genes, its manifestations vary. As a rule, though, the disorder involves some level of intellectual disability and developmental delays. Many people with Coffin-Siris syndrome also have “coarse facial features,” a phrase I&#39;ve come to absolutely loathe; trouble with different organ systems; and underdeveloped pinkie fingers or toes (which is how, before genetic testing came along, a specialist might suspect a patient had it). Some, though by no means all, have microcephaly.<br><br> As far as I know, my aunt&#39;s fingers and toes are all fully developed—Coffin-Siris syndrome 12 doesn&#39;t seem to affect pinkies as much—and she doesn&#39;t appear to have any organ trouble. She does, however, have microcephaly, as did four of the 12 subjects in<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cell.com/ajhg/fulltext/S0002-9297(20)30400-6">the breakthrough paper about her specific subtype</a> . But what really stood out to me in that study—and I mean really shone in a hue all its own—was this: Five of the dozen subjects displayed autistic traits.<br><br> In fact, the sparse literature on this subject suggests that a substantial portion of people with Coffin-Siris syndrome, no matter what genetic variant they&#39;ve got, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2021.802583/full">have a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder as well</a> .<br><br> Which is what I&#39;ve suspected my aunt has had all along.<br><br> Knowing what I now do, I&#39;m that much keener to find a family with a child who has Coffin-Siris syndrome 12 that would be willing to welcome me into their home. I call Barish, the lead author of the breakthrough paper, who heroically refers me to two. But one suddenly becomes shy and the other lives in Ireland. I start making my way through the other 50 co–first authors, co–corresponding authors, and just plain co-authors listed in the study. For a long while, I get nothing—turns out I&#39;m talking to lab people, mostly—though I learn a lot about protein complexes and gene expression.<br><br> Then I reach Isabelle Thiffault, a molecular geneticist at Children&#39;s Mercy Kansas City. By some extraordinary fluke, she has, in her database, <i>four</i> children with my aunt&#39;s subtype. Two have microcephaly. One of those two is a 7-year-old girl named Emma, who lives in the Kansas City area.<br><br> I call her mom, Grace Feist. Would she mind if I paid a visit? She would not.<br><br> Grace and her husband, Jerry, took Emma in at seven months old and adopted her at a year and a half, knowing she had significant intellectual and developmental delays. They were prepared. They had fallen in love.<br><br> They also had ample state resources at their disposal, heavily subsidized or even free. More still: They had a rich universe of support groups to draw from, a sophisticated public school in their backyard, and the benefit of a culture that&#39;s come a long way toward appreciating neurodiversity.<br><br> They were able to actively choose Emma. Whereas my grandparents—pressured by doctors, stamped by stigma, broken by exhaustion and confusion and pain—felt like they had no choice but to give their daughter away.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">“So this is</span> the best thing, because it will keep your hair nice and neat, and it doesn&#39;t have any tingles.”<br><br> Tingles? I ask. It&#39;s late February of 2023. We&#39;re sitting in Emma&#39;s bedroom in Lee&#39;s Summit, Missouri, and she&#39;s waving a new silk pillowcase at me.<br><br> “They&#39;re like big stuff in your hair.” She gestures at her thick brown ponytail.<br><br> Tingles … oh, tangles!<br><br> She nods. “Guess what? Tangles will get in your hair. If Mommy&#39;s brushing, I will be so mad.”<br><br> A few feet from her is a mounted poster that says <span class="smallcaps">For like Ever</span> . As in: <i>We&#39;ve embraced this little girl for life—for, like, ever.</i> Grace got it at TJ Maxx shortly after Emma&#39;s adoption became official.<br><br> Every time I hear Emma speak, I find it hard to believe that she and my aunt have a mutation in the same gene. She chatters merrily in full sentences, talks about her friends, and can express how she feels, often in ways that are surprising or quite poignant.<br><br> “Emma, are you the same as other kids or different?” Grace asks when we pick her up at school the next day.<br><br> “Different.”<br><br> “Why?” she asks.<br><br> “Because I&#39;m the only one doing coloring. Not the other kids.”<br><br> “Do you like being different?” I ask her.<br><br> “No.”<br><br> “Why?” I ask.<br><br> “Because I want to be like other people.”<br><br> But what I&#39;m stuck on is all the ways that Emma <i>started out</i> like my aunt. When Grace and Jerry (a very involved father, just shy around reporters) first took her in at seven months to foster her, “she just lay there like a two-month-old baby,” Grace says. “We thought she was blind.” She didn&#39;t make eye contact; she couldn&#39;t roll. But in Bismarck, North Dakota, where Grace and Jerry were living at the time, Emma was entitled to all kinds of state-funded early intervention, as she is in Missouri. By nine months old, she was sitting unsupported, thanks to hours spent in a special tube swing to help her develop her core muscles.<br><br> Emma wasn&#39;t as late to walk as Adele, but she didn&#39;t take her first wobbly step until 16 months, and because it was 2016, rather than the early 1950s, physical therapists again intervened, having her toddle on uneven surfaces—pillows, cushions—to bolster muscle tone. She developed a smoother gait at about 2, but it took a couple more years for her to have the balance and coordination to walk normally, or to climb the stairs without help.<br><br> And speech! A huge surprise. Emma may be a bubbly ingenue, telling me all about indoor recess and her BFFs at school, but that&#39;s hardly how she started. When she was 4 years old, she had only 100 words in her vocabulary, and that&#39;s a generous estimate. “The way it was described was: She&#39;s not deaf, but it&#39;s almost the speech of someone who can&#39;t hear,” Grace says. But Emma was working with state-funded speech therapists at the time, and they determined that she had auditory-processing disorder. When she got to her public school in Lee&#39;s Summit—which gives extra speech and occupational therapy to those who need it, plus additional reading and math instruction—her vocabulary started to grow, slowly at first, and then in a rush. “I don&#39;t know what it was,” Grace says.<br><br> Well. I have some idea. It was having a supportive school. It was having several hours a week of occupational, physical, and speech therapy from the time Emma was an infant. And it was Grace herself.<br><br> If you&#39;re going to have an intellectual disability, who you really want as your mother is Grace Feist. Thirty-three, forever in flip-flops, and brimming with opinions—she has the concentrated energy of a honeybee—Grace has gone to exceptional lengths to tend to Emma&#39;s education and psychological well-being. She&#39;s decorated the basement playroom in pastels and muted colors. (“With visual-processing disorder, which Emma has, it&#39;s not as overwhelming,” Grace explains.) Once a week, she takes Emma to vision therapy; she picks Emma up at school early every day to focus even more on her reading and math at home, without distraction. Grace is the queen of resourcefulness when it comes to all things pedagogical.<br><br> “I had a developmental pediatrician tell me: &#39;There is no rock you haven&#39;t looked under. This is what you have, and that&#39;s okay,&#39; ” she says. “And he came from the best of intentions. But let me tell you, there were, like, 50 rocks I hadn&#39;t looked under.”<br><br> As Grace and Emma give me a tour of Emma&#39;s in-home classroom, all I can think is, <i>My God, the effort</i> . It contains a bucket of at least 80 fidget toys, many of them simple household items repurposed for anxious hands (silicone sink scrubbers, sewing bobbins). Emma sits on a purple wobble disk—it looks like a whoopee cushion the size of a satellite dish—to continue developing her core muscles. The walls are lined with giant flash cards from Secret Stories, a phonics-based reading program that makes intuitive sense and seems kind of <i>fun</i> , which is a good thing, because almost nothing demoralizes Emma more than trying to read. She can barely do it, though she&#39;s trying.<br><br> “How does reading feel?” Grace asks.<br><br> “Mad,” Emma says. She&#39;s wearing a resplendent lavender shirt with daisies on it. “Because if Mommy say, &#39;Read this now,&#39; I would be super grumpy. Because they have hard words.” She&#39;s pointing to a rudimentary book she&#39;s been struggling with. “But some people say, &#39;This is easy!&#39; ”<br><br> “How does that make you feel?” Grace asks.<br><br> “Mad. Sad.”<br><br> We move on to look at the shelves on the wall. They&#39;re stocked with tactile learning tools: numbers made of sandpaper. Montessori cubes showing multiples of 10. Wax Wikki Stix to make letter shapes.<br><br> “If you change the approach to everything being multisensory—you see it, you hear it, you taste it, you touch it, you smell it—then you learn it,” Grace says. “Because you&#39;re using all these neural pathways for the same information. Then everyone can learn.”<br><br> Perhaps I shouldn&#39;t be surprised by Grace&#39;s tenacity. She was raised in Florida, near Orlando, and had her first daughter, Chloe, at 16. She joined the Navy as a reservist in 2010 and worked for a time as a military police officer; then she worked security in an oil field in North Dakota, where she made great money and got to see the northern lights, as long as she was willing to put up with temperatures 20 degrees below zero. She met Jerry, then an information technologist, on the website Plenty of Fish. Today, he&#39;s a professional YouTuber, with an inspirational-Christian channel that has 2.6 million subscribers. On December 28, 2016, they adopted Emma. In 2018, Grace gave birth to another daughter, Anna.<br><br> “Having Anna was the best thing for Emma,” Grace says, “because it really taught her how to play—with other kids, even with toys. That mimicking, that seeing what to do. Because when you would buy Emma toys, she would just line them up.”<br><br> Grace and Jerry have made enormous sacrifices on Emma&#39;s behalf. The whole family has. They don&#39;t travel, because Emma needs structure and control. They seldom go to restaurants, but when they do, they bring along her purple noise-canceling headphones—shooting earmuffs, purchased at Walmart—in case the sound overwhelms her; she needs to leave the restaurant several times a meal in any event, just to ground herself. “That&#39;s how we live our life,” Grace says.<br><br> Their life used to be even more difficult. When she was younger, Emma, like my aunt, was inclined toward self-harm. When I first mention to Grace that Adele has no teeth—and that I fear they were removed at Willowbrook or Wassaic—Grace cuts me off: “Because she would bite herself until she bled?”<br><br> Sweet Jesus. I hadn&#39;t even thought of that.<br><br> “Because Emma did,” Grace says. “I have pictures of it.”<br><br> She doesn&#39;t show me those pictures. But she does show me a picture of 4-year-old Emma with a giant green-and-purple Frankenstein bruise bulging from her forehead. “She&#39;d hit herself in the face,” Grace says. “She would bang her head on the floor, like, hard.”<br><br> And why does she think Emma did that? “She&#39;s trapped in this mind where she knows what she wants, she knows what she needs, but <i>you</i> don&#39;t know, and she doesn&#39;t know how to tell you,” Grace says. “Is she aggressive?是的。 I would be pissed too.”<br><br> I haven&#39;t noticed any aggression in Emma—just a lot of sass, a gal who wants to show off her dance moves and introduce me to her stuffies. But again, this may be in part due to early-childhood interventions: Armies of occupational and speech therapists taught her how to be gentle, demonstrating how to talk kindly to dolls, and they encouraged Grace to teach Emma sign language, which she did, so that Emma could better express her wishes. As Emma got older, Grace read tons of books about emotional self-regulation, teaching her daughter to externalize her frustration. “We&#39;d be in the middle of Walmart and she&#39;d be stomping her feet,” Grace says. “But you know what? She wasn&#39;t punching herself in the head.”<br><br> Today, Emma is flourishing. She may not yet know her phone number or address. She may not be able to tell you the names of the months or all the days of the week. But she&#39;s making great strides, especially now that she&#39;s learning at home. When I left her house in late February, she could count to 12; four months later, she was adding and subtracting. “Emma is going to thrive in her life,” Grace says. “Is she going to work at McDonald&#39;s? Maybe. Is she gonna bag groceries? Maybe. But she&#39;s gonna be okay.” Grace&#39;s goal, she says, is to make sure that Emma&#39;s mental health always comes first. “I have never met anyone more resilient or determined,” she adds.<br><br> As I prepare to leave, Grace gives me two gifts she&#39;s purchased for my aunt. They&#39;re things Emma likes: a lavender-scented unicorn Warmie (a stuffed animal you can safely heat in the microwave) and Pinch Me therapy dough that smells like oranges. “Anything scented is always really calming for Emma,” she explains.<br><br> Then Emma hands me a picture she&#39;s drawn of me and Adele. Grace asks if she remembers why she drew it. “Yeah!” Emma says. “Because she has a hard time going to school.”<br><br> “Like you,” Grace says. Then: “You know what her aunt has?”<br><br> I assume she is going to say something about Coffin-Siris syndrome 12, but in a way that&#39;s comprehensible to a child who has it too. But that isn&#39;t where Grace is headed. “She has a woman who loves her and takes care of her because her mommy wasn&#39;t able to. Just like you. Did you know that?”<br><br> Emma shakes her head.<br><br> I thank Grace and Emma for the gifts and head out to my rental car. I last maybe 30 seconds before losing it.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Is it a fair</span> or genuine comparison, lining up my aunt and Emma side by side? Using Emma&#39;s life story thus far as some kind of counterfactual history? To ask <i>What if?</i><br><br> Yes and no, obviously.<br><br> There&#39;s variability in all genetic disorders, including Coffin-Siris syndrome, even among those with mutations in the same gene. The original paper looking at my aunt&#39;s specific subtype found that four out of the 12 individuals had microcephaly, for example, but one had macrocephaly;去搞清楚。 My aunt and Emma, though they both have subtype 12, clearly have different manifestations of it, a phenomenon one can observe just from looking at them: Emma is big for her age while my aunt is tiny; my aunt&#39;s microcephaly is unignorable, because her sutures—the flexible material between a baby&#39;s skull bones—closed prematurely, while Emma&#39;s didn&#39;t, making her microcephaly harder to detect. Her doctor says it may be easier to see as she gets older, though.<br><br> “If your aunt had had the treatments available today, I suspect her life would be very different,” says Bonnie Sullivan, the clinical geneticist at Children&#39;s Mercy Kansas City who treats Emma. We&#39;re speaking just days after I return home. She has looked at both Adele&#39;s and Emma&#39;s specific gene mutations. “She may not have been as high-functioning as Emma, but she could have maximized her potential, and her quality of life would&#39;ve been a lot better.”<br><br> It seems impossible to quarrel with this assessment. The literature on disability is bursting with stories—heartening or depressing, depending on your point of view—about the advances made by people with intellectual disabilities once they were liberated from the medieval torments of their institutions. Studies as far back as the 1960s showed that children with Down syndrome begin to speak earlier and have higher IQs if they&#39;re kept in home settings rather than institutional ones. Judith Scott, warehoused with Down syndrome in 1950 at the age of 7, famously became an artist once her twin sister established herself as her legal guardian 35 years later; her handsome fiber-art sculptures are now part of the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Centre Pompidou.<br><br> If my aunt could expand her vocabulary simply by going off a useless antipsychotic, imagine what else she might have been capable of over the course of her life, if only she&#39;d been given a hundredth of a chance.<br><br> But perhaps the best-known example of what happens to underloved, understimulated children are <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/can-an-unloved-child-learn-to-love/612253/">the orphans from Nicolae Ceauşescu&#39;s Romania</a> , where “child gulags” warehoused some 170,000 kids in appalling conditions. These children became tragic, unwilling conscripts in an inadvertent mass experiment in institutional neglect. When, 11 years after Ceauşescu&#39;s execution, American researchers finally began to study 136 of them, putting half in foster settings and monitoring their development, the findings were bleak. Only 18 percent of those still in orphanages <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4098033/">showed secure attachments by age 3 and a half</a> , versus almost 50 percent of those who&#39;d been transferred to family settings. By the time the kids still in orphanages had reached 16, more than 60 percent suffered from a psychiatric condition.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/07/can-an-unloved-child-learn-to-love/612253/">From the July/August 2020 issue: 30 years ago, Romania deprived thousands of babies of human contact</a><br><br> Which brings me back to my aunt&#39;s repeated diagnoses, over the years, of psychosis. Maybe the condition was inevitable; maybe my aunt would have been psychotic no matter what kind of life she&#39;d led. But when I watched those gruesome spools of footage from Willowbrook, all I could think was: <i>Who wouldn&#39;t be driven mad by such a place?</i> After she left Willowbrook, Adele would abruptly shout “Stop hurting me!” for no apparent reason. Her care team assumed she was having hallucinations, a plausible postulate. But isn&#39;t it equally plausible to theorize that she was reliving some unspeakable abuse from her past? Or, as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-life-worth-living-disability-pain-and-morality-joel-michael-reynolds/9781517907785?affiliate_id=atl-347">Georgetown philosopher and disability-studies professor Joel Michael Reynolds</a> puts it (speaking my thoughts aloud): “Why isn&#39;t that a completely reasonable response to PTSD?”<br><br> I&#39;ll never know how Adele&#39;s life could have turned out if she&#39;d been born in 2015, as Emma was. All I have is a plague of questions.<br><br> What if a task force of occupational, speech, and physical therapists had shown up at my grandparents&#39; home each week, teaching Adele to walk, talk, and gently play with dolls?<br><br> What if she had spent her formative years not rotting in her own diapers or staring at the walls, but engaging in organized play, attending school, and basking in the company of adults who loved her?<br><br> What if she&#39;d had caretakers who inhaled book after book about emotional self-regulation and encouraged her to stomp her feet in department stores, rather than hit herself in the head?<br><br> And what if— <i>what if</i> —Adele had had a sister to play with?<br><br> It&#39;s possible that all the interventions in the world would have done nothing, or next to it. Sullivan says she&#39;s seen families recruit every imaginable expert and pour their energies into every conceivable intervention, yet with depressingly little to show for it. “There are some individuals with such severe manifestations of certain disorders that aggressive interventions don&#39;t seem to change the outcome very much,” she says. “And it kills me. I truly grieve that result. Because the parents are trying everything.”<br><br> Similarly, there are children who wind up in residential care in spite of their parents&#39; best and most valiant efforts, because their risk of self-harm or of harming others remains too great. Parents are not, nor should they be expected to be, saints.<br><br> But my mind keeps looping back to that eight-page report my mother was sent about Adele&#39;s history. The notes from Willowbrook, what few there are, tell a story all their own.<br><br> March 19, 1953: <i>21-month-old girl, quite small for her age … able to sit without support, to imitate movements, and is reported to be able to say “mama.”</i> Adele&#39;s IQ is measured at 52.<br><br> February 1, 1960: <i>Microcephalic child of 8 ½ years with limited speech and partial echolalia. She is disoriented, and her acquaintance with simple objects in her surroundings is rather poor even for her overall mental level … Rate of development has markedly slowed down since the last evaluation 7 years ago.</i> <i>The consequent drop in IQ is considerable.</i> This time it is measured at 27.<br><br> In her seven years of staring at those walls and rocking naked on the floor and never once, I assume, being shown a particle of love apart from those brief visits from my grandparents, Adele&#39;s IQ dropped by almost half, startling even those who evaluated her. And yes, maybe this was destined to happen; maybe her smaller brain had less noticeable consequences in a toddler than in an 8-year-old.<br><br> But if my aunt could expand her vocabulary simply by going off a useless antipsychotic and onto Zyprexa—in middle age!—imagine what else she might have been capable of over the course of her life, if only she&#39;d been given a half, a quarter, a hundredth of a chance.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">It&#39;s A sunny day</span> in May of this year. I&#39;m working on the back deck, nearing the end of writing this story. My cellphone rings. It&#39;s Evelyn, Carmen&#39;s daughter. She apologizes for calling me on a Sunday, but something serious has happened. Adele has collapsed; she&#39;s in the hospital; it&#39;s looking bad. Can I please locate my mom?<br><br> I leave messages everywhere and call Adele&#39;s nurse, Emane, who I&#39;ve been told is in the hospital with her. Emane is upset. No one will tell her anything. She&#39;s been banished to the waiting room. They really need my mother, my aunt&#39;s medical proxy.<br><br> A few minutes later, my mother phones them. A few minutes after that, my father conveys the news to me: Adele has died.<br><br> A heart attack, apparently. Just after breakfast.<br><br> I call Evelyn. She is crying. I stammer my way through this conversation, also crying, but mainly because we barely got to know my aunt, because this was supposed to be the beginning of something and not the end, because I know the grief I feel in no way matches Evelyn&#39;s or Carmen&#39;s or Juan&#39;s. I am fluttering with an awkward mixture of shame, regret, sadness. “She was loved,” Evelyn keeps saying, over and over.<br><br> I know, I say. I just wish more by us.<br><br> “You came at exactly the right time,” Evelyn assures me. “I truly believe that.”<br><br> I hang up. God, they&#39;re so gracious, this family. “We don&#39;t judge,” Evelyn told us the first time we went up to see Adele at the Ayalas&#39;. She meant it.<br><br> I phone my mother. She has lurched into administrative mode, planning the funeral. This is peak Mom, organizing things, surmounting the tough stuff by finding footholds in the small details. I wait a bit and call Carmen, though with some trepidation. My mother says she was unhelmed—bawling—when they first spoke. Carmen, calmer but still sobbing throughout our talk, tells me it&#39;s true. “I broke down. I didn&#39;t expect it to happen like that.”<br><br> We bury Adele three days later. It&#39;s a gorgeous afternoon, perfect really, but the incongruities and dissonances of the hour are hard to ignore. Here we are, having a Jewish funeral for a woman who was never exposed to the Jewish tradition her whole life, while those whose lives have been most brutally upended—those who have spent the past 24 years loving and caring for Adele—are Catholics. My aunt will be buried next to her mother, forever reunited, while the woman whom she called “Mommy”—who just four nights ago rubbed Vicks VapoRub on her back and brought her tea because she had a cough—will go back to a house with an empty twin bed.<br><br> I&#39;d like to think that in the afterlife, my grandmother&#39;s heart will mend. That she will never again be told to send Adele away, that God will say to her: <i>It&#39;s okay, she&#39;s lovely as she is; she&#39;s my child too.</i><br><br> Problem is, I&#39;m not much of a believer. I wish I was.<br><br> But the rabbi, Lisa Rubin, is brilliant, making something seamless out of the chaotic threads of my aunt&#39;s life and the untidy grief of this motley group, managing to acknowledge the trauma of my mother, the trauma of my aunt, and the trauma of my grandparents, showing them the compassion they deserved their whole lives but probably never got and certainly never gave to themselves. And she honors the Ayala family in the most beautiful way, invoking the Jewish legend of the <i>Lamed Vavniks</i> , or 36 individuals in every generation who are the most righteous of all humanity. “They&#39;re often called the hidden saints among us,” she says. “The people who do God&#39;s work faithfully and humbly and whose virtue keeps the world spinning. They pour compassion and love on those around them with no desire for recognition.” To my family, she says, Carmen, Juan, and Evelyn are the <i>Lamed Vavniks</i> —“the hidden saints of Adele&#39;s life.”<br><br> The Ayalas are all discreetly weeping. Carmen will later tell me: <i>I will miss Adele so much</i> .<br><br> My mother is invited to speak next. Evelyn will speak after her, then one of Adele&#39;s housemates, then Adele&#39;s psychologist, then her case manager—it&#39;s wonderful that they&#39;ve turned up.<br><br> But my mother … I&#39;m not quite prepared. She starts with a version of something I&#39;ve heard before—that losing Adele was a trauma that took decades to heal. But then she elaborates in a way she hasn&#39;t even in our most intimate discussions: The three times she saw Adele back in the &#39;90s, she still felt disconnected from her. Adele&#39;s previous caretakers had left my mom and my grandmother (and in one case, my mom and me) all alone with my aunt in their living room; they hadn&#39;t said a thing about who Adele was or what her place was in their home. That changed, my mother says, when she saw Adele at the Ayalas&#39;, discovering the charming, idiosyncratic character of her baby sister—and how very much she was loved, how she fit into a family.<br><br> “Those visits changed everything for me,” she says. “I opened my heart to Adele after shutting her out for nearly 70 years, and I found myself loving her again the same way I did as a 6-year-old child.” I hear a catch in her voice. She pauses, then regains her composure. “Now,” she continues, “I&#39;ve lost Adele for the second time. And it hurts in a way I never expected. But I would not trade those visits for anything, because my life is so much richer. Adele has taught me to love in a whole new way.”<br><br> She finishes. And then, without warning, she rushes into the arms of my dad and starts crying in deep, seismic sobs. “I lost all those years,” she says into his shirt. I can barely make it out.<br><br> I&#39;ve never seen her sense of control desert her in this way.<br><br> My mind wanders back to the last time I saw Adele. It was December, when Emane swabbed her cheek. I was alone then, just me and my recording device; my mother was in Florida. Carmen reminded Adele that I was her niece, her sister&#39;s daughter. “Do you remember Rona?” she asked. “Yeah,” Adele said, but it wasn&#39;t a convincing “yeah”—more like one of the blank ones she uttered when she didn&#39;t understand.<br><br> We collected Adele&#39;s DNA, and then I stuck around, curious to see how my aunt passed her afternoons and evenings. Spending that brief stretch with her meant experiencing time in a sensual way, almost, just feeling the thickness of the hours as they passed. We sat for a while together in the kitchen. Then we went upstairs to her bedroom, a warm, delightful space, her dresser tumbling with stuffed animals and her bed popping with a pink Disney-princess blanket. Adele carefully selected her outfit for the next day, matching every item of clothing, down to her socks.<br><br> There are many different shades of periwinkle blue.我不知道。<br><br> Then she undressed, put on a plush lavender bathrobe, and headed into the shower to slowly bathe herself and wash her hair. Carmen supervised, but left her alone. After she&#39;d dried herself off, Adele headed back into her room, closed all of the blinds (“for night”), and settled into her rocking chair. She spent the next half an hour, at least, just rocking. She often wiggled her fingers in front of her eyes. Occasionally she broke into a smile or chanted the same words to herself (“paint, pepper”) or gave a little laugh. She seemed content.<br><br> But in the shower—and I&#39;ll never forget this, not for as long as my battered memory is intact—she babbled much more coherently. “Sister. Rona. Janet. Mirna. Rrrrrrrona”—she rolled the <i>R</i> —“A doll. A teddy bear.”<br><br> I&#39;ve listened to that wisp of audio dozens of times, just to make sure I didn&#39;t wish those words into existence.<br><br><i>姐姐。 Rona.</i> She was already committing my mother&#39;s name to memory, and to her own family tree, along with Carmen&#39;s daughter and daughter-in-law, Mirna and Janet. Her ability to sweep in such things was, as Evelyn said, her gift. And now, we in our family will finally be committing her name to ours, which for so long—so pointlessly long—had a phantom bough.<br><br> Adele Halperin. Daughter, sister, aunt.

The question that keeps me up at night now—with increasing urgency as 2024 approaches—is whether we have done enough to rebuild our defenses or whether our democracy is still highly vulnerable to attack and subversion.<br><br> There&#39;s reason for concern: the influence of dark money and corporate power, right-wing propaganda and misinformation, malign foreign interference in our elections, and the vociferous backlash against social progress. The “vast right-wing conspiracy” has been of compelling interest to me for many years. But I&#39;ve long thought something important was missing from our national conversation about threats to our democracy. Now recent findings from a perhaps unexpected source—America&#39;s top doctor—offer a new perspective on our problems and valuable insights into how we can begin healing our ailing nation.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2023/01/loneliness-solitude-pandemic-habit/672631/">Arthur C. Brooks: How we learned to be lonely</a><br><br> In May, Surgeon General Vivek Murthy published an <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf">advisory</a> , warning that a growing “epidemic of loneliness and isolation” threatens Americans&#39; personal health and also the health of our democracy. Murthy reported that, even before COVID, about half of all American adults were experiencing substantial levels of loneliness. Over the past two decades, Americans have spent significantly more time alone, engaging less with family, friends, and people outside the home. By 2018, just 16 percent of Americans said they felt very attached to their local community.<br><br> An “epidemic of loneliness” may sound abstract at a time when our democracy faces concrete and imminent threats, but the surgeon general&#39;s report helps explain how we became so vulnerable. In the past, surgeons general have at crucial moments sounded the alarm about major crises and drawn our attention to underappreciated threats, including <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/2020-cessation-sgr-full-report.pdf">smoking</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/sci_data/misc/type_txt/sgrpt.asp">HIV/AIDS</a> , and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/pdf/calltoaction.pdf">obesity</a> . This is one of those moments.<br><br> The rate of young adults who report suffering from loneliness went up every single year from 1976 to 2019. From 2003 to 2020, the average time that young people spent in person with friends declined by nearly 70 percent. Then the pandemic turbocharged our isolation.<br><br> According to the surgeon general, when people are disconnected from friends, family, and communities, their lifetime risk of heart disease, dementia, depression, and stroke skyrockets. Shockingly, prolonged loneliness is as bad, or worse, for our health as being obese or smoking up to 15 cigarettes a day. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/14/opinion/treating-loneliness.html?referringSource=articleShare">Researchers</a> also say that loneliness can generate anger, resentment, and even paranoia. It diminishes civic engagement and social cohesion, and increases political polarization and animosity. Unless we address this crisis, Murthy warned, “we will continue to splinter and divide until we can no longer stand as a community or a country.”<br><br> I <span class="smallcaps">n 1996,</span> I published <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/it-takes-a-village-hillary-rodham-clinton/9781416540649?affiliate_id=atl-347"><em>It Takes a Village</em></a> . As first lady, I was worried that American life had become frantic and fragmented for many people, especially stressed-out parents. Social, economic, and technological trends seemed to be pulling us apart rather than lifting us up. We were spending more time in our cars and in front of the television and less time engaging in our communities. Even back then, before smartphones and social media, it was evident that Americans were becoming more isolated, lonely, and unmoored from traditional sources of meaning and support—and that our kids were suffering because of this. I also was concerned about the rise of right-wing politicians like Newt Gingrich and media personalities like Rush Limbaugh who were sowing division and alienation.<br><br> Nearly 30 years later, it&#39;s clear that the problems I diagnosed in the 1990s ran deeper than I realized, and were more dire than I could have imagined. But the prescriptions in <em>It Takes a Village</em> —putting families first, investing in community infrastructure, protecting kids from out-of-control technology, and recommitting to the core American values of mutual responsibility and empathy—have only grown more urgent and necessary.<br><br> The surgeon general&#39;s warning echoes the findings of other researchers who have studied these trends for decades. In his influential 2000 book, <em>Bowling Alone</em> , the Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam showed that Americans&#39; social ties and support networks collapsed in the second half of the 20th century. Many of the activities and relationships that had defined and sustained previous generations, such as attending religious services and joining unions, clubs, and civic organizations—even participating in local bowling leagues—were disappearing. Putnam&#39;s more recent work shows that these trends have only gotten worse in the early decades of the 21st century, and that they go hand in hand with intensifying political polarization, economic inequality, loss of trust in government, and a shift in the national attitude from “we&#39;re all in this together” to “you&#39;re on your own.”<br><br> Murthy cites the work of another Harvard researcher, Raj Chetty, who <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/socialcapital_nontech.pdf">shows</a> how the decline of social connections between people of different classes and backgrounds—the kinds of relationships that used to be formed in VFW halls, church basements, and PTA meetings—has significantly reduced economic mobility in America. The data show that diverse, robust social networks make the American dream possible. Without them, it fades.<br><br> All of this aligns with the findings of the Princeton economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton. They attribute soaring rates of what they call “deaths of despair”—including suicides and deaths from alcohol and drug overdoses—to a toxic mix of economic stagnation, declining social ties, rising alienation, and families and communities coming apart.<br><br> The surgeon general points, as well, to the crucial role of technology. He highlights data showing that Americans who use social media for more than two hours a day are twice as likely to experience loneliness and feelings of social isolation as people who used social media for less than 30 minutes a day. As we spend more time online, we spend less time interacting with one another in person or engaging with our local communities. The more we live in social-media echo chambers, the less we trust one another, and the more we struggle to find common ground with or feel empathy for people who have different perspectives and experiences.<br><br> Murthy followed his report on loneliness with a second <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/sg-youth-mental-health-social-media-advisory.pdf">advisory</a> just 20 days later, warning that heavy social-media use among teenagers is driving a dangerous increase in depression and other mental-health challenges. From 2001 to 2021, the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db471.htm">suicide rate</a> among people in their early 20s surged by more than 60 percent. For 10-to-14-year-olds, it tripled. These are numbers that should shake us to our core.<br><br> My three grandchildren are too young to experience the worst of this. Still, I can&#39;t help but think about where they and their friends and classmates will be soon, exposed hour after hour to whatever content some hidden algorithm decides to promote. I worry about American children&#39;s self-esteem, their mental health, their sense of perspective and reality.<br><br> The way Americans—and young people in particular—interact with technology today, the way our phones and social-media networks inject bullying, abuse, misinformation, outrage, and anger directly into our brains, is not something any of us could have foreseen just a few short decades ago. When I wrote <em>It Takes a Village</em> , I was concerned about the effects on young people of violence on TV. Now, in the age of social media, those worries almost seem quaint.<br><br> W <span class="smallcaps">hat does all</span> of this loneliness and disconnection mean for our democracy?<br><br> Murthy carefully connects the dots between increasing social isolation and declining civic engagement. “When we are less invested in one another, we are more susceptible to polarization and less able to pull together to face the challenges that we cannot solve alone,” he <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/30/opinion/loneliness-epidemic-america.html">wrote</a> in <em>The New York Times.</em><br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/republicans-ukraine-putin-xi-trump-democracy/622898/">Hillary Rodham Clinton and Dan Schwerin: A state of emergency for democracy</a><br><br> It&#39;s not just the surgeon general who recognizes that social isolation saps the lifeblood of democracy. So do the ultra-right-wing billionaires, propagandists, and provocateurs who see authoritarianism as a source of power and profit.<br><br> There have always been angry young men alienated from mainstream society and susceptible to the appeal of demagogues and hate-mongers. But modern technology has taken the danger to another level. This was Steve Bannon&#39;s key insight.<br><br> Long before Bannon ran Donald Trump&#39;s presidential campaign, he was involved in the world of online gaming. He discovered an army of what he later described as “rootless white males,” disconnected from the real world but highly engaged online and often quick to resort to sexist and racist attacks. When Bannon took over the hard-right website <em>Breitbart News</em> , he was determined to turn these socially isolated gamers into the shock troops of the alt-right, pumping them full of conspiracy theories and hate speech. Bannon pursued the same project as a senior executive at Cambridge Analytica, the notorious data-mining and online-influence company largely owned by the right-wing billionaire Robert Mercer. According to a former Cambridge Analytica engineer turned <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/steve-bannon-targeted-incels-manipulate-cambridge-analytica-whistleblower-christopher-wylie-1468399">whistleblower</a> , Bannon targeted “incels,” or involuntarily celibate men, because they were easy to manipulate and prone to believing conspiracy theories. “You can activate that army,” Bannon told the <em>Bloomberg</em> journalist Joshua Green. “They come in through Gamergate or whatever and then get turned onto politics and Trump.”<br><br> Like many others, I was too slow to see the impact this strategy could have. Now the surgeon general is telling us that social disconnection is not just a problem at the margins—not just the usual “angry young men”—but is in fact an epidemic sweeping the country.<br><br> I have seen firsthand how dangerous lies can fuel violence and undermine our democratic process. During the 2016 campaign, a shocking number of people became convinced that I am a murderer, a terrorist sympathizer, and the evil mastermind behind a child-sex-abuse ring. Alex Jones, the right-wing talk-show host, posted a video about “all the children Hillary Clinton has personally murdered and chopped up and raped.”<br><br> This was not the first time that I was the subject of wild conspiracy theories or partisan rage that veered into mania. In the 1990s, supermarket tabloids used to splash headlines such as “ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2014/10/the-ingenious-sensationalism-of-the-weekly-world-new/381525/">Hillary Clinton Adopts Alien Baby</a> ” across their front pages. I was even <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1994/08/30/kentuckians-burn-first-lady-in-effigy/0d2ecc75-5341-4a43-8ebc-be91892de988/">burned in effigy</a> by a crowd in Kentucky furious that I had proposed taxing cigarettes to help fund universal health care for all Americans. The president of the Kentucky Association of Tobacco Supporters chanted, “Burn, baby, burn” as he poured gasoline on a scarecrow in a dress labeled <span class="smallcaps">I&#39;M HILLARY</span> . By 2016, I fully expected to play a starring role in the fever dreams of extremists at the margins of American politics.<br><br> But something had changed. Social media gave conspiracy theories far wider reach than ever before. Fox News and other right-wing media outlets gave outlandish lies “credibility.” And before Trump, we&#39;d never had a presidential candidate—and then an actual president—who used the biggest bully pulpit in the world to be an actual bully and traffic in this kind of trash. The results were tragic but predictable. In early December 2016, a 28-year-old man from North Carolina armed with a Colt AR-15 assault rifle shot up a pizzeria in Washington, DC, because he had read online that it was the headquarters of my supposed child-sex ring. Thankfully, no one was harmed. But the pizzeria attack foreshadowed the violence to come: QAnon followers and militia members storming the Capitol on January 6, 2021; mass shooters leaving behind manifestos riddled with misogyny, racism, anti-Semitism, and other conspiracy theories promoted in far-right echo chambers.<br><br> As we look ahead to 2024, the threat to our democracy is not just from more of this kind of violence—although I fear that is coming as well. Many Americans breathed a sigh of relief after last year&#39;s midterms because prominent election deniers and conspiracy theorists were defeated, including Kari Lake in Arizona and Doug Mastriano in Pennsylvania. But these statewide victories obscured more troubling developments at the local level.<br><br> Consider Peggy Judd, a middle-aged white woman from Cochise County, Arizona, who participated in the January 6 “Stop the Steal” rally and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tucsonsentinel.com/local/report/012521_judd_cochise_capitol/cochise-sup-judd-spreads-conspiracy-myths-deletes-facebook-after-taking-part-jan-6-capitol-march/">reportedly</a> promotes Trump&#39;s Big Lie about the 2020 election and QAnon conspiracy theories. Judd is not just some Facebook gadfly. She is an elected member of the Cochise County Board of Supervisors. And in 2022, she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/12/01/1140086777/midterm-elections-cochise-county-arizona-ruling">refused</a> to certify the results of the midterm elections until she was finally compelled to do so by a judge.<br><br> A recent <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b0NtEWCP5ewYn96RxjvI1kfbc18rOLNb/view">study</a> from the organization <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.informingdemocracy.org/">Informing Democracy</a> identified more than 200 local officials across six battleground states who, like Judd, have taken antidemocratic actions. Many of them are in a position to administer or influence the 2024 elections. They&#39;re county clerks and municipal election commissioners, state legislators and members of canvassing boards. They&#39;re people you&#39;ve probably never heard of who play vital roles in making our electoral system work.<br><br> A hallmark of American democracy is that elections have been largely run by local, usually nonpartisan volunteers and officials. Communities generally <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/06/06/public-trust-in-government-1958-2022/">trusted</a> these election administrators because they knew them—they saw them in the supermarket, at restaurants, at their kids&#39; schools. This patchwork system has always been vulnerable to localized corruption and racial discrimination, but most folks who raised their hands to help out did so with good intentions and good results.<br><br>不再。 As the trust and social ties that used to bind communities together have frayed, apathy, isolation, and polarization have undercut the old “we&#39;re all in this together” ethos. Instead of nonpartisan volunteers and civic organizations like the League of Women Voters, we have MAGA election deniers and QAnon enthusiasts. There&#39;s now a widespread <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/3669329-us-faces-election-worker-shortage-ahead-of-midterms-due-to-rise-in-threats/">shortage</a> of poll workers because so many have faced harassment and abuse, just for doing their jobs and helping people vote.<br><br> In Fulton County, Georgia, the election worker Shaye Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman, who helped out in 2020 as a temp, faced racist death threats after Trump falsely accused them of orchestrating massive fraud. “I just felt bad for my mom,” Moss later told the January 6 congressional committee, “and I felt horrible for picking this job and being the one that always wants to help and always [be] there, never missing not one election.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/indictment-donald-trump-fulton-georgia-mar-a-lago-documents-january-6/672800/">David A. Graham: A guide to the possible forthcoming indictments of Donald Trump</a><br><br> American democracy needs people like Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman to keep raising their hands and offering to help. This country was built by men and women who believed in service, community, and working together for the greater good—pioneers who stuck together in wagon trains, farmers who pitched in on barn raisings and quilting bees, immigrants who joined volunteer fire departments, enslaved people who risked their lives to serve on the Underground Railroad and help others escape to freedom. Murthy and Putnam might call these ties social capital. In the 1830s, the French writer Alexis de Tocqueville visited America and wrote about our “habits of the heart.” However we describe it, the sense that “we&#39;re all in it together” made our democratic experiment possible—and it may be the only thing that can save us still.<br><br> Without a doubt, winning elections at every level is essential. We need to defeat the demagogues and election deniers so convincingly that there&#39;s no room for dirty tricks. And it&#39;s heartening that organizations like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://runforsomething.net/">Run for Something</a> are mobilizing candidates for school boards, county clerkships, and state legislatures across the country. We also need to strengthen voting rights and fight back against misinformation. But ultimately, winning the next election is never going to be enough. We must work together to restitch our unraveling social fabric, and to rebuild Americans&#39; trust in one another, our democracy, and our shared future.<br><br> Although there is an important debate to be had about how much economic conditions contribute to loneliness and alienation, the significant investments being made under President Joe Biden can lift both incomes and aspirations. The historic legislation enacted by Biden and the Democrats in Congress will modernize infrastructure, bring supply chains home, and boost manufacturing in key industries such as semiconductors and electric vehicles. These investments may help stem the outflow of workers and young people forced to leave their communities to seek opportunity far from home, leaving behind friends, families, and emotional and spiritual support systems. Too often, when Americans face boarded-up storefronts, empty pews, and crumbling schools, it&#39;s despair, loneliness, and resentment that fill the void. Bringing opportunity back to these hard-hit places and enabling more Americans to stay and raise families where their roots are won&#39;t reverse the toxic impacts of social media, disrupt the right-wing media machine, or end our political polarization, but it&#39;s a step in the right direction. We can build on that by raising taxes on the wealthiest individuals and corporations to buttress our social safety net and invest in schools and communities.<br><br> In his advisory, Murthy offers other recommendations for rebuilding social connection and cohesion. They include pro-family policies such as paid leave, and investments in public transit and community infrastructure that help people connect with one another in real life, not just online. He has also called for stronger and more sophisticated oversight and regulation of tech companies. In particular, there is an urgent need for more protections for kids on social media. And Murthy rightly argues that we can all do more in our own lives to nurture relationships with friends, family members, and neighbors, and seek out opportunities to serve and support others.<br><br> I offered similar prescriptions in <em>It Takes a Village</em> , arguing that we need to work together to help families raise healthy, successful children. Some of the work I envisioned would happen at home, such as families turning off screens and spending more time together. Much of it would be in communities, with local businesses, schools, congregations, and unions doing more to bring us together and help parents who often feel alone and overburdened. I thought government could help support that community engagement. For example, I was a big supporter of a Clinton-administration program that gave poor families in public housing vouchers to move to safer, middle-income neighborhoods where their children could make friends and find mentors from different backgrounds. I was convinced that we had to come together as a national village and decide that helping all our kids live up to their God-given potential is more important than profits or partisanship.<br><br> These basic principles still ring true, and the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/hendren/publications/effects-exposure-better-neighborhoods-children-new-evidence-moving-opportunity">evidence</a> continues to show that this approach works. The children of those families that we helped move to better neighborhoods in the 1990s have grown up to attend college at higher rates, earn higher incomes, and have more stable families of their own than their peers who stayed behind. And the younger the kids were when they moved, the bigger boost they received.<br><br> In recent years, I&#39;ve often thought back to <em>It Takes a Village</em> . The pandemic should have been a case study in how Americans come together in the face of a common challenge. And at the beginning, there was a sense of solidarity and shared sacrifice. People realized that if their neighbor got sick, it could harm them too, and that the virus was striking everyone. The entire village was at risk. We really were all in it together. Tragically, this spirit quickly faded. President Trump and other right-wing leaders politicized the pandemic and turned public health into a wedge issue—a staggeringly shortsighted and dangerous move with predictably deadly results. And when data first emerged showing that COVID-19 was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7762908/#:~:text=Approximately%2097.9%20out%20of%20every,Asians%20(40.4%20per%20100%2C000).">disproportionately</a> affecting Black and Latino communities, support for safety precautions and shared sacrifice dropped among white people and conservatives. Instead of a story of our common humanity, the pandemic became a story of our fractured society and poisoned politics.<br><br> I haven&#39;t given up, though. I still believe in the wisdom and power of the American village. I&#39;m inspired by the moms and dads <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/21/1087000890/book-bans-and-the-threat-of-censorship-rev-up-political-activism-in-the-suburbs">showing up</a> at school-board meetings and getting involved in local politics for the first time because they refuse to let extremists ban books from the neighborhood library. I love reading about teenagers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/teens-ditching-smartphones-social-media-to-become-luddites-2022-10">turning</a> to old-school flip phones so they&#39;re no longer at the mercy of giant tech firms and hidden algorithms. I&#39;m encouraged by the growing number of companies giving employees <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.maketimetovote.org/">time off to vote</a> and recognizing that they have responsibilities not just to shareholders but also to workers, customers, communities, and the planet. And I take heart from the workers bravely <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://abcnews.go.com/Business/amazon-starbucks-workers-led-union-resurgence-2022/story?id=95090198">organizing</a> corporate warehouses and coffee shops, or walking a picket line, breathing new life into the labor movement and insisting that even in our fractured age, we are still stronger together.<br><br> If you dig deep enough, through all the mud of politics and polarization, eventually you hit something hard and true: a foundation of values and aspirations that bind us together as Americans. That&#39;s something to build on. If we can break out of our toxic “us versus them” dichotomies, if we can shrink our notion of “the other” and expand the “we” in “we the people,” perhaps we can discover that we have more in common than we think.<br> Though we are divided in so many ways, though we are lonelier and more isolated than ever, it remains true that none of us can raise a family, build a business, strengthen a community, or heal a nation alone. We have to do it together. It still takes a village.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 07 Aug 2023 10:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

orszag, szabad egyetem</i> ”（“自由国家，自由大学”），知道他们的自由也受到威胁。自2010年上台以来，欧尔班削弱了该国最高法院，重写了匈牙利宪法，从根本上限制了新闻自由，并污蔑了外国对其公民社会组织的捐款。高喊口号的人群知道，对大学的袭击是巩固一党独裁统治的又一步。<br><br>欧尔班反对大学的运动并没有随着中欧大学的成立而结束。首先，他砍掉了匈牙利最杰出的科学机构——科学院，剥夺了它的独立研究机构。然后，他强迫匈牙利自己的大学系统的很大一部分私有化，在其董事会中塞满了党派忠诚者，并向马蒂亚斯·科维努斯学院投入资源，这是一个新的精英机构，其明确的任务是为匈牙利精英提供传统的爱国教育明天的。<br><br>

年，作为一名年轻的民主活动家，欧尔班是最早呼吁从匈牙利遣返苏联军队的人之一。三十年后，他因亲俄立场而成为北约和欧盟成员国领导人中的异类。欧尔班迟迟没有谴责总统弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)入侵乌克兰的行为，但他敦促乌克兰人寻求和平协议，并禁止通过匈牙利边境运送有助于乌克兰战争的武器。<br><br>特朗普政府及其驻布达佩斯大使并没有对欧尔班向独裁者求爱或驱逐一所获得美国认证的高等教育机构犹豫不决，而是只是象征性地抵制了对中欧大学的攻击，这似乎是基于索罗斯的任何敌人都必须采取的原则。成为他们的朋友。 2019年以来，外国保守派纷纷涌入布达佩斯拜倒在匈牙利大师脚下。他们中的一些人，比如加拿大前总理斯蒂芬·哈珀，似乎很天真。表面上寻求右翼政党之间更密切的国际联系，他们似乎想相信，像他们一样，他是一个宪政保守派——而事实上，他是一党制国家的独裁老板。<br><br>其他人确切地知道他是谁，这就是吸引他们的地方：他的专制男子气概。欧尔班法院的美国恳求者名单包括迈克·彭斯和塔克·卡尔森等政治人物，以及罗德·德雷尔、克里斯托弗·鲁福和帕特里克·德宁等右翼知识分子。美国保守党政治行动会议已在布达佩斯举行了一次会议，欧尔班去年受邀在达拉斯举行的该会议上担任主旨发言人。<br><br>

世纪的保守派调制了一杯令人陶醉的鸡尾酒。欧尔班宣称，保守派的任务无非是扭转西方的衰落。时间已经晚了。无神论的自由主义、享乐主义、放纵主义和世界主义已经完成了致命的工作。颓废已经到了晚期。在 7 月的一次聚会上，他怒吼道：“今天，‘西方价值观’意味着三件事：移民、LGBTQ

。欧尔班对美国保守派的吸引力在于，他将政治理解为争夺文化霸权的斗争。认为美国保守派成为意大利马克思主义者安东尼奥·葛兰西的追随者可能很奇怪，葛兰西将赢得霸权作为其政治战略概念的核心，但他们都认为大学是影响力的轴心。他们相信，谁拥有文化霸权，谁就能获得政治霸权。<br><br>顺便说一句，这是一个牵强的想法。在美国这样一个极其多样化和分裂的国家，有谁，无论政治倾向如何，有希望行使文化霸权吗？然而，文化霸权的目标似乎是州长罗恩·德桑蒂斯集中精力控制佛罗里达州教育系统的原因；重写黑人研究和其他科目的学校课程；解雇多元化、公平和包容官员；并赋予大学受托人审查和解雇国家系统中终身教授的权力。这也解释了德桑蒂斯对他最近收购的新学院的重视，新学院是萨拉索塔一所受人尊敬但鲜为人知的文科机构。一月份，他任命了董事会成员，任命了新的管理团队，并解雇了总统——所有这些都是为了将​​这个机构重塑为基督教保守派堡垒，以对抗“觉醒”意识形态。<br><br>为什么共和党总统候选人会浪费政治资本来撼动一所小型文理学院，大学的课程和管理如何成为争夺美国灵魂的另一个战场？与似乎不太关心这些问题的前总统唐纳德·特朗普不同，德桑蒂斯似乎痴迷于控制这个行业——把一切都押在这场文化霸权的斗争上。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/05/ron-desantis-florida-state-politics-gop/673489/">摘自 2023 年 5 月号：美国最奇怪、最痴迷自由的州是如何落入独裁州长之手的？</a><br><br>从这一点来说，他是欧尔班的弟子。在布达佩斯，CEU 是一所小型的、以研究为导向的社会科学和人文研究生院——你可能会认为，这对欧尔班政权来说算不上是眼中钉。但这会误解欧尔班如何看待我们。对他来说，我们的大学是他努力将自己塑造成保守文化斗士、反击自由世界主义所谓的触手影响的努力的一个有价值的象征性目标。一旦大学以这种方式构建，它们就会对自我推销的煽动者产生不可抗拒的吸引力。<br><br>大学还有另一个重要特征：它们很容易受到民粹主义的攻击。佛罗里达州的新学院是一所小型机构，当然拥有忠实的校友，但几乎没有政治影响力。这种机构会让斯大林调皮地问，<i>它有多少个部门？</i> CEU 也是如此。它拥有一些文化资本，就像乔治·索罗斯在东欧的流亡遗产一样，但欧尔班意识到，CEU 作为一个在外国运营的小型美国认可机构，其校友基础不断增长但规模不大，是一只坐鸭子。这些煽动者太聪明了，不会与与他们同等大小的人发生冲突。<br><br>对于这类右翼民粹主义者来说，攻击学院和大学也激起了从未上过大学的人们的怨恨，他们可能不喜欢大学学位可以赋予其受益人的权利，这通常是公正的。如果特朗普时代的共和党选民的重要组成部分可能是高中未毕业的人，那么对大学的攻击纯粹是煽动者的利己主义。同样，对于这些愤怒的选民来说，这种攻击的负面影响——削弱大学所带来的科学、技术和文化创新——并没有多大影响。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/viktor-orban-american-conservatism-admiration/671205/">雅各布·海尔布伦（Jacob Heilbrunn）：美国右翼对欧尔班·维克多（Viktor Orbán）着迷的背后</a><br><br>最后，或许也是最重要的一点，<i>文化斗争</i>对大学的攻击既是定义性的（从领袖品牌的意义上来说）也是转移注意力的。如果一位领导人认真解决被排除在外的选民群体的不满情绪，他根本不会关注大学。相反，他会认真审视企业的力量、它们的税率和避税，以及它们的工作外包，更不用说它们对数字公共领域的压倒性控制。这位领导人会关注最富有公民的收入，看看可以采取哪些措施将部分财富转移到改善学校、医院、诊所和其他公共设施上，为人们，特别是那些没有受过大学教育的人，提供公平的开始。生活。但针对大学和他们所谓的受宠爱的自由派教授比解决资助他的竞选活动的企业捐助者阶级的额外津贴和权力要容易得多。<br><br>欧尔班是这种转移政治注意力的大师，他乐于迎合自由派对他攻击学术自由的谴责，同时耐心地继续他的核心业务——利用国家权力为他的支持者致富。他曾经向我的一位银行家朋友坦言，他有很多人要养活：他知道，​​正如普京和土耳其总统雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安等其他独裁者一样，养活朋友是独裁者保住权力的方式。<br><br>在欧尔班·维克托开始反对 CEU 的运动<span class="smallcaps">六年后</span>，效仿他的保守派已经意识到，把大学当作敌人是多么方便。这些对大学自治和学术自由的攻击——在美国各州、在纳伦德拉·莫迪领导下的印度和在埃尔多安领导下的土耳其——主要是为了一件事：系统性地削弱任何可能成为独裁权力障碍的机构。尽管美国保守派与国外的独裁派一样，一贯用伪民主的术语来描述他们对大学的攻击——试图保护沉默的大多数免受自由派精英的意识形态威胁——但他们的真正议程是削弱民主制衡。<br><br>大学通常不被理解，更很少被捍卫为防止民主屈服于多数人暴政的护栏机构，但这就是大学的作用之一：测试、批评和验证公民用来创造知识的知识。关于谁应该统治他们的决定。因为这是大学的民主理由，所以对于那些想要捍卫大学的人来说，信息应该是明确的。只要学术自由被视为自由派精英的特权，它就没有学术界以外的支持者。自由主义者应该捍卫学术自由，不是将其视为职业特权，也不是将大学视为进步观点的堡垒，而是因为大学——就像法院、自由新闻界和独立监管机构——是对多数人统治的基本限制，而多数人统治使我们所有人都享有自由。这正是布达佩斯公民在走过 CEU 大门时所理解的，高呼“自由国家，自由大学”。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 06 Aug 2023 12:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

Crosswords]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>求解者必须对哪些条目是可能的以及如何获得线索有强烈的直觉。 <br><figure><img

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>本·科特/大西洋月刊</figcaption></figure>尽管没有人教过你，但如果你解决了很多填字游戏，你就很可能会流利地掌握填字游戏的语法。大多数填字游戏爱好者都可以解释名词线索名词、动词线索动词等等。他们还潜意识地知道，答案必须与句子中的线索可以互换，即使对于过于特殊而无法命名的类别也是如此。<br><br>这些不言而喻的原则可能非常复杂。考虑一下如何用“aplenty”而不是“many”来提示“GALORE”。这是因为，即使你可能把它们都称为形容词，但只有<em>galore</em>和<em>aplenty</em>出现在它们修饰的名词后面（而大多数其他英语形容词出现在前面）。此外，只需填写足够多的谜题，我们的大脑就可以了解到，多词填字游戏答案必须形成语言学家所说的句法成分——一组作为一个完整单元一起发挥作用的单词，就像<em>安全和可靠的</em>方式一样，但<em>安全和</em>不安全的方式&#39;t。<br><br>填字游戏的规则是解决这些问题的人所共享的一套丰富约定的一部分，并且它们与一般语言的语法密切相关。正如幼儿在不被教导什么是名词或动词的情况下就可以深入了解不同类别的单词一样，填字游戏解谜者也会对可能的条目以及如何找到它们产生强烈的直觉。这些直觉可以帮助您知道什么是一个好的答案，例如 OPRAH（ <em>《纽约时报》</em> 2019 年拼图中的“Harpo Productions 创始人”）、WHO GOES THERE（2018 年的“哨兵查询”）和 BANANA SPLIT（“甜点”）在船上服务，”根据 2022 年的条目）。<br><br>但填字游戏解谜者轻松熟悉规则的真正标志是知道什么是<em>糟糕的</em>答案，例如 SUPERB PAN（“煎培根的好东西”）或 ORDER A RYE（“威士忌爱好者会在酒吧做什么”） ）。这些无用的东西来自 Trip Payne 的作品，Trip Payne 是一位填字游戏构建者和快速解题者，以其荒诞的“布谷鸟填字游戏”而闻名。佩恩的布谷鸟填字游戏（故意）充满了如此滑稽怪异的条目，以至于解谜者会同意它们在典型的谜题中没有位置。 2021 年的一个谜题包含线索“‘原钻’片场的虚荣心。”答案：亚当·桑德勒的自我。<br><br>尽管像 SAFE AND 这样的条目会藐视英语的基本规则，但 Cuckoo Crosswords 中的 cuckoo 条目却藐视了填字游戏中更微妙（如果同样重要）的规则。在这两种情况下，填字游戏解决者都通过经验了解到什么使给定的条目可以接受或布谷鸟，以及什么使某些条目真正伟大。尽管这些规则是填字游戏所特有的，但它们依赖于更普遍的语言直觉——关于你大脑中来之不易的语言知识，尽管你可能从未有意识地思考过它。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/calebs-inferno-crossword-puzzle/">玩：迦勒的地狱填字游戏</a><br><br>像 ADAM SANDLER&#39;S EGO 这样的 Cuckoo 答案是完全有效的英语短语，可以很容易地替换句子中的线索，结构上与 PANDORA&#39;S BOX 或 ACHILLES&#39; HEEL 等更容易接受的条目相同。然而，由于难以言喻的原因，它们仍然不能令人满意。填字游戏构造函数为如下答案起了一个名字：ADAM SANDLER&#39;S EGO、SUPERB PAN 和 ORDER A RYE 都是“绿色油漆条目”——就像答案“绿色油漆”本身一样。<br><br>一些填字游戏专家认为，绿色油漆条目会令解题者感到厌烦，因为它们在普通语言中太罕见了。但如果你在日常生活中遇到<em>“点一杯黑麦”</em> （“你好，我想点一杯黑麦”），你不会三思而后行——事实上，根据你的兴趣，你听到这句话的可能性比完全可以接受的条目，例如 APSE。 “订购一杯黑麦”被主流填字游戏社会禁止的真正原因与所有人类语言的一个称为“组合性”的特征有关：将较小的含义组合成具有可预测含义的较大含义的能力。组合性可以让你理解多词短语（<em>绿色油漆</em>是绿色的油漆）以及你以前从未听过的句子，例如“Lady Gaga 用绿色油漆泼洒了填字游戏网格”。<br><br>组合性是人类语言的基石，让我们用有限的单词表达无限的想法。然而，对于填字游戏求解器来说，纯粹组合的短语往往会令人失望。像“GREEN PAINT”这样的答案并不令人满意，因为除了将这两个词融合在一起所获得的含义之外，它没有太多意义。相比之下，好的多词答案在某种程度上大于各个部分的总和。将 GREEN PAINT 与 GREEN DAY 进行比较（在 1996 年<em>《纽约时报》</em>的一个谜题中，由“与格莱美获奖专辑‘Dookie’组成的乐队”找到线索），后者无论如何都不是指绿色的一天。语言学家称这样的短语为“非组合性”，因为你必须了解它们作为短语的含义——仅仅通过组合各个部分是无法获得整体的含义的。<br><br>与填字游戏不同，组合性并不是非黑即白的：短语可以是完全组合性的、完全非组合性的，也可以是介于两者之间的一切。考虑绿茶（ <em>《纽约时报》</em> 2003 年的一个谜题，“一杯寿司”）。它是茶，而且是绿色的（有点）。但了解这两个事实并不能告诉您有关绿茶的所有信息。它也有独特的品味、自己的历史、自己的共鸣。在红茶中加入绿色食用色素可能会将其变成绿茶，但不会使其成为绿茶。<br><br>对于填字游戏答案，相同的逻辑也适用于单个单词。诸如 REBROIL（ <em>re</em> plus <em>broil</em> ，大概意思是“再次烤”）之类的纯粹组合答案比 RETURN 这样的词更容易引起求解者的愤怒。尽管<em>return</em>和<em>rebroil</em>一样，是由片段（ <em>re</em>和<em>turn</em> ）组成的，但它的含义并不完全由这些片段的含义单独决定：返回不仅仅是再次翻转的行为。<br><br>对于一个真正出色的填字游戏答案来说，它应该像普鲁斯特的玛德琳蛋糕一样，唤起特定的时间、地点或环境。这就是为什么完全组合的答案往往会失败：如果一个单词或短语是当场组成的，它就没有机会做到这一点。您可能与 REBROIL 或 GREEN PAINT 没有特别的联系，因为它们没有自己的生命。但最喜欢的甜点（融化的巧克力蛋糕）或艺术家（蒂娜·特纳）或技术（MACBOOK PRO）可能会唤起整个世界的先前经历。当我们遇到这些单词和短语时，我们会记住它们的现实生活背景，甚至它们的情感共鸣。<br><br>这种地方感可以为短语增添一层额外的乐趣，这些短语乍一看似乎没有任何意义或联想，除了通过组合单词所获得的意义或关联。以<em>《纽约时报》</em> 2022 年 Kameron Austin Collins 谜题中的“SO RANDOM”条目为例。就其本身而言，它的意思是“特别混乱”。但许多求解者都知道，这句话深深地体现了时代精神。 SO RANDOM 唤起了千禧一代的形象，也许是讽刺或谦虚地描述他们自己的行为，甚至可能是用<em>《独领风骚》</em>中角色的声音说话。这些假设得到了线索的进一步支持：“就像……到处都是。”与此同时，诸如“特别混乱”之类的答案将没有机会利用任何类型的文化背景。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/puzzling-art-print-crossword/674649/">阅读：谜题的艺术</a><br><br>近年来，新一波的构建者和编辑者拓宽了填字游戏寻找答案的文化背景。当今最受欢迎的填字游戏中包含的晦涩难懂的欧洲河流少于名人、典故和各行各业的语言片段。 “你的策展声音越多，网格中反映的世界就越多，”为<em>《纽约客》</em>构建谜题的纳坦·拉斯特（Natan Last）在给我们的信中写道。如今，这些策展人的声音包括朱莉安娜·帕奇（Juliana Pache）和内特·卡丁（Nate Cardin）和内特·卡丁（Nate Cardin）和内特·卡丁（Nate Cardin），朱莉安娜·帕奇（Juliana Pache）的黑色填字游戏让 MENTO 不再是硬糖，而是“后来影响了斯卡和雷鬼的牙买加民间音乐”，而内特·卡丁（Nate Cardin）和他的同事则经常强调 LGBTQ 主题。例如，克莱尔·里姆库斯 (Claire Rimkus) 和安德鲁·金斯利 (Andrew Kingsley) 设计的 2019 年谜题是围绕答案 AUTOSTRADDLE（一本酷儿女权主义在线杂志的名称）构建的。<br><br>填字游戏揭示了复杂的心理过程，不仅涉及将单词组合成短语，还涉及将字母组合成单词。与我们大多数书面语言的经验不同，填字游戏的答案是没有空格的，作为密集、互连的网格中的单个条目。一些很棒的填字游戏答案充分利用了这一事实。想象一下，您正在解决一个难题，并偶然发现了这两个六个字母、部分填充的条目之一：XG____ 或 ____DJ。任何求解器在看到这些奇怪的字母组合后，都会合理地认为他们一定是弄错了其中一个交叉词——毕竟，没有任何英语单词以<em>xg-</em>开头或以<em>-dj</em>结尾。但在这些情况下，答案 XGAMES（“明显拒绝对参与者进行药检的体育赛事”，来自 2022 年<em>《纽约时报》的</em>一个谜题）和 PBANDJ（“简称为午餐盒项目”，来自 2003 年）都完全符合网格。<br><br>因为语言处理是自动发生的，除非您正在解决填字游戏，否则您可能不会注意到 PBANDJ 当粉碎在一起时看起来非常奇怪。或者，就此而言，绿茶不仅仅是绿茶。也许这就是填字游戏如此吸引人的部分原因：它们为我们的语言直觉提供了一个新颖的游乐场。正如填写一个字母可以突然让我们努力回忆起来的答案变得显而易见一样，解决填字游戏可以打开一扇新的窗口，让我们了解我们头脑中已有的知识。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Sun, 06 Aug 2023
