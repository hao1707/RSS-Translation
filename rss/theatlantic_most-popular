<br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/Oa8Xp0-N06sX4TTtsJiur4KfUMk=/0x0:1920x1080/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/tiktok_live_/original.gif" alt="TikTok风格的动画硬币"

TikTok Coins 向他发送数字礼物，这种货币允许用户通过购买有趣的数字图标（星星、猫头鹰、校车、玫瑰）来有效地向他们最喜欢的创作者发送现金。随着圣诞颂歌的背景音乐和提示的滚滚而来，圣诞老人会开怀大笑来感谢发件人。他似乎从不谈论鲁道夫、克劳斯夫人或北极。事实上，他根本不怎么谈论圣诞节——他太忙于推广他的仅限订阅者的聊天。 “太有趣了！”他说。<br><br>圣诞老人的表演远非 TikTok 直播平台上最奇怪的事情。我花了几个小时滚动浏览应用程序中的专用选项卡，我所看到的完全重新配置了我对 TikTok 的理解。一个人每次收到礼物都会打自己一巴掌。另一个人则用 9,999,999,999,999 的计数器来怂恿观众，这个数字低于他 10 万亿美元的目标：某些礼物会导致数字下降；其他人则将其提升。 （当一位观众将他的收视率螺旋式下降至 9,999,999,999,919 时，他假装很失望。）“睡眠影响者”直播自己的睡眠—— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.insider.com/tiktok-sleepfluencers-help-people-with-insomnia-fall-asleep-2022-12">有时每月能赚数万美元</a>——而销售人员则兜售假发、水晶和快时尚，QVC 风格，全天候。如果你送礼物，名字骗子会以各种令人愉悦的方式在屏幕上写下你的名字。我最近花了几美分把我的名字烧成一根冰棒棒。这就像划一根火柴，注意力的闪光。然后就结束了。我一扫而空。<br><br> TikTok Live 是这个大型应用程序的独特部分，尽管该算法偶尔会在应用程序的主要提要中显示直播内容。上个月，蒙特利尔 27 岁的主播 PinkyDoll 因她的非玩家角色（NPC）作品而走红，许多不使用 TikTok 的人第一次在 Live 上看到了这种文化。她假装是电子游戏中的背景角色，直到观众送给她礼物，这让她充满活力。 PinkyDoll 以机器人般的精准度一遍又一遍地说着“冰淇淋真好吃”之类的话， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/17/style/pinkydoll-social-media-livestream.html">每次直播给她带来了高达 3,000 美元的收入</a>，通常<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/15-minutes-with-pinkydoll-the-npc-streamer-baffling-the-internet">每次直播一到两个小时</a>。 NPC 流媒体遍布“实时”选项卡，但它仅代表任意特定时刻正在展开的内容的一小部分。<br><br>直播环节是一场不间断的线上狂欢。它很奇怪、很华丽、很繁琐、很混乱——而且它也是一门大生意。市场分析师估计，用户可能会在那里花费数十亿美元。对于很多人来说，TikTok 可能意味着很多东西<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/04/montana-bill-bans-tiktok/673774/">——国家安全威胁</a>、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/06/your-tiktok-feed-embarrassing/619257/">读心术</a>、 <a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2020/09/tiktok-teens-fandom-mooptopia/616371/">青少年才艺表演</a>——但有一件事是确定的：它的所有者字节跳动正在积极地将这个平台融入到自己的互联网子经济中， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/tiktok-shopping-app-now/674845/">其中</a>在最奇怪的情况下<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/07/tiktok-shopping-app-now/674845/">出售产品</a>并获得财富。 “舞蹈视频”可能是该应用强大的 For You feed 的典型内容，但这只是 TikTok 的一小部分；如今，这些通过算法提供服务的点滴感觉更像是一个钩子，将用户拉入一个庞大的市场，在那里，金钱易手，让应用程序受益，从而使这一切发生。毕竟，字节跳动会从送给圣诞老人的每一份礼物中分得一杯羹：一位发言人告诉我，在扣除费用后，字节跳动将收入与创作者按 50-50 分成。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/03/dead-dog-tiktok-algorithm-pet-loss-grief/673445/">阅读：请让我摆脱死狗 TikTok</a><br><br>这对于平台来说意味着一大笔钱。根据应用分析公司 Data.ai 的数据，今年早些时候，TikTok 成为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/news/tiktok-surpasses-1-billion-in-consumer-spending-in-a-single-quarter/">首个单季度消费者支出超过 10 亿美元的应用</a>。为此，它击败了 Candy Crush 和 Roblox 等大型游戏应用程序。其中很大一部分支出源于 TikTok Live：根据 Data.ai 的数据，美国 99% 以上的应用内购买收入来自人们购买 TikTok 币，这种货币用于向创作者赠送礼物。那些礼物，TikTok <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/legal/page/global/coin-policy-eea/en">谨慎注意</a>，不要直接赋予货币价值；相反，它们会为创作者的整体“受欢迎程度”得分做出贡献，从而为他们赢得钻石——另一种可以<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/creators/creator-portal/en-us/getting-paid-to-create/live-gifting/">兑现</a>为实际货币的游戏化货币。 （尽管人们可以在常规 TikTok 视频中向创作者赠送礼物，但大多数代币都用于直播礼物。）市场情报公司 Sensor Tower 估计，自该应用推出以来，全球消费者已在 TikTok 代币上花费了 90 亿美元。当通过苹果的应用商店或谷歌的 Play 商店进行购买时，这些公司会收取<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/16/google-play-drops-commissions-to-15-from-30-following-apples-move-last-year/">佣金</a>：创作者为 TikTok 赚钱，而 TikTok 为科技巨头赚钱。<br><br>在 TikTok 上送礼物非常便宜，而且最重要的是，非常简单。一种流行的礼物是数字玫瑰，它的价格是一枚硬币，或者一美分左右，<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tiktok.com/coin">具体取决于您购买的套餐</a>。更昂贵的礼物，例如牛仔帽，将花费您 199 个硬币，即大约 2 美元。影响者营销公司 Ubiquitous 的竞选策略师扎克·菲奇 (Zach Fitch) 认为，这些低价吸引了原本不愿意为内容付费的用户。从本质上讲，它们是微交易：适用于数百万廉价手机游戏的“花完就忘记”精神的例子。 “我认为，它只是鼓励人们进行非常非常小的微交易，让他们感觉自己没有真正做任何事情，”菲奇告诉我。 “他们正在和朋友一起玩得很开心或大笑。”<br><br>从文化角度来看，TikTok Live 的支出似乎与其他直播平台上的支出有所不同。 Twitch 允许其创作者通过一个名为<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/guide-to-cheering-with-bits?language=en_US">Bits</a>的类似系统从粉丝那里获得提示，但那里的动态从根本上植根于粉丝圈：你观看某个主播玩<em>《使命召唤》</em>几个小时；你用一些现金支持他们。在 TikTok 上，您随时可以滑动到下一个内容：互动可以快速且具有事务性。你要花几美分请一个人（有时是在镜头外）用草书写下你的名字。它可以是任何人、任何地方。你花钱是为了娱乐。<br><br>因此，将这些付款称为“小费”并不完全正确。你不提供小费；你要为一点点关注或一点控制权而预先付出代价。你不会给直播主播小费，因为你喜欢看他们戳破一个巨大的水气球；你给他们一朵数字玫瑰，其明确的目的是向未爆开的水气球中添加更多的水——一遍又一遍，直到水气球膨胀成附近的针并爆炸。观众是表演的一部分。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/03/tv-politics-entertainment-metaverse/672773/">摘自 2023 年 3 月号：我们失去了情节</a><br><br>我们如此渴望参加这个节目可能看起来很新鲜，但事实并非如此。康奈尔大学传播系教授布鲁克·艾琳·达菲 (Brooke Erin Duffy) 表示，<em>美国偶像</em>等真人秀节目宣扬了一种“民主化精神”，大型媒体公司允许“普通观众参与其中”。告诉我。互联网时代的新媒体公司同样为我们提供了一些代理权、顶嘴的机会。无论是在 TikTok 上还是在 TikTok 之外，直播都建立在这种参与性传统的基础上。作为观众，“我们不想袖手旁观，”达菲解释道。 “我们想参加比赛。”<br><br><br>我的同事梅根·加伯<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/03/tv-politics-entertainment-metaverse/672773/">最近指出</a>，我们生活在一个“沉浸式娱乐”的时代，我们希望一切都充满娱乐。这一点在 TikTok Live 上最为明显，创作者们不停地工作，试图尽可能长时间地吸引观众的注意力。一方面，Live 似乎为创作者提供了一种将其作品货币化的新方式；另一方面，当你看到人们为了一分钱而辛勤工作时，你很难不感到有点拘谨。但也许我们都忙着花钱请人把我们的名字刻在冰棍棒上而没有注意到。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 21:47:43

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/us-religious-affiliation-rates-declining/672729/">写道</a>：“沿着该国几乎所有主要城市的主街行驶，随着房地产市场的停滞，你可能会看到更多的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://religionnews.com/2022/03/15/thousands-of-churches-close-every-year-what-will-happen-to-their-buildings/">待售教堂</a>而不是房屋。”事实证明了这一景象：季刊<i>《纯粹正统》</i>的主编杰克·米多尔 (Jake Meador) 在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/christian-church-communitiy-participation-drop/674843/">最近的一篇文章</a>中指出，在过去 25 年里，大约有 4000 万美国人不再去教堂。 “这大约占总人口的 12%，这是美国历史上教堂出席率最大的集中变化，”他写道。<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-great-dechurching-who-s-leaving-why-are-they-going-and-what-will-it-take-to-bring-them-back-jim-davis/9780310147435?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>大除教会</i></a>，<i> </i>即将出版的新书分析了两位政治学家对 7,000 多名美国人进行的调查，试图找出为什么近年来有这么多美国人离开教堂。作者发现，宗教滥用和腐败确实在促使参加者离开的过程中发挥了作用，但受访者中更大比例的人表示，他们“出于更平庸的原因”离开了教堂，正如米多尔所说：<br><br><p>这本书指出，驱逐大多数离开者的决定性问题是……21世纪美国人的生活是如何运作的。当代美国根本就不是为了促进相互、关怀或共同生活而设立的。相反，它旨在最大限度地提高职业和财务成功所定义的个人成就。这样的制度给各种形式的社区留下了宝贵的时间和精力，而这些社区对一个人自己的职业生活没有贡献，或者随着年龄的增长，对自己孩子的职业前景没有贡献。</p>正如米多尔指出的，部分问题在于宗教在一些美国人的生活中扮演着不同寻常的角色。 <i>《大西洋月刊》</i>作家德里克·汤普森 (Derek Thompson) 在 2019 年创造了<i>“工作主义”</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/02/religion-workism-making-americans-miserable/583441/">一词</a>，并诊断自己是一名受其束缚的工人。 “20 世纪初的经济学家没有预见到工作可能会从物质生产手段演变为身份生产手段，”汤普森当时写道。 “他们没有预料到，对于穷人和中产阶级来说，工作仍然是必需品；但对于受过大学教育的精英来说，它将演变成一种宗教，承诺身份、超越和社区。”<br><br>汤普森指出，工作主义并没有兑现这些承诺：“我们的工作从来就不是为了承担信仰的重担，它们在重压下不堪重负。根据<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.gallup.com/services/190118/engaged-workplace.aspx">盖洛普 (Gallup) 的</a>调查，高达 87% 的员工没有投入到工作中。这个数字逐年上升。”即便如此，对于那些将工作视为生活指导原则的人来说，其他优先事项可能很快就会被抛在一边。 “对许多人来说，潜在的挑战是他们的生活就像一根即将折断的橡皮筋一样被拉伸，而去教堂最终感觉就像是清单上已经太长的一项，”米多尔写道。<br><br>米多尔认为，问题的核心不仅仅是去教堂，而是美国社会已经变成什么样子：<br><br><p>我们面前的问题并不是我们有一个健康、可持续发展的社会，却没有教会的空间。问题在于，许多美国人所采用的生活方式让我们感到孤独、焦虑，并且不确定如何与其他人一起生活。</p>米多尔的观点让我想起了我们播客<i>《如何与人交谈</i>》中我最喜欢的一<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2023/05/social-infrastructure-public-space-community-relationships/674157/">集</a>，其中主持人讨论了公共空间在建设社区中的作用。咖啡店、教堂和图书馆等场所可以作为真正的共享空间，人们可以在这里交流并结交新朋友。但主持人朱莉·贝克指出，即使在这些地方，“我也观察到……一片喧嚣。”人们“肩负着使命”。她和制片人丽贝卡·拉希德（Rebecca Rashid）所说的“美国效率文化”使得我们没有动力慢慢来，坐下来结识新朋友。贝克与米多的观点相同：许多美国人似乎已经忘记了如何彼此建立真正经过深思熟虑的社区。<br><br>到目前为止，我对美国社区和灵性的未来描绘了一幅相当负面的图画，无论一个人可能遵守什么宗教或习俗。但一种竞争趋势也在悄然兴起：一些美国人正在改写有意或精神生活的规则。正如温迪·卡奇和<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/elan-babchuck/">埃兰·巴布查克</a>一月份在<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2023/01/us-religious-affiliation-rates-declining/672729/">指出的</a>那样，教堂出席率等指标可能不再是衡量美国宗教信仰的最准确指标。 “虽然对传统宗教场所（教堂、犹太教堂、清真寺、学校等）的参与在下降，但其他地方却出现了生机的迹象：在与牧师的对话中，在网上建立的社区中，最终也形成了面对面的联系，在根植于共同信仰的社会正义团体中，”他们写道。<br><br>米多则在读完<i>《伟大的去教会》</i>后，为教会找到了一种雄心勃勃的方式，让美国人重新回归教会。他认为，也许教会可以通过向成员提出更多要求来更好地为他们的成员服务：<br><br><p>一个充满活力、赋予生命的教会需要其成员更多而不是更少的时间和精力。它要求人们将彼此置于事业之上，将祈祷和阅读经文的时间置于成就之上……教会可以塑造更好、更真实的社区，让饥饿者得到食物，弱者得到鼓舞，骄傲者得到铸造向下。</p>对于任何社区来说，创造一种人们可以互相要求更多、反过来给予更多的环境似乎都是一条明智的经验法则。如果美国的生活没有让这样的前景变得如此令人畏惧就好了。<br><br><b>有关的：</b><br><br><li>

“我猜病人刚刚站起来就死了，”他说。<br><br>我是一名医院病理学家；我的职业是试图解释生命终结的众多职业之一。在这个角色中，我一次又一次地了解到，即使是最彻底的体检也会留下不确定性。以目前夏季<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://meridian.allenpress.com/aplm/article/130/9/1297/459980/Hypothermia-and-Hyperthermia-Medicolegal">尸检结果</a>可以明确诊断热死。受害者可能被发现患有体温过高（异常高的体温），或者他们可能被扔进更主观的“环境热应激”死亡者类别中。<br><br>很少有死亡事件首先经过如此广泛的法医检查。大多数时候，情况看起来很简单——75 岁的老人中风了；吸烟者因慢性肺病恶化而死亡，患者的初级保健医生或医院医生自行填写死亡证明。但高温却会悄无声息地使许多已有的病症恶化。压抑的温度会导致已经功能失调的器官衰竭。中国最近的一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.122.063504">研究</a>估计，在持续数天的严重热浪期间，心脏病死亡率可能上升高达 74%。美国的另一项 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cell.com/med/fulltext/S2666-6340(21)00377-9">研究</a>发现，即使是日常的温度波动也会微妙地改变肾功能、胆固醇水平和血细胞计数。医生无法轻易找出这些影响。如果一位坐在公园长椅上的老人在 90 华氏度的天气里突然因心脏病发作而瘫倒在地，很难确定是否是因为高温造成的。流行病学家必须出手救援，利用统计数据来揭示这些隐藏的原因在人口层面。这张鸟瞰图显示了一个简单的事实：恶劣的天气意味着<a data-event-element="inline link"

（人类在没有青霉素的情况下存活了数千年，但梅毒仍然是净阴性。）同样，当新冠病毒成为美国<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2022/s0422-third-leading-cause.html">第三大死因</a>时，大流行怀疑论者<a

<i>。</i><br><br>值得注意的对话<br><br>在美国最进步的飞地之一，有关犯罪的普遍公众讨论已经被颠覆，一个著名的民权组织已经受够了。在加利福尼亚州奥克兰，全国有色人种协进会当地分支机构上周发布了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blog.simplejustice.us/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/naacp-op-ed-7272023.pdf">一封措辞严厉的关于犯罪的公开信</a>，旨在反映社区中许多人现在生活在恐惧之中的挫败感。<br><br>奥克兰全国有色人种协进会主席辛西娅·亚当斯和当地牧师鲍勃·杰克逊主教被列为这封信的作者。它始于：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">奥克兰居民对我们难以忍受的公共安全危机感到厌倦，这种危机对少数族裔社区产生了压倒性的影响。谋杀、枪击、暴力武装抢劫、入室盗窃、入室盗窃、杂耍和高速公路枪战已成为奥克兰生活中普遍存在的现象。我们呼吁所有民选领导人团结起来，宣布进入紧急状态，并汇集大量资源来解决我们的公共安全危机。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">在东奥克兰和该市其他地区，非裔美国人受到的犯罪打击最为严重。但该市各地的居民都表示，他们感到不安全。在市中心和住宅区，妇女成为年轻暴徒的目标，遭到恶毒的殴打和抢劫。亚洲人在唐人街遭到袭击。弗鲁特韦尔的街头小贩遭到抢劫。新闻工作人员在报道犯罪事件时相机被盗。 PG&amp;E 工人在外出工作时遭到抢劫，现在需要私人保安。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">每个人都处于危险之中。</p>这封信将这场危机归咎于地方领导层及其进步政策，并指出：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">失败的领导，包括取消警察经费的运动、我们的地方检察官不愿指控和起诉谋杀和犯下危及生命的严重罪行的人，以及反警察言论的扩散，为奥克兰犯罪分子创造了一个鼎盛时期。如果奥克兰的犯罪行为不承担后果，犯罪率将继续飙升。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">人们正成群结队地搬出奥克兰。他们不敢冒险走出家门去奥克兰工作、购物或就餐，这正在破坏经济活动。企业，无论大小，都在挣扎和倒闭，税收消失，我们正在创造一个臭名昭著的末日循环，我们城市的生活继续螺旋式下降。随着经济痛苦的加剧，没有就业机会的绝望人们加剧了犯罪和罪犯的滋生条件。</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;">我们正处于危机之中，当选的领导人必须宣布进入紧急状态，并汇集市、县和州的资源来结束危机。我们还差 500 名警察，比专家所说的奥克兰需要的数量还少。我们的 911 系统不起作用。居民们现在知道，当他们遇到危险时，援助不会到来。更糟糕的是，犯罪分子也知道这一点。</p>作者呼吁建立一个多种族反犯罪联盟，并暗示潜在的此类联盟成员因过于害怕而不敢组建联盟：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">我们敦促非裔美国人大声疾呼，要求改善公共安全。我们还鼓励奥克兰的白人、亚裔和拉丁裔社区大声疾呼反对犯罪，不要让自己因羞愧而保持沉默。允许犯罪行为恶化并剥夺奥克兰居民公共安全的基本权利，这既不具有同情心，也不具有进步性。想要免受犯罪侵害并不是种族主义或不友善的行为。</p>它还倡导社会计划和经济发展，以解决犯罪的根源：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">必须为我们的年轻人提供替代方案，以摆脱导致犯罪、毒品和监狱的严重绝望。他们需要优质的教育、指导，最重要的是，真正的经济机会。奥克兰应该专注于创造熟练的工业和物流工作，以支付家庭维持工资，并进行职业培训，以便奥克兰居民能够从事这些工作。有了这个重点，我们就可以创造数百种（如果不是数千种）遏制经济绝望急需的工作类型。不幸的是，进步的政策和失败的领导已经赶走了或推迟了该市、奥克兰港和前陆军基地的重要蓝领就业发展。这必须改变！我们还必须继续开展指导计划，例如国家 OK 计划奥克兰分部，引导青少年远离犯罪活动。我们相信，如果给目前处于犯罪生活中的年轻人指明一条路，他们会选择另一条路。</p>作为对这封信的回应，阿拉米达县地方检察官办公室向当地媒体<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/oakland-naacp-crime-letter-18266709.php">发表了</a>以下声明：“我们对一位伟大的非裔美国牧师和一个伟大的非裔美国组织在如此重要的问题上采取虚假叙述感到失望。我们对鲍勃·杰克逊主教和全国有色人种协进会奥克兰分会期待更多。”<br><br>在评论全国有色人种协进会的信时，民事自由主义刑事辩护律师斯科特·H·格林菲尔德（Scott H. Greenfield）在他的博客“简单正义”中<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blog.simplejustice.us/2023/07/31/the-streets-of-oakland/">指出</a>，“想要更好的警察，尊重公民，不侵犯他们的宪法权利，不侵犯他们的宪法权利，这并没有什么矛盾之处。”不要诉诸不必要的暴力，并希望警察做好保护公民的工作。”他继续：<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">没有人愿意被警察错误地殴打。也没有人愿意被恶毒的罪犯殴打。没有人希望那些有犯罪倾向的人相信他们可以这样做而不受惩罚，无论是因为经济状况并不像拜登经济学告诉他们的那么好，还是仅仅因为犯罪是获得他们想要的东西比为之工作更快的途径。 ……当街上的人们生活在对犯罪的恐惧之中时，他们的生活是悲惨的，他们对社会的参与也受到限制。 They don&#39;t want to live that way, and the Oakland NAACP has stood up to speak for its constituency. This doesn&#39;t make them cop lovers or reform haters, but human beings trying to survive together. Cops are part of that survival, and to accept this does not mean that cops can&#39;t, and shouldn&#39;t, do a whole lot better than they have in the past.</p> The <em>Boston Globe</em> columnist Jeff Jacoby <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/08/02/opinion/jeff-jacoby-oakland-naacp-defund-police/">writes</a> :<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;"> Each year, tens of thousands of Oakland residents are victimized in criminal attacks. Preventing shoplifting, car jackings, armed robberies, and homicides is not a conservative or a liberal goal. It is why governments exist in the first place.</p> <strong>The Road Not Taken</strong><br><br> At Notes From the Middleground, Damon Linker is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://damonlinker.substack.com/p/please-stop-cheering">considering</a> the newest indictment of Donald Trump with trepidation for the future and frustration about a key moment in the recent past:<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;"> Short of an intervening (possibly stress-induced) medical event, Trump is going to be the Republican nominee for president. He will be running for the nation&#39;s highest office while on trial for multiple crimes in multiple jurisdictions. His campaign will take direct aim at the rule of law, declaring it a sham fit only for saps, suckers, and chumps, and most Republican voters will fall in line with this sordid civic lesson, just as most Republican voters have come to believe the 2020 election was stolen by the Democrats simply because Trump has said it was.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;"> Trump could well be convicted in one or more of these trials before Election Day 2024. And he could well win the election, sending him to the White House instead of federal prison. Far from vindicating the rule of law, such an outcome would make a mockery of it.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;"> And what if he loses, claiming once again to have been robbed of a victory by a vast conspiracy involving the Democratic Party, prosecutors and the courts, ostensibly neutral government functionaries, and the “fake news” media that will stop at nothing to deny power to the nearly half of the country that dares to resist left-wing totalitarian control? I won&#39;t try to answer that question. Your imaginations can do the work all on their own.</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;"> I&#39;ll leave you with something else instead—my growing conviction is that the last opportunity we had to contain and partially neutralize the civically pestilential influence of Donald Trump on our polity was February 13, 2021. That&#39;s the day Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell voted to acquit Donald Trump for his actions on and leading up to the events of January 6. While <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/13/politics/mitch-mcconnell-acquit-trump/index.html">describing</a> Trump&#39;s words and deeds in the run-up to the insurrectionary violence on Capitol Hill as “disgraceful,” McConnell nonetheless preferred to let the judicial branch of government solve his Trump problem for him, declaring, “We have a criminal justice system in this country. We have civil litigation. And former presidents are not immune from being held accountable by either one.”</p><p style="margin-left:.5in;"> In the annals of shirked political responsibility, that has to deserve a special prize. It would have taken ten more votes in the Senate to convict Trump in his second impeachment. Had McConnell taken a public stand against the former president and whipped others in his party to do the same, Trump might have been barred from ever holding public office again. That would have been a political solution to what was and remains a fundamentally political problem. Instead, we&#39;re left with the legal solution McConnell preferred—and the considerable risk that politics may well overwhelm and devour it.</p> <strong>In Hot Water</strong><br><br> In <em>The Atlantic</em> , Marina Koren <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/08/marine-heat-waves-earth-climate-change/674892/">argues</a> that rising sea temperatures are especially troubling:<br><br><p style="margin-left:.5in;">地球是一个海洋星球，一个水世界。我们还没有在宇宙中观察到类似的东西，即使是用我们最好的望远镜也没有，所以我们无法确切地知道宇宙自然力量产生这样的东西是多么罕见，因此也有多困难。然而，我们却在这里冒着危险沸腾着海洋，并<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/25/climate/atlantic-ocean-tipping-point.html">改变了地球生态系统的基本构成</a>。近几十年来，我们的海洋吸收了温室气体排放产生的大部分多余热量，充当了保护我们免受气候变化最严重影响的缓冲区。今年夏天，人类在陆地上可能会感到闷热，但我们星球的未来（以及我们的未来）与海洋密切相关。</p><hr> <strong>Provocation of the Week</strong><br><br> Writing at <em>Law &amp; Liberty</em> , Yuval Levin <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://lawliberty.org/forum/constituting-unity/">explores</a> the relationship between America&#39;s constitutional design and our efforts to live together across differences.<br><br><p> Acting together when we don&#39;t think alike requires creating some space for competing approaches to governance; compelling opposing factions to bargain, negotiate, and seek accommodations that not only avert conflict but bring us closer together; administering the government in steady, predictable ways in accordance with those accommodations; and enforcing clear boundaries on the power of majorities and public officials. This is the work of federalism, Congress, the president, and the courts, respectively. But it all requires a citizenry well formed in core republican virtues by the very experience of working together even when we don&#39;t think alike.</p><p> This is a fact we often miss about our Constitution. It works by setting competing interests and powers against each other, which critics sometimes caricature as substituting an almost mechanical proceduralism for morally substantive civic formation. But that is precisely wrong. This approach actually begins from the insight that, in order to be properly formative, our politics must always be in motion—that moral formation is a matter of establishing habits, and that civic habits are built up by civic action more than by a proper arrangement of rules. The different interests, priorities, and power centers set against each other in our system do not rest against each other, like interlocking beams holding up a roof. Rather, they push, pull, and tug at each other and unceasingly compete for position. They are living political actors, not inanimate structural supports. And none can achieve anything without dealing with the others, who are always in their way. The result is a peculiar style of politics, which feels frustrating and acrimonious at almost any given instant, but can be remarkably dynamic in the long run.</p> <i data-stringify-type="italic">Thanks for your contributions.

(Tobin Heath) 和克里斯汀·普雷斯 (Christen Press) 提出了这个理论，尽管它很尴尬，他们主持了 YouTube 系列节目<em><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9qGpfsW-OA">《The RE-CAP Show》</a></em> 。她们都曾为国外职业球队和美国国家女子足球联盟效力。他们都是最近两届世界杯冠军球队的成员。毫不奇怪，他们不同意这个前提。<br><br> “不不不。我明白你想在那里做什么，”希思说。 “但是，不，绝对不。我仍然认为美国女足国家队不仅是增加女足投资的斗争的火炬手，也是全球薪酬公平的火炬手。我认为美国女子国家队的成功是这项运动全球第一的推动者。”<br><br>请听这里的对话：

NWSL（全国女子足球联盟）正在努力制定职业标准，让球员能够为国家队效力。<br><br>第九条以及大学课程的优势对于美国女子国家队的成功发挥了重要作用。随着这种情况的发展，我们的联盟确实有责任继续帮助球员发展并找到他们在国际水平上获胜所需的素质。<br><br>

已进入第 11 或第 12 年，这是惊人的。过去两个联赛都失败了。还没有超过五年。因此，即使看看这一进展，它也确实是独一无二的。每届世界杯，女足以及全球女子体育的格局都会发生巨大变化。<br><br>所以我们总是好奇会发生什么。我认为世界杯冠军也确实决定了这一点。 2015 年至 2019

<strong>Rosin：</strong>等等，你们真的认为什么事情都有可能发生吗？因为很有趣，现在的每一篇文章都是关于美国队将如何进行一场艰苦的战斗来赢得连续第三个冠军，因为其他球队正在迎头赶上。我不知道这是否只是让整件事变得有趣的原因。<br><br><strong>记者：</strong>哦，他们说每届世界杯。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>每届世界杯，如果你回顾每届世界杯的任何头条新闻。<br><br><strong>记者：</strong>但这也是事实。两者是同时进行的。我记得我的第一届世界杯。美国已经很久没有赢了，他们还在用这样的说辞：<em>哦，世界正在迎头赶上。</em><em>获胜将比以往任何时候都更加困难。</em><br><br>你知道，现在随着联赛在多个大洲取得成功，世界在投资方面正在迎头赶上。我认为随着奖金的不断增加，只会鼓励联合会继续投资，这将使锦标赛变得更好。<br><br>从我第一次参加世界杯到现在，我的最终感受是：太棒了，你想击败最好的球队。你希望每个人都处于最佳状态。我们并不是想赢得这届世界杯，因为我们是投入最多的球队。我们希望每个人都能投资。我们想赢得世界杯。<br><br>当你谈论三连冠时，这是一个非常有趣的现象，因为它与掷硬币时的情况是一样的。每次掷硬币时，赔率都会重置。但从情感上来说，对我来说，球队能够取得三连胜是不可思议的。<br><br>因为每一届世界杯，我都会说，<em>我们几乎不可能获胜。</em>它是如此艰苦。你必须完美。你必须有足够的运气在你身边。你必须有如此多的优秀。这几乎是不可能的。然后我们就会赢，我会说，<em>天哪。</em>比如说，那是深不可测的。因此，想象一下连续三次这样做，真是令人难以承受。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>哦，你知道，现在有一个可怕的大问题。鉴于你刚才所说的一切，也许这更好——我什至可以这么说吗？——我的意思是，我知道你们支持美国，我也支持美国，但也许对美国来说，这对全球女子足球更好，而不是赢？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>不，不，不，我明白你想做什么。但是，不，绝对不。我仍然认为美国女足国家队不仅是增加女足投资的斗争的火炬手，也是全球薪酬公平的火炬手。我认为美国女子国家队的成功是我们这项运动在全球范围内获得应有认可和投资的第一推动力。<br><br>我认为我们仍然是团队，下面的，那就是最伟大的。我认为我们仍然对这项运动的格局影响最大。所以我认为，尽管我们有时想为其他国家加油，但我认为对这项运动来说最好的事情实际上是美国女子国家队再次获胜。<br><br>我认为很多机会都来​​自于此，因为我们是谁以及我们代表什么。但是，正如克里斯汀所说，三连冠是疯狂的。不这样做会更具破坏性，因为那样你就会回到零，对吗？<br><br>就像很多年的历史一样，已经过去了。我不想让它重置。但是，是的，我们会看看会发生什么。我的意思是，每个人都说任何人都可以获胜。我认为，最终输球的是美国女足国家队。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>尽管如此，请纵容我一下，因为你们在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://re-website.com/pages/recapshow">节目</a>中进行辩论；再给我一轮辩论。如果是另一支球队获胜呢？令人惊讶的团队？<br><br>那就太令人兴奋了。然后女子运动就会在世界各地扎根，到处都会有很多人观看。然后，即使是美国运动员也会有很多地方可以去，这只会建立整个全球运动。克里斯汀，你觉得怎么样？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>我认为问题是你需要一些基础设施来实现变革，对吧？因此，英格兰就是一个很好的例子。因为英格兰联赛表现非常好，他们有机会迅速进入大型体育场，利用英格兰国家队在欧洲杯上取得的成功。<br><br>所以，当你问这个问题时，我的想法和托宾完全一样。由于我们对基础设施的投资，我们能够从胜利中获得最大收益。显然，作为美国人，我们也倾向于认为我们的新闻是全球新闻。但我认为球队的历史就是为变革而奋斗。这在美国女子国家队的文化中根深蒂固。我确实认为这种情况具有传染性，而且一直以来都具有传染性，其他国家也受到了我们一直在进行并取得胜利的斗争的鼓舞。<br><br>在某些时候，我们希望如此。我们在我们国家看到的变化，我们希望它能够迅速涌入所有国家。但我确实认为，实际上，我们处于继续产生最大影响的最佳位置。这只是因为有多少人报道它，有多少人在我们国家观看比赛，我们的联赛在哪里，我们必须在哪些体育场出售门票和商品——所有这些。<br><br>因为最终推动业务发展的是金钱，对吗？这就是美国能够实现变革并产生影响的原因——基础设施及其业务推动一切向前发展。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>是的。我想补充一点，我认为实际上可能发生的最糟糕的事情是，如果美国女足国家队输了，而英格兰队赢了。就基础设施而言。在克里斯汀看来，因为他们拥有扩大成功的基础设施。<br><br>我们已经在欧元上看到了这一点。他们仅仅从那场比赛中就取得了巨大的规模。凭借世界杯的规模，我认为这将真正彻底改变欧洲足球。我认为这将是一个真正的竞争优势，因为如果他们获胜，他们就代表了整个欧洲。如果我们赢了，我们就代表了我们和我们的统治地位。这完全是另一个等式。如果我们有这个播客的第 2 部分，您可以在那里观看。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>等等，但是托宾，你是说如果英国队赢了也一样好吗？因为他们有完全不同的模型。我知道你对这种模式有一些经验，他们隶属于这些传奇的男子俱乐部，比如曼联和阿森纳。我也想知道这样做的优点和缺点。这是促进和发展女子足球的神奇方式吗？还是这让他们处于男足的阴影之下？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>这是一个完全不同的模型。我更关心的是它是否具有很强的竞争力，但又是一种不同的竞争。我坚信女性团队的独立所有权。我们已经看到了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/07/womens-world-cup-soccer/674802/">天使之城的</a>成功。我坚信，如果你和男队在同一把伞下，你本质上永远是第二名。这真的很难进化出来。<br><br>在美国，对于女性来说，我们是第一运动。我们国家的男子足球可能排名第五？所以我认为独立对我们更有利，因为我认为我们国家的女性运动是第一，那么你为什么要模仿我们国家的第五运动呢？<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>是的。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>但在英国，我认为情况完全相反。事实上，我认为他们在男子球队的保护下有很多好处，因为结构，因为球迷基础，因为足球在那个国家的意义的历史。我认为，如果他们要赢得世界杯，那将是可怕的，他们在这些庞大的建筑中可能拥有的规模和潜力。因为即使她们的排名仅次于男性，这也是一个荒谬的规模。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>天哪，托宾，但现在我觉得那太好了。你会在海外拥有这样一个令人惊叹的大规模机会吗？我们会拥有伟大的美国团队并持续多年吗？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>小心点，听起来你可能是在支持英格兰队。<br><br><strong>松香：</strong> 【<em>笑。</em> ] 确切地。你知道，我很好奇，里面的体验是什么样的？公平地说，我认为你的意思是，该模式在英国行之有效。你可以明白为什么它在英国行之有效。我们的模式对我们来说效果很好，但是在一个团队中的内部体验是什么？附属于一家著名的男子俱乐部与美国天使城女子球队的经历？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>嗯，我会说我在曼联的时间是在欧洲杯之前，所以我实际上希望这家具乐部和大多数俱乐部都能取得跨越式发展。但我认为天使城也是一种独立的，因为它不仅仅是独立所有权；它是独立的。这是女性所有权。<br><br>因此，当我们在天使城谈论球员需求和球队需求时，谈话的本质是我从未经历过的，因为我正在和那些真正相信我的价值、我们的价值、球队的价值的人交谈。他们之所以从事这项工作，是因为他们想要创造和放大我们这项运动中存在的价值。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>等等。你能详细说明一下吗？就像你对曼联与天使城的做法有何看法？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>是的，我认为，总结一下：投资女性游戏的想法是因为这是<em>正确的</em>做法，我觉得很多男性高管都来自这个领域。而不是投资女子比赛，因为这是一个很棒的商业模式，将为球迷和利益相关者创造大量价值。<br><br>所以，你知道，曼联他们签下了我们。他们认识托宾和我。我们在争取公平和薪酬方面享有盛誉。他们有点知道自己会得到什么。公平地说，他们有一个与我们分享的关于为女性建造设施和成长的计划。<br><br>但这是我们一直听到的情绪。<em>哦，我正在这样做——我知道这是正确的做法。我这样做是为了我的女儿。这是正确的做法。</em>当你与天使城的卡拉·诺特曼和朱莉交谈时，他们这样做是因为他们相信这一点，因为他们相信这是一项伟大的商业举措。<br><br>他们相信我们都会崛起。这股浪潮将一起上涨。<br><br> <strong>[<em>音乐</em>]</strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>我们要短暂休息一下。当我们回来时：1999 年世界杯改变了这项运动。你猜怎么着？希斯和普雷斯都在那里。<br><br> <strong>[<em>音乐</em>]</strong><br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>我回想起你们刚开始的时候。所以，1999 年女足世界杯期间，你一定还不到十几岁，当时人们的兴趣爆发了，决赛在玫瑰碗举行，现场有 90,000 名观众，这是一个巨大的记录。那是你开始意识到足球的那一刻吗？<br><br>因为那一刻感觉你所描述的一切都将在红地毯上铺开。它即将发生。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>是的，当你谈论“11”、“15”、“19”以及所有美国女足世界杯决赛中的黄金一代时，你说得完全正确。 1999 年，我参加了美国女子国家队在新泽西州的首场比赛。克里斯汀参加了玫瑰碗决赛。<br><br>如果你实际上与美国女子国家队的大多数球员交谈过，他们要么参加了其中一场比赛，要么对那场比赛有一个非常震撼的故事。但我想这是我们所有人第一次睁开眼睛说：“哇，我想<em>这么做</em>。”<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>等等，你当时<em>在场</em>吗？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>我参加了揭幕战；克里斯汀进入了决赛。显然我们当时并不认识。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>那太大了。那么你是否认为：<em>哦，足球是一种职业。比如，我可以赚钱。这是我一生都可以专业做的事情吗</em>？<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>是的。这很有趣，因为我是一个非常自大的小孩。 [<em>笑。</em> 】 我还是个趾高气扬的小大人。但那是梅多兰兹，我记得在那里，我和我的足球队一起来，我在草地上踢球。我穿着米娅·哈姆的球衣。我们当时正在玩皮卡。<br><br>我记得当时我心里想——我想我当时只有 12 岁——比如：<em>哇，我现在已经足够优秀了，可以进入那个领域了。</em><br><br><strong>松香：</strong> 【<em>笑。</em> ] 棒极了。太棒了。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>我认为，拥有那种程度的兴趣和热情——当你走进那个体育场，你感受到那种能量，你往球场上看，你看到了一个你相信自己可以成为的榜样——是非常强大的。<br><br>这就是为什么，对于天使城来说，当你走进那个体育场时，性别完全消失了。我认为在那一刻，我们小时候都感受到性别已经完全消失了。这真是太棒了，这是我们未来可以拥有的机会。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong> Christen，你在 1999 年玫瑰碗决赛中的经历是什么？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>是的，实际上我有一张我和我的团队、我的姐妹们和我的脸画着的照片。当我看照片时，我可以在我的眼睛里看到它。我当时想：<em>我能做到。</em>我<em>当时</em>认为我做不到；我还没准备好。但我认为这就是梦想，那就是目标。<br><br>老实说，当我第一次被国家队征召时，我什至不知道这是一份有薪工作。我认为为国家队效力是一种荣幸，是一件令人惊奇的事情，你甚至不会得到报酬。这么说很尴尬，但我认为这很重要，因为即使是我们的球员协会在向世界进行体育教育方面也取得了如此大的进步。女性的经济解放对于我们所争取的社会进步极其重要。因此，希望永远不会有球员在离开时不知道他们所做的事情具有经济价值。<br><br>但对我来说[1999]只是心眼。看看那些在这个层面上受到充分重视、赞赏和庆祝的女性。那里有这么多人，这改变了我的生活，因为它绝对只是看到了我以前从未见过的照片。并看到有机会做一些事情，实现这个梦想并使其达到如此规模。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>我想说的是，就克里斯汀的观点而言，当我真正进入国家队时，我没有得到报酬，因为当我进入国家队时，我刚刚开始上大学。所以我什至没有想过进入国家队是为了拿薪水。对我来说，这只是一种荣誉。我想成为这个团队的一员，了解它的象征和作用。我的第一个世界冠军是 2008 年奥运会，我记得我所有的队友都非常兴奋，因为我加入了球队，因为这意味着如果我们赢了，他们会得到更多的奖金——因为我在大学时没有得到任何奖金运动员。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>天哪。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>所以他们说，<em>是的。很高兴托宾出现在名单上。</em><br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>你能否真正清楚地表达出来——这样听的人才能真正理解——当球员获得报酬时会产生什么不同。我知道这是一个疯狂的问题，但现在你看到人们得到报酬，过着真正的生活，这实际上改变了什么？<br><br><strong>按：</strong>嗯，它改变了一切。我们希望最好的球员、最好的运动员来完成这项工作。这就是推动游戏向前发展的原因。它必须是一种可持续的生活方式。你必须能够将自己的一生奉献给这项运动，并且有足够的钱来度过余生，这样它才能成为一项真正的职业运动。<br><br>因为当你在这些<em>我们得到报酬，但还不够的</em>情况下，我们仍在解决这个问题时，你总是会分心，你必须做其他事情或将你的时间和日子分开，以便赚足够的钱来生存。<br><br>我认为这只会降低这项运动的质量。我们整个职业生涯都在为下一代球员不需要再找工作，不需要在退役后工作，不需要担心职业生涯的到来而奋斗。最后，<em>我该如何继续赚钱？</em>他们不必在周末去诊所，也不必花几百美元去四小时外的诊所，因为他们需要额外的收入。这就是目标。目标是让职业女运动员成为职业运动员。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>是的。我认为这是新一代人必须应对的挑战。我认为我们这一代人中的很多人，我们为我们所得到的每一件事而奋斗，然后是这项运动的未来显然将得到的每一件事。真的感觉像是赚到了一些东西。我知道这样说很奇怪，但是当你从一个白手起家的模式转变为一个赢得同工同酬的模式时，现在这是美国女子国家队和男子国家队第一次在比赛开始之前就得到了同等的报酬，这感觉像是很多基础收入。<br><br>现在我看看这一代人，我认为这是新一代的女性职业运动员。他们面临着新的挑战，因为他们拥有这些个人品牌、这些个人代言，正如克里斯汀所说，这些真正改变了他们成为职业运动员的方式。这就是我们一直在推动的，对吧？<br><br>但他们没有我们为之奋斗的那种基本的收入意识。我认为这将带来一种不同类型的心态，并且这种心态必须通过美国女子国家队的这一过程而不断发展。<br><br>因为美国女足国家队的整体比任何一个部分都更伟大。现在这些零件变得更有价值了。那么各个部分的价值如何影响整体的价值呢？所以这会很有趣——看看未来会是什么样子。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>噢，我明白了。所以你的意思是你们必须作为一个团队来战斗。就像，你们有理由进行这种团结，因为你们正在为这些基本权利而奋斗。然而，这些参与者带着个人品牌——可能是社交媒体品牌、代言等——进来，所以他们在很大程度上是个人，所以他们的挑战是：那么，我们如何团结一致？<br><br> <strong>Heath：</strong>我的意思是，在这场比赛开始之前，他们中的大多数人已经赚到了比我们在 2015 年或 2019 年获胜时赚到的钱更多的钱。所以我们的收入实际上取决于团队的成功。因此，作为一名专业人士，现在的心态非常不同，我们必须观察结果如何。<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>对。因为除非你赢了，否则你们甚至不会得到报酬。就像他们会给你奖金一样，但整个团队都必须获胜。这与每个球员要取得的成就无关。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>没错。是的。<br><br><strong>记者：</strong>谈话中有趣的部分是：我们必须赢得世界杯才能赢得同工同酬，但我们是否需要争取同工同酬才能赢得世界杯？<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>嗯。<br><br> <strong>Press：</strong>显然，我们永远不会知道。但我认为每个观看 2019 年世界杯的人都会感觉到我们正在为比我们更伟大的目标而战。我们有这种外部动机，它是如此鼓舞人心、如此团结，以至于我——我是一个有精神的人；我相信这就是我们获胜的原因。我相信我们获胜是因为我们有代表世界各地女性的工作要做。<br><br>现在我们即将进入世界杯，必须有一种不同的无形资产。这场比赛并不是美国女子国家队争取同工同酬的斗争。那么它是什么？你是否需要外部动力来赢得这场比赛？<br><br><strong>罗辛：</strong>那真的很漂亮。我的意思是，那是什么？你们谈论这个吗？比如，你认为可以让他们走到一起的无形动力是什么？<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>我的意思是，他们正在为三连冠历史而战。是的。我认为棘手的是有什么？队里有五名球员真的——<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>确实是三连冠。<br><br><strong>媒体：</strong>是的，三连冠。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>所以是他们——他们必须用他们的目标激励每个人。<br><br><strong>希思：</strong>是的，球队正在为之奋斗，但实际上只有几个非凡的个人才能赢得三场胜利。其他人，两个，也许一个。但这很有趣。我喜欢你刚才所说的为更多的东西而奋斗。我认为作为一个团体和集体，你会围绕某件事团结起来。<br><br>我不知道那是什么，但我很确定如果这支球队一路进入决赛，我们就会看到它；我们就会知道那是什么东西。<br><br> <strong>Rosin：</strong>也许这只是为了梅根·拉皮诺（Megan Rapinoe）。也许这就像三连冠的拉皮诺一样。 [<em>笑。</em> 】 这样就够了。和你们聊天真是太有趣了。基本上，我想从这次谈话中学到的是学会观看这些比赛，并以你们俩的方式看待这个世界。我觉得你们是很棒的向导，我真的很感激。非常感谢你们俩。<br><br><strong>希斯：</strong>任何时候。<br><br>

referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>本·科特/《大西洋月刊》插图。 Source: Getty</figcaption></figure> T <span class="smallcaps">he month I moved</span> to Los Angeles felt apocalyptic, even by the standards of a city forever being destroyed in film. It was the end of the summer of 2020; stores were closed, streets empty, and wildfires had enveloped the region in smoke, turning the sky orange. Yet after I parked the U-Haul, things got even bleaker.<br><br> Walking to my new apartment, I passed a car where a 20-something had passed out with the engine running. Folks, I noticed, were sleeping in nearly every car on the street—a mix, I would later learn, of UCLA students and construction workers.<br><br> I had never encountered vehicular homelessness before moving out West. Indeed, it hadn&#39;t even registered to me as a possibility, as a thing one might do to avoid sleeping on the street. In New York City, most homeless people don&#39;t own cars, and in any case, the city has a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-02/new-york-city-s-right-to-shelter-mandate-for-homelessness-faces-new-test">legal obligation</a> to provide shelter. This is not true in California.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lahsa.org/data?id=54-homeless-count-by-city-community">Nearly 20,000 Angelenos</a> live in RVs, vans, or cars, a 55 percent increase over when the count first started, in 2016. As the housing shortage deepens, thousands more will likely be forced into this lifestyle. Many of these people do not have the mental-health or substance-abuse issues eagerly trotted out to dismiss the homelessness crisis. A significant minority have jobs—they&#39;re people who stock shelves or install drywall but simply can&#39;t afford a home.<br><br> Like most Angelenos, I was repulsed by the homelessness crisis, vehicular or otherwise. Early in the summer of 2021, I temporarily joined the 20,000. Amid COVID-19 lockdowns, I was paying half of my income for a bedroom in a shared student apartment furnished like a doctor&#39;s office waiting room. My lease was set to expire, and I had to travel for work, anyway. Moving into my Prius seemed like the best bad option.<br><br> A <span class="smallcaps">ngelenos love their cars</span> , the stereotype goes. Our city&#39;s distinctive natural wonder is, after all, the tar pits: Los Angeles wants to be paved over. And many see a certain American romance in a stretch of living, free and unencumbered, on the road.<br><br> Search YouTube for <em>living out of a Prius</em> and the first thing you&#39;ll <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NikkiDelventhal/videos">find</a> is a former <em>Bachelor</em> contestant and NFL cheerleader who has pulled in millions of views for her travels in a mint-green 2006 Prius. Hundreds of social-media accounts offer similar adventures. Their styles vary, but the pitch is consistent: Save money; see the country; live your best life.<br><br> Why the Prius in particular? Unlike vans or RVs, the Toyota hybrid offers escape at rock-bottom prices. A 10-year-old beat-up Prius can run as low as $7,500. The car enjoys minimal maintenance and high gas mileage, and thanks to the hybrid battery, you can leave it running overnight for heat or AC.<br><br> Online communities such as the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/priusdwellers/">r/priusdwellers</a> Subreddit celebrate novel builds—lifted <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/priusdwellers/comments/vje1kd/happiness_is_overlanding_with_your_lift_kit/">Priuses</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/priusdwellers/comments/sgt42v/hey_heres_how_i_installed_a_solar_panel_on_my_gen/">Priuses</a> with solar panels, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/priusdwellers/comments/pwrogr/my_humble_abode/">Priuses</a> with more storage than an IKEA showroom. But my <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RYCkSMMXtY">build</a> <u>was basic</u> : Drop the rear seats, stack a 28-quart container on a 54-quart container on the floor, and put a pillow on top to create a flat, six-foot-long clearing. Lay down a yoga mat, a mattress topper, and a sleeping pad, and you have a bed more comfortable than any hotel mattress. You can add rods for hanging curtains and clothes, a sunscreen and rain guards for privacy.<br><br> On my first day living out of my Prius, I whizzed up the Pacific Coast Highway before hopping over to the 101, which runs through the sleepy Salinas Valley of Steinbeck fame. As the sun started to set, I realized that I hadn&#39;t planned out where I was going to camp for the night and was forced to make my first rookie mistake: sleeping at a highway rest area.<br><br> The parking lot was packed with people living out of vehicles—truckers in semis, middle-class retirees in RVs, Millennials in tricked-out vans, and quite a few people in cars poorly suited to vehicle living, with stacks of luggage filling passenger seats and shirts pinched into closed windows to serve as curtains.<br><br> As I lay in the back of my Prius, reading by headlamp, I looked over to see a family of four sleeping in an old Honda Accord. A man slept in a reclined driver&#39;s seat. A child stretched across the back seat. In the front passenger seat, a woman cradled a sleeping toddler. I hoped it was only for the night—some mix-up or scheduling mistake—but I suspected otherwise.<br><br> At stops like this, I often talked with fellow travelers, quickly finding a surprising degree of camaraderie among vehicle dwellers. Of course, many just want to be left alone, but others share food, jump one another&#39;s stalled-out vehicles, and—most important of all—swap notes on where it&#39;s safe to park.<br><br> The next day, I drove through San Francisco up to southern Oregon. Using <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://freecampsites.net/">Free Campsites</a> , a peer-to-peer platform for finding and reviewing camping locations, I picked a patch of Bureau of Land Management property just off I-5. For people living out of vehicles on the cheap, BLM land is the gold standard of campgrounds—parking is free for up to 14 days, and the sites are quiet, safe, and at least vaguely scenic.<br><br> After spending a few days with relatives in the Willamette Valley, I broke east toward Boise along Route 20, driving through a dust storm in the eastern Oregon Badlands. I stopped off in the foothills of the Boise National Forest, then beelined to a BLM campsite north of Yellowstone, where I spent a few days working off a mobile hotspot, free of distraction.<br><br> My experiment in vehicle dwelling was supposed to wrap up around this time. I had to get back to Los Angeles to help teach classes at UCLA. But the vacancy rate for apartments in the city was low, my Ph.D. stipend was paltry, and I was facing some unexpected debt. I realized I wouldn&#39;t be moving out of the Prius anytime soon.<br><br> S <span class="smallcaps">leeping in a car</span> in the city is much grimmer than in remote areas. Many cities <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01944363.2022.2050936">ban vehicle living entirely</a> , though often a de facto ban is enforced through parking policies, such as permit requirements or limited hours.<br><br> Los Angeles deploys a zone system, dividing the city into a patchwork of areas where vehicle living isn&#39;t and is tolerated. Places where it&#39;s not tolerated tend to be nice and well lit—residential neighborhoods and parking lots. Streets where it is tolerated tend to be dark and isolated, the kinds of places where you risk being the victim of a break-in. Sleep on the wrong street at the wrong time, and you could be ticketed, towed, or woken by police officers knocking on the window in the middle of the night.<br><br> When I didn&#39;t need to be close to campus, I often slept in the Angeles National Forest, just northeast of La Cañada Flintridge. Forest rangers there turn a mercifully blind eye to the dozens of families who sleep each night in dirt pullouts along Angeles Crest Highway. When I did need to be close to school, I slept among other UCLA students and construction workers a few blocks from campus—the exact scene that had so repulsed me when I first moved to Los Angeles.<br><br> There are three categories of vehicle living in Los Angeles. And thanks to citywide counts, we know exactly <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://rawcdn.githack.com/mnolangray/up206-nolan-group/d443cc9b7150f167a9af1bf07c232dd19dd13e36/group_assignments/la_total.html">where</a> each group clusters. Slightly more than half of the people living out of vehicles are in RVs. Large and conspicuous, RVs are typically <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.google.com/maps/@34.2141094,-118.3602808,3a,83.2y,90.64h,93.12t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sJ9YsJDeXcN6JU7l5HQwt9A!2e0!7i16384!8i8192">tolerated</a> only in industrial areas, where they line many streets. Roughly one in six live in vans. Thanks to the popularity of “van life” culture, they tend to concentrate in hip, beachside neighborhoods like Venice.<br><br> And then there are cars. By the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.lahsa.org/data?id=54-homeless-count-by-city-community">official count</a> , they house nearly a quarter of people who live out of vehicles, but this is almost certainly an undercount, because cars and their residents blend in. Relative to other people struggling with homelessness, they <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10511482.2022.2117990">are more likely</a> to be white, women, parents, and only temporarily homeless.<br><br> Of course, vehicle living can pose sanitation and public-health concerns. But criminalizing it, as so many cities effectively do, does nothing to address the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/01/homelessness-affordable-housing-crisis-democrats-causes/672224/">obvious</a> underlying cause of vehicular homelessness—a lack of housing. It just makes people&#39;s already hard lives harder.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he good news</span> is that some cities are reforming these policies. Starting with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://carbajal.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1026#:~:text=The%20very%20first%20safe%20parking,original%20champion%20of%20the%20program.">Santa Barbara in 2004</a> , many cities have implemented “safe parking” programs, setting aside parking lots where people who live out of cars can park overnight free of harassment. The facilities are often hosted by faith groups, and the best ones provide security, bathrooms and showers, and access to case workers who can connect residents with social services.<br><br> But by one <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://priceschool.usc.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Smart-Practices-for-Safe-Parking-USC-2021.pdf">estimate</a> , Los Angeles provides fewer than 500 such parking spots. Even if the city converted all <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ladotparking.org/parking-facilities/">11,400 public parking spaces</a> into safe parking, it still wouldn&#39;t be enough.<br><br> Here at UCLA, where <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.latimes.com/homeless-housing/story/2022-11-17/gimme-shelter-californias-housing-crisis-forces-college-students-into-homelessness">one in 20</a> students will at some point struggle with homelessness, administrators have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://dailybruin.com/2020/01/15/ucla-rejects-parking-space-proposal-for-students-experiencing-homelessness">rejected</a> student-led <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.facebook.com/safeparkingucla/">requests</a> for on-campus safe parking—a campaign organized in part by one of my former students who spent a few months living out of his car on the same Westwood street where I would occasionally sleep. Perhaps it would be embarrassing for the university to admit that many students live out of vehicles. But is the alternative any less embarrassing?<br><br> If the student-homelessness crisis has a silver lining, it&#39;s that it seems to have created a generation of activists committed to reform. You can throw a rock at pro-housing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://cayimby.org/">YIMBY</a> (“Yes in My Backyard”) gatherings and hit someone who has been forced to live out of a car. That includes Muhammad Alameldin, a researcher at the Terner Center for Housing Innovation. He was a student at Berkley when a snafu with roommates and a brutal Bay Area housing shortage pushed him into his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://peninsulapress.com/2022/07/19/advocate-for-affordable-housing-was-once-homeless-himself/">Prius for three months</a> .<br><br> Like Alameldin, I moved back into an apartment after three months of living in my Prius, a period made manageable by the occasional stay in a cheap hotel or with friends and family.<br><br> Ask anyone living out of a car how they fell into this life, and they will likely say: “I wanted to live free”; “I wanted to see the country”; “I wanted to go on an adventure.” But let the conversation carry on for more than a few minutes, and you will inevitably bump into a sadder origin story: a layoff, a divorce, a death, a foreclosure, an eviction.<br><br> The urge to roam is human. But roaming is a lot more romantic when it isn&#39;t done out of desperation.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:34:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/california-vehicular-homelessness-car-dwelling-los-angeles/674901/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/california-vehicular-homelessness-car-dwelling-los-angeles/674901/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How Bronze Age Pervert Charmed the Far Right]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> An internet personality who espouses fascism, racism, and bodybuilding has won influential converts. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/X35VKnlDAd_EfiRV75a7zZd-2fo=/0x5:2105x2636/648x810/media/img/2023/07/26/0923_WEL_BAP3/original.jpg" alt="插图中，肌肉发达的胡须男子雕塑站在爱奥尼亚柱上，周围环绕着绵羊、山羊、狮子和大象等动物，还有燃烧的秃鹰从天而降" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Nicolás Ortega.

The significance of this role could not have been obvious at the time, either to Novak (who was in high school) or to its victims, the bewildered patrons of Boston&#39;s Museum of Fine Arts. Novak had recruited a Romanian classmate with a deep voice, and together they&#39;d <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.boston.com/uncategorized/noprimarytagmatch/2011/11/23/b-j-novak-confesses-to-mfa-prank/">recorded an audio tour</a> for the exhibition “Tales From the Land of Dragons: 1,000 Years of Chinese Painting.” With the help of friends, they then slipped cassettes containing <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tenderbutton.com/bmfa/bmfa.mp3">their tour</a> into the museum&#39;s official audio guides.<br><br> Art lovers must have wondered about the thick Eastern European accent that greeted them, over the twang of a Chinese string instrument. The Romanian soon became opinionated (“Personally,” he said, “I think this painting is a piece of crap”), then deranged. He alluded to his “disgusting anatomical abnormalities.” He called his listeners “decadent imperialist maggots” and confessed a desire to smash a glass case with a sledgehammer and “rip [a] scroll to shreds with my teeth, which, by the way, are extremely long and sharp … more like fangs than human teeth.” At last he offered an interlude of “idiot music” while he fumbled with his script. “This should keep you occupied, you drooling imbecile!” he bellowed at the listeners, by now either amused or complaining to management. The last several minutes were a cha-cha by Tito Puente.<br><br> Exit Novak from the stage of American fascism. (His last known political donation was $1,000 to Hillary Clinton in 2016.) But the Romanian has kept in character, complete with the peevish attitude and hammed-up accent. About the time Novak went on <i>Letterman</i> , the Romanian began posting on social media as “Bronze Age Pervert,” a mad-in-both-senses weirdo who had escaped the Museum of Fine Arts and now aimed to take over the world. His message, delivered in tweets, podcasts, and a self-published book, mixes ultra-far-right politics, unabashed racism, and a deep knowledge of ancient Greece. He has never shown his face or admitted his real name. But I know Bronze Age Pervert, and have known him almost as long as BJ Novak has. He&#39;s an MIT graduate who grew up in Newton, Massachusetts. His name is Costin Alamariu.<br><br> It is hard to convey precisely what BAP believes, in part because his views are so outlandish that even when stated simply, they sound like incoherent ranting. America&#39;s civic religion holds that all humans have inherent and equal worth, that they should not be graded according to beauty or nobility, and that they should not aim to destroy one another. BAP says this orthodoxy is exactly wrong. He argues that the natural and desirable condition of life is the domination of the weak and ugly by the strong and noble. He considers American cities a “wasteland” run by Jews and Black people, though the words he uses to denote these groups are considerably less genteel than these.<br><br> The modern state, he says, has been designed to empower the feebleminded and the misshapen at the expense of their betters. The strong and noble must humiliate and conquer their tormentors and destroy their institutions. On Twitter, where he has more than 100,000 followers, BAP posts images of seminude Aryan beefcakes, usually in tropical settings, to celebrate the physical perfection of the warrior element of the race that he hopes will someday be restored to dominance.<br><br> The world, or at least parts of it, has been more receptive to BAP than one might think. By now he is a leading cultural figure on the fascist right—among both elites, who have cottoned to his political philosophy, and non-elites, who love his brio and aspire to his erudition.<br><br> I consider myself a connoisseur of brilliant lunatics, and I have a high tolerance for their lunacy if it has compensating virtues of, say, humor or ingenuity. But even I find BAP worrisome. What starts as comedy can become something more sinister—and BAP&#39;s shtick, while sometimes hilarious, shows every sign of transforming into a new mode of far-right radicalism, with fans in positions of responsibility and power.<br><br> Typically philosophy books go unread even by the philosophers&#39; closest friends and family. But BAP&#39;s book, <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> (2018), tumbled screeching into the world, unignorable, at one point ranking among the top 150 books in the entire Amazon catalog. “It&#39;s still a cult book,” a former Trump White House official <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2019/08/23/alt-right-book-trump-1472413">told <i>Politico</i> in 2019</a> . “If you&#39;re a young person, intelligent, adjacent in some way to the right, it&#39;s very likely you would have heard of it.” His podcast, <i>Caribbean Rhythms</i> , has likewise won an avid following.<br><br> Only the most incautious admit their devotion. BAP tells his young disciples to burrow into government, to deny him publicly, to wait. Matthew Kriner, with the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism, monitors the social-media activity of groups that are trying to ignite race wars and revive fascist movements. Their accounts have unsubtle Teutonic names such as Atomwaffen. “Bronze Age Pervert is across the vast majority of them,” Kriner told me. Moreover, he has an odd crossover appeal—among both extremely online misfits and figures with real-world influence. BAP, Kriner said, “represents that bridge to get you from really not-acceptable content to maybe ending up in someone&#39;s legislative activities, within a very reasonable amount of time.”<br><br> BAP&#39;s relationship to Donald Trump has been curious. He refers to the former president repeatedly, almost in the manner of a Homeric epithet, as a Borscht Belt comedian, a master of yuks. To BAP, Trump&#39;s chief virtue is destruction. He views the former president fondly, as a kindred insult comic, brazenly impious and generally right about race and immigration. The affection has been repaid in print by Michael Anton, a former Trump-administration national-security official who wrote <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://claremontreviewofbooks.com/are-the-kids-altright/">a 2019 essay</a> in the <i>Claremont Review of Books</i> sympathetic to BAP, while noting his tendency to be “racist,” “anti-Semitic,” “anti-democratic,” “misogynistic,” and “homophobic.” Anton suggested (correctly, I think) that BAP&#39;s vile utterances, whether sincere or not, serve a purpose: to keep whiny leftists so busy cataloging his petty thoughtcrimes that they overlook his more serious heresies. Meanwhile, those capable of reading him without being rage-blinded quietly learn from him and heed his advice to bond, network, and plot.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/04/us-extremism-portland-george-floyd-protests-january-6/673088/">From the April 2023 issue: America&#39;s terrifying cycle of extremist violence</a><br><br> Anton wrote that BAP “speaks directly to a youthful dissatisfaction (especially among white males) with equality as propagandized and imposed in our day: a hectoring, vindictive, resentful, leveling, hypocritical equality that punishes excellence and publicly denies all difference while at the same time elevating and enriching a decadent, incompetent, and corrupt elite.” Anton, who was once a graduate student in political philosophy, ended his essay by prognosticating a BAPist future: “In the spiritual war for the hearts and minds of the disaffected youth on the right, conservatism is losing. BAPism is winning.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">BAPism, for all</span> its emphasis on bodily perfection, began as an intellectual phenomenon, and its first victories came in intellectual circles. They were so subtle that even the guardians of those circles recognized their enemy only after he was already within the gates.<br><br> Last year, at a conference of political philosophers at Michigan State University, a Yale professor named Bryan Garsten told his colleagues that they were in trouble. The topic of the conference was liberalism—not Ted Kennedy liberalism, but the classical version that predates the modern Democratic Party and indeed America itself. Liberalism is the view that individuals have rights and beliefs, and that politics involves safeguarding rights and making compromises when beliefs conflict. It has existed for only a few centuries and is by some measures the most successful idea in history. Just look where people want to live: the United States, the European Union, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, all liberal places that people will risk their life to reach.<br><br> But <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4L6kyGVHIJ0">Garsten said</a> liberalism had some of his best students hopping into rafts and paddling in other intellectual directions. He said they had been “captured” by the belief “that to be morally serious, one faces a choice.” The choice, he said, is not between liberalism and illiberalism. Liberalism had already lost. Its greatest champion, the United States, had run aground after pointless wars, terminal decadence, and bureaucratic takeover by activists and special interests. Garsten said his best students were choosing between the protofascism of Nietzsche and a neomedieval, quasi-theocratic version of Catholicism opposed to Enlightenment liberalism. These students considered liberal democracy an exhausted joke, and they hinted—and sometimes did more than hint—that the past few centuries had been a mistake, and that the mistake should now be corrected.<br><br> Some at the conference countered that these illiberals might have just not done their homework. “Your students need to become better readers,” said Diana J. Schaub, a political-science professor at Loyola University Maryland. But Garsten&#39;s illiberal students were good readers. Their deficiencies lay elsewhere, possibly everywhere but there.<br><br> Many of the participants knew that Garsten was talking about the threat posed by Bronze Age Pervert, though his name was uttered with great reluctance. Partly this reluctance came from political philosophers&#39; unwillingness to admit that they browse the Twitter feed of a genocidal nudist. Partly it was their worry that they had unwittingly been complicit in BAPism&#39;s spread by sending their students to intern in Washington, and to staff offices on Capitol Hill and in conservative institutions such as the Heritage Foundation.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/harlan-crow-clarence-thomas-relationship/674092/">Graeme Wood: Harlan Crow wants to stop talking about Clarence Thomas</a><br><br> From there, BAPism reached members of the right who lack philosophical training—young men whose main interest is not in the rise or fall of the American civic religion but in something more primal, an urge they themselves hardly understand, let alone control. “There is a level of self-loathing, chronic-masturbating anger out there among adolescent and early-20s fucked-up males,” one Republican operative told me. To them the world is dry, purposeless, and designed for the flourishing of anyone but them. Conservatism in the old way—not Bronze Age old, but Reagan old—does not satisfy them. “BAPism essentially involves re-enchanting the world and giving purpose to these young guys,” the operative told me. “And for some reason we can&#39;t.”<br><br> “Do you watch <i>X-Men</i> ?” Vish Burra, a 32-year-old legislative aide to Representative George Santos of New York, asked me recently. He said BAP&#39;s followers hid out in government like mutants in the Marvel Comics universe. (The leader of the mutants, Professor Charles Xavier, can put on a special helmet and scan the world for fellow mutants.) “The movement&#39;s coagulating, connecting,” Burra said, and only at private gatherings and parties will the BAPists on Capitol Hill confess their devotion. Someday, he said, they&#39;ll go public, with a “big reveal.” But that moment will not come until the BAPists “get in position first,” Burra said. “Why would I [reveal myself] before I&#39;m in front of the control panel?”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">After the museum prank,</span> almost 20 years passed before BAP&#39;s politics emerged into the light. And just as it did, the Romanian himself shrank vampirically into the shadows. No one seems sure where he is, or how he spends his days. But a sufficiently colorful and idiosyncratic personality is its own guarantee of detection. When I heard his podcast, it took me about 10 seconds to identify him.<br><br> Costin Alamariu is in his mid-40s, and he has never publicly admitted that he is BAP. (He did not reply to requests for comment for this article.) I met him only once, two decades ago, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, after a mutual friend intuited that we might enjoy each other&#39;s company. Costin appeared one night wearing a dramatic overcoat—the kind whose wearer is begging for those around him to make a comment. I resisted. He had emigrated from Romania, he said, when he was about 10. That explained the Dracula note in his voice.<br><br> We spent that evening striding around Cambridge, having what I vaguely recall as a conversation that started with philosophy and then roamed widely over history, ethnography, and literature. Notably absent from our discussion was mathematics, then Costin&#39;s undergraduate major at MIT. He had a gift for finely titrated offense—just enough to appall me but keep the conversation going. He learned that I was studying Persian, and I said the grammar was startlingly simple, because its use as a lingua franca over several centuries had shorn it of many of its complexities. “Is it like Spanish,” he asked, in a mischievous deadpan, “where every time you say a word, you feel your brain shrinking?”<br><br> For many years, we corresponded. Costin&#39;s messages arrived irregularly, and the tone ranged from friendly and inquisitive to boorish and insulting. I went to South America on assignment. He sent long messages extolling the virtues of Joseph Conrad&#39;s novel <i>Nostromo</i> , which is set there. A friend who reads books like <i>Nostromo</i> , and can talk about them, is a friend worth putting up with. When I traveled to northwestern Pakistan, he suggested that we go in on a cabin in the mountains around Chitral and “plan the freedom of the Kalash,” an Indigenous Indo-Aryan people in the surrounding valleys.<br><br> About 10 years ago, he took to calling my friends “fags” and exhorting me not to “be a faggot.” At some point he had begun bodybuilding, and he sent me a picture of himself shirtless, with the message “Do you like this pic of me.” (He had asked me to keep our messages between us, and I continue to honor that request, with the exception of offhand remarks, comments he has repeated elsewhere, and publicly available facts. He must have sent the seminude thirst pic to others, because I have not shared it, but it has surfaced on social media.)<br><br> Eventually I decided that the book recommendations and ethnographic whimsies no longer made the slurs worth enduring. I let our correspondence trail off. I wrote to him when I discovered his BAP persona, and then it was he who stopped replying to me.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">BAP&#39;s origin story</span> begins at Newton South High School, outside Boston. Newton has an outstanding public-school system, and both he and the friend who introduced us were in a clique of edgy nerds and teenage intellectuals. In philosophy, the group favored Nietzsche; in music, Rachmaninoff; in politics, none of the above. They indulged in adolescent intoxication with ideas, especially the forbidden and obscure. This kind of extremism is a privilege of youth, because if you&#39;re still just a kid, you can idolize Che Guevara or Nietzsche all you like, and (usually) no one gets hurt.<br><br> Newton also has a large Jewish population. BAP has said on Twitter that he is Jewish, and this appears to be true. Costin has relatives who were interned in Nazi concentration camps. His older brother works as a geopolitical strategist at an investment research firm and has no detectable accent. Costin has kept his Romanian accent in private life. While in character, he speaks in what I believe is an intentionally bad Russian accent.<br><br> After high school, Costin went to MIT, where his father worked in the technology-licensing office. <i>The New York Times</i> once ran a photo of Costin, wearing his overcoat with Teva sandals, to illustrate the impaired fashion sense of MIT undergraduates. Upon graduation, he briefly worked in investment banking in New York, then began a doctoral program in political science at Yale—where he was a student of Bryan Garsten&#39;s. (I teach part-time in Costin&#39;s old department, where Garsten is a friend and colleague. Costin had left New Haven by the time I arrived.)<br><br> Faculty and graduate students from that era describe him as clever and manipulative. He wrote caustic letters to the student newspaper and contributed to <i>The New Criterion</i> , a venerable right-leaning cultural journal. He disappeared for long periods. He claimed he had been living out of a van in Argentina. No one was sure what to believe. His aversion to normal human company echoed Nietzsche&#39;s: “When I am among the many I live as the many do, and I do not think as I really think; after a time it always seems as though they want to banish me from myself and rob me of my soul.” When among fellow grad students, he mocked them and played tricks. One grad student took Costin seriously, only to realize, she told me, “Oh no—I&#39;m an idiot—this guy is just fucking with me.”<br><br> One of the best ways to conceal your genocidal fascism is to write about it openly in that most unread of documents, the unpublished doctoral dissertation.<br><br> Costin was always ready to talk about political philosophy, but he objected to attempts to enlist him in mundane campus politics. Others gathered signatures to denounce dictators during the Arab Spring. He humbly suggested that if petitions did not topple Hosni Mubarak, a well-attended candlelight vigil might. Yale&#39;s grad students attempted to unionize and to pressure the university to increase stipends and benefits. One wrote to a grad-student listserv with questions about the school&#39;s dental-insurance coverage. “My cousin Benko run Benko-Magnitogorsk Dental Emporium, he make good dental work in white van at Grand Av. and East St. in parking lot outside plumbing supplies store,” Costin replied. “You forward me small price of $100 he do work … steel teeth, gold teeth anything you want.” The email was an early exercise in refitting his character to needle and ridicule liberals.<br><br> His dissertation is a peculiar document. His adviser, Steven B. Smith, is often identified with the German-born Jewish philosopher Leo Strauss, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/review/25alter.html">about whom Smith wrote an elegant book</a> . Strauss argued that great thinkers have embedded hidden messages in their writing, and the apparent meaning of their books and essays often contradicts the recondite meaning that only discerning readers can decode. The upshot: Read carefully, because things are not what they seem.<br><br> Costin&#39;s dissertation follows Smith&#39;s and Strauss&#39;s lead. It is eccentric even within this eccentric tradition, as Costin himself allows. He reads Plato in a Straussian style: Plato&#39;s teacher, Socrates, was executed for doing philosophy in a manner vexing to the Athenian state, so naturally Plato would have learned from that experience and written so that only the most perceptive reader could discern his true, subversive beliefs. At least one of those beliefs, in Costin&#39;s reading, is a doozy. Plato, taken by most readers to scorn tyrants, is read by Costin as their covert defender. “Philosophy and tyranny are fundamentally connected,” Costin writes, and their shared aim is eugenic. They seek “the breeding,” the “biological” production of genius, nobility, and virtue: a master race.<br><br> “There is much in this view that is frightening and even abhorrent to us,” Costin writes. Yet he states that Plato&#39;s claims are validated by the history of human cultures. For evidence, he offers a bizarre mix of folklore, history, and ethnography. The development of an aristocratic class, he says, demands conquest, the vanquishing of lesser races by the organized violence of the greater. As an example, he quotes Pierre van den Berghe, an anthropologist who described Rwandan Tutsis, an archetypal aristocratic elite, as “intelligent, astute in political intrigue, born to command, refined, courageous, and cruel.” His dissertation is dripping with admiration for these martial, masculine virtues, and for their feminine counterpart of beauty. He despises, in turn, farming and manual labor, the characteristics of a slave class.<br><br> One of the best ways to conceal your genocidal fascism is to write about it openly in that most unread of documents, the unpublished doctoral dissertation. The few who noticed considered it an intellectual exercise rather than an act of incipient fascism.<br><br> Costin&#39;s advisers were not alone in failing to take his Nietzscheanism as seriously as they might have. Dustin Sebell, a former acquaintance of Costin&#39;s from that period and now a professor at Michigan State, told me that political philosophy as a whole has been one big victory parade for liberalism for several decades now. “You have a tradition of reflection that has gone on for decades largely oblivious to these radical Nietzschean critiques,” Sebell said. “When those critiques resurfaced, many professional philosophers had little to say for themselves.”<br><br> When Costin began submitting his doctoral work, Smith, his adviser, became enraged. “I was shocked that his family would escape Ceaușescu&#39;s Romania only for Costin to undermine the principles of [American] democracy,” Smith told me. “I view that as a shameful act of betrayal.” He said he made his disgust known but ultimately signed off, and Costin received his degree. “I was his dissertation adviser, not his censor.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In 2015, Emory University</span> hired Costin for a postdoctoral fellowship, on the basis of less incendiary writing samples. His time there was a disaster. He acted erratically. At one point, he refused to give Emory&#39;s human-resources department his home address. During the spring semester, the university discovered that Costin had secretly stopped teaching his classes in person and was instead attempting to teach them over email. Further investigation revealed that Costin was medically unable to teach in person, with a vague but apparently real physical infirmity. His fellowship was not renewed. Later he lived for some time in Brazil, although he has been sighted recently in Japan, Spain, Hong Kong, and Iceland.<br><br> Within two years of his departure from Emory, <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> was published—a noxious, digressive summa that incorporated the conclusions in his dissertation, and added many others too outré for any but a self-published document. It is a narcissistic, 198-page love letter to himself, or to the philosopher-as-muscleman that his BAP persona purports to be. The tone approaches at times the onanistic genius of a young Norman Mailer, but much more resentful toward the modern world. “Perversions—lame ones—are born by the thousands and haunt, like myriad cripplette midgets in halls of mirrors, they haunt the world, books, the internet. Minds are lost. If you wait any longer everything will be pounded to garbage, there will be nothing left—it will all turn, the whole world will turn to a Bulgarian rest stop lavatory,” he writes. “I declare to you, with great boldness, that I am here to save you from a great ugliness.”<br><br> The “Bronze Age” element of his perversion refers to the earliest days of ancient Greece—an era of virile pagan militarism.<br><br> The “great ugliness” is the liberal bureaucratic state. Democracy, he writes, destroys “personal freedom and initiative” by elevating an unworthy caste of subhuman creatures he calls “bugmen,” who flourish only under these debased conditions, like roaches in a pit latrine. On his podcast, BAP praises the philosopher James Burnham, who wrote that the heroic age of capitalism had passed, and that a “managerial revolution” had elevated to power bean counters and bureaucrats (think of his supposed persecutors from Emory&#39;s HR department) over noble intellects and creators. Any person of talent or intelligence is ground down by this system, by “life under the thumb of the empowered old matriarchs and the conceptual dildoes they use to clobber the heads of young men.”<br><br> The ugliness extends to art and culture. Low dominates high. Screeching popular music drowns out Rachmaninoff. “From the point of view of real culture and refinement we&#39;re as barbaric as the most obscure herd of the Khwarezm [an ancient Central Asian people] where the women scratch their pubes in public.”<br><br> The “Bronze Age” element of his perversion refers to the earliest days of ancient Greece—an era of virile pagan militarism, before the moderns, and even some of the ancients, were beguiled into weakness. Men performed feats of intellect and strength unknown today: memorization of names and poetry, running flat-out for miles under heavy armor to impale enemies. These men prospered under “life at its peak,” which happens “not in the grass hut village ruled by nutso mammies, but in the military state.”<br><br> Then things get weird. BAP fantasizes about a near-apocalyptic cleansing:<br><br> Here is my vision of the true justice, the justice of nature: the zoos opened, predators unleashed by the dozens, hundreds … four thousand hungry wolves rampaging on streets of these hive cities, elephants and bison stampeding, the buildings smashed to pieces, the cries of the human bug shearing through the streets as the lord of beasts returns. Manhattan, Moscow, Peking reduced to ruins overgrown by vines and forest, the haunt of the lynx and coyote again. The great cesspool slums, Calcutta, Nairobi, all the fetid latrines of the world covered over by mudslides, overgrown with thick jungle, this is justice. The beings fit to rule this rewilded landscape are the neo-warriors, men of greatness and violence. “The only right government is military government, and every other form is both hypocritical and destructive of true freedom,” BAP writes. He considers Japan during the late imperial period, when the emperor was a martial god, an ideal political arrangement, and has written elsewhere that it is “the perfect model of national political life and national identity.”<br><br> BAP styles his book an “exhortation,” and ultimately he exhorts white people to form military units with deep masculine bonds, and together annihilate lesser races or throw them under the yoke. One could more easily dismiss BAP as a political shock jock, and his racism as cheap and tasteless subversion, if this section were not so obviously heartfelt. He mentions by name the white mercenaries who toppled governments for profit and pleasure in the 20th century. “The coming age of barbarism will not be owned, as so many of you urban cucks fear, by the gangbangers and the unwashed hordes of the teeming cesspools of the world, but by clean-cut middle-class and working-class vets, men of military experience, who know something about how to shoot and how to organize. The fools who think oligarchs will be able to control these men for very long should look to the fortunes of the Sforzas”—the Renaissance clan that controlled, then lost, the duchy of Milan—“and many others, and remember that money is no match for force of arms combined with charm.”<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">I asked Vish Burra,</span> the young Hill staffer, how BAP had charmed him. “The power, the vitality, the energy,” he said. “The left has stuck itself in a position of promoting a politics of sterility.” He said he didn&#39;t agree with everything BAP said, but he loved the vision, the verve, the relentless mockery of the bugmen.<br><br> The bugmen, as Burra suggests, are terrible at countering BAP&#39;s message. Liberals and leftists are used to sitting in a blind, watching for telltale signs of their enemies&#39; racism. There is no point in yelling “racist” at someone who is already yelling racial epithets at full volume. And there is, among BAP&#39;s fans, perverse pleasure in watching their critics passionately denounce their hero, to no discernible effect.<br><br> BAPists are not supposed to talk about being BAPists, and they even have a term of abuse for those who do: <i>facefag</i> . “He wouldn&#39;t appreciate a face—” Rather than utter the word, Burra sort of gestured at it, pawing the air. “He wouldn&#39;t appreciate a guy like me, but I&#39;m a big fan.”<br><br> BAP enjoys suggesting how close his followers are to the control panels. He posts pictures of their copies of <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> next to tokens of their power, such as US-government-official passports and patches, IDs, and other items from the livery of the Secret Service, Army Rangers, Department of Homeland Security, and Air Force. He allows one to wonder whether for every Vish Burra, who proudly keeps his copy of the book on the office shelf, there are others who adopt bugman camouflage. To be part of a clandestine movement, so extreme that it feels almost invisible to one&#39;s elders, is part of the thrill. “I mentioned him in class the other day; my students were shocked that I knew who Bronze Age Pervert was,” the Notre Dame political theorist Patrick Deneen said at a conference in April.<br><br> A BAPist can take pleasure in having entered an exclusive cognitive club. One of his supporters wrote to me that BAP&#39;s character was layered with irony, and that the ability to see the truth in BAP, and separate it from the hilarious megalomania, is a kind of Straussian test, to determine who can read and think, and who is so offended by the racism, misogyny, and anti-Semitism that he is incapacitated and unable to focus on anything else, even to criticize it. “Nobody who has the IQ to listen to one hour of BAP without tuning out actually believes he recommends becoming an autistic nudist bodybuilder.”<br><br> I am not sure I pass that test. Listening to BAP, one gets the impression of florid insanity. He digresses as if not in control of his own thoughts. He barks insults and orders at subordinates in his recording studio, and one can reasonably wonder whether these figures are comic creations or psychotic delusions. He cannot possibly believe everything he says he believes.<br><br> BAP glorifies bodybuilding and devotes much of his Twitter feed to images of half-naked white hunks in the flower of youth. Allegedly this is to worship their vitality, their fitness for the aristocratic warrior class that the modern world has dishonored. He stresses that in ancient Athens, the cultivation of physical perfection was a privilege of the elite. Only citizens could train in the gymnasium. The process of creating an ideal male form was deemed beyond the station of lesser entities, such as women and slaves.<br><br> The parade of Adonises has led many to question BAP&#39;s sexuality. Bizarrely, Costin is not the only fascist I know who has been dogged by such rumors. Richard Spencer, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/his-kampf/524505/">my chemistry-lab partner in middle school</a> , faced persistent questions about his sexuality when he was a leader of the alt‑right. (If anyone out there can explain why homoerotic fascists keep seeking my company, please let me know.) Spencer told me, more than a little exasperated, that he thought the case for BAP&#39;s homosexuality had been proved. “If I had posted even one photo of some guy&#39;s ass on Twitter, do you think there would be any question in anyone&#39;s mind?” In <i>Bronze Age Mindset</i> , BAP writes that the confusion of masculine bonding for homosexuality “is misunderstanding and exaggeration promoted by the homonerds of our time,” a poverty of our imagination and lack of friendship, “because we can&#39;t conceive of such intense love between friends without some carnal or material benefit in play.”<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2017/06/his-kampf/524505/">From the June 2017 issue: How Richard Spencer became an icon for white supremacists</a><br><br> The sheer length of time BAP has held his pose makes one wonder whether more of it is sincere than his followers think. As a character sings in a Sam Shepard play, “I believe in my mask: The man I made up is me.” The breeding of a caste of supermen is not just a pseudo-comic reverie. It is the subject of his dissertation. The fantasies of killing “lower forms of life” are not funny at all, not even as a lampoon of liberal excess. And while some people know BAP personally, and vouch for his intelligence and wit, few have emerged to state with confidence that he&#39;s not a fascist and racist. That is because he probably is one.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">What might it</span> feel like to experience the modern world as a “great ugliness”—an inverted kingdom of sniveling ass-kissers? “Society became something approaching mass concentration camp,” BAP has said on his podcast. “I&#39;m exaggerating only a little.” His rejection of this world is matched by his rejection by it. His classmates are successful; they hold good jobs. One by one, the adolescent Nietzscheans grew up into productive citizens, and put aside childish fascinations. The person who introduced us, now decades ago, was once so close to Costin that their friends described them as sharing something almost as deep as marriage. (They did not suggest the bond was erotic.) That friend has excelled in a normal life: a job at a tech company, a family, leadership in his synagogue. At some point he chose to be normal, which means rejecting BAP.<br><br> Liberalism&#39;s victory had been so overwhelming that for generations it grew soft, unaccustomed to the hard work of defending itself. Now a ranting nudist poses a real danger.<br><br> To take a job, to toil in the modern fields among the bugs and bugmen, is the greatest betrayal. No one respectable wants anything to do with someone who tweets out messages calling for “high violence” against the “kike and nigger” scourge.<br><br> BAP has responded to this rejection with bitterness, with what Milton called “a sense of injured merit.” I find his message melancholic. Recently he posted a video of himself in Rio de Janeiro&#39;s Botanical Garden, following around a wild bird. “Yes, hello,” he says. “Do not run from me. Come back. I love you.” I do not see much space for true love in the world he has built for himself, whose components are war, purification, and mutual masculine admiration ever fearful of its eros.<br><br> Fixation on BAP&#39;s monstrous qualities has, I think, led even his fervent admirers to overlook the most unexpected aspect of his philosophy, which is a literal belief in the transmigration of souls, as described in Eastern religions and the work of Arthur Schopenhauer. If this life fails, another will come. When the ironic pose drops, when the outrageous Boratism subsides, this conviction is what remains. “I believe reincarnation is fundamentally true,” he writes, in a section of his book that does not appear to be for laughs.<br><br> “I think that is the deepest layer of his outlook,” Dustin Sebell, at Michigan State, told me. “He believes in an esoteric version of metempsychosis, that our truest selves live on after death and take on different forms. He is profoundly unwilling to accept his own mortality.”<br><br> No humans receive praise higher than what BAP lavishes on noble animals like jaguars and birds of prey. He is taken, however, with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20201124-yukio-mishima-the-strange-tale-of-japans-infamous-novelist">the diminutive Japanese writer Yukio Mishima</a> . In midlife, Mishima took up bodybuilding and raised a squad of erotically intertwined neo-samurai warriors. When it became clear that Japan&#39;s managerial revolution had extinguished its imperial spirit, he attempted to overthrow the Japanese government and restore the power of the emperor. After that failed, he ritually disemboweled himself.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">In Michigan,</span> when<span class="smallcaps"> </span>Bryan Garsten made his comment about the seductions of illiberalism, BAP was like the ghost at the banquet, cackling from the rafters at his professor&#39;s consternation. But the remarks went on longer, and they were also searching, and self-critical. Garsten told his listeners that they—he—may have failed to cultivate students&#39; imagination. His illiberal students, Garsten said, had learned why the Greeks admired Achilles, the fiery warrior. But they neglected the Greeks&#39; admiration for Ulysses, a subtler and greater model of manhood. Ulysses&#39;s greatness emerged not from his rejection of this world, but from his mastery of its constraints. He owed myriad debts to those around him: to his men, to his son, to his wife.<br><br> The students romanticized the tyrant, while assuming that liberalism bred sloth and laziness. “Life in a liberal democracy is full of demanding moments,” Garsten said at the conference. I had the impression that he was addressing BAP apostrophically, delivering a warning he wished he had delivered in person. “As far as I have read, life under tyrants is full of lassitude, selfishness, duplicity, betrayal.”<br><br> One could feel, over the course of these discussions, the stirrings of dormant liberal passions—as if the mere invocation of BAPism, after many years ignored, had inspired a counteroffensive. Another political theorist, a former Marine and a Brookings Institution scholar named William A. Galston, piped up to remind everyone that when liberalism had come under mortal threat in the Pacific theater, “Americans as a whole found it in themselves to do something.” Specifically, his fellow Marines charged, shot, and bayoneted their way from island to island until illiberalism, in the form of Japanese fascism, begged them for mercy. “Is there really an opposition between the open society and the virtue of courage?” Galston asked.<br><br> The defeat of imperial Japan illustrated the point nicely, I thought. But it also raised a much stranger question, about how liberals acquired such a reputation for sissydom in the first place. The Battle of Iwo Jima wasn&#39;t that long ago. But in certain spaces—academia, elite journalism—liberalism&#39;s victory had been so overwhelming that for generations it grew soft, flabby, and unaccustomed to the hard work of defending itself from a vigorous challenger. As such challengers left universities and newspapers, those institutions became self-congratulatory monocultures, inhospitable even to conservatives far less nutty than BAP. By now, a ranting nudist poses a real danger—of poisoning politics, splitting apart societies, and persuading otherwise talented people to spurn the modern world&#39;s greatest achievements, which are peace, tolerance, and prosperity.<br><br> The great Straussian Allan Bloom predicted doom for liberalism when these challenges disappeared. “The most essential of our freedoms, as men and as liberal democrats, the freedom of our minds, consists in the consciousness of the fundamental alternatives,” he wrote. An unchallenged liberal democrat, he argued, ceases to want to improve, unless he confronts his enemies in their most potent forms. Those forms will shock and humble us, he wrote, and have “the added salutary effect of destroying our sense of our own worth and giving us higher aspirations.”<br><br> To Costin personally, I have never been more grateful. His last message came during the pandemic. I asked how things were looking in Brazil. “Not bad,” he reported, with laconic caginess. He had not yet veered, as he later did in his public statements about COVID-19, into outright conspiracy theory and extended roasts of Anthony Fauci. Since then, I have come to think of BAP&#39;s performances in immunological terms: a gnarly virus that had lain dormant for decades in circles of philosophers and their unread books. Now that it&#39;s loose in the human population, it is a vicious kick to the liberal immune system. And that is not entirely bad. Unchallenged, liberalism&#39;s defenses waned, and liberals forgot, temporarily, why their cause was worth defending. The antibodies are stirring.<br><br> <small><em>This article appears in the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09/">September 2023</a> print edition with the headline “The Rise of Bronze Age Pervert.”</em></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/bronze-age-pervert-costin-alamariu/674762/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/bronze-age-pervert-costin-alamariu/674762/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[Bird Flu Has Never Done This Before]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Experts worry that H5N1 avian influenza is now endemic in North America. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/6jYHqnitUuBFLbZvsO6hB2GZBtk=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/avian_flu_/original.jpg" alt="三名身穿危险服的护林员清理死去的鸟类，而其他护林员则在天空中飞翔" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Owen Humphreys / PA Images / Getty</figcaption></figure> At bird breeding grounds this spring and summer, the skies have been clearer and quieter, the flocks drastically <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/about-the-rspb/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/concern-grows-for-angleseys-seabird-colonies/">thinned</a> .

In the past couple of years, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.who.int/news/item/12-07-2023-ongoing-avian-influenza-outbreaks-in-animals-pose-risk-to-humans">more than 100 million domestic poultry have died</a> , many of them deliberately culled; out in the wild, the deaths <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.02.539182v1">may be in the millions</a> too—the corpses have just been too inaccessible and too numerous for scientists to count. “It&#39;s been carnage,” Michelle Wille, a virologist at the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, told me. “For many species, we are losing decades of conservation work.”<br><br> For months, experts worried most about the outbreak&#39;s magnitude—it struck so swiftly and lethally that it&#39;s become the most deadly H5N1 epidemic recorded in North America. Now the looming concern is length: when, and if, the virus will withdraw.<br><br> History would seem to be on our side, at least in North America: Earlier versions of avian flu that made it to this side of the world flamed out within a year or two, quashed by the ebb and flow of migrating hosts and by concerted poultry culls. But this new strain is stubborn, pounding the continent more or less continuously. “That has never happened before,” Vijaykrishna Dhanasekaran, a virologist at Hong Kong University, told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/02/avian-bird-flu-virus-outbreak-epidemic/673058/">Read: Eagles are falling, bears are going blind</a><br><br> The situation has grown dire enough that last month, the United States began, for the first time in history, to offer avian-flu vaccines to birds—starting with critically endangered California condors, which have lost more than 20 members of their very small population to the virus and cannot afford more, Ashleigh Blackford, US Fish and Wildlife Service&#39;s California-condor coordinator, told me. This choice is one of many grim and tacit acknowledgments that this virus is now so entrenched that it&#39;s almost certain to circulate here indefinitely.<br><br> The longer the virus lingers, the greater the chance that it will pose a different danger: permanent tenancy among mammals, a group that, historically, the virus has not easily infected and spread among. Some experts worry that the virus has now managed to establish new methods of transmission in select communities of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/08/health/avian-flu-mink-h5n1.html">mink</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://outbreaknewstoday.com/h5n1-avian-influenza-reported-foxes-on-finland-fur-farm-96292/">foxes</a> on fur farms, and maybe in wild seals. The chances of an outbreak among people—certainly, of another pandemic—are still, in absolute terms, low, Nídia Trovão, a virologist at the Fogarty International Center, told me. But the more new places H5N1 establishes itself for good, the more its threat to us will grow.<br><br> Scientists can&#39;t yet say <i>why</i> this particular flu virus has found such unprecedented success in North America, only that it has. In the two years since its arrival, it has infiltrated more birds and mammals—including species not previously known to be vulnerable to avian flus—than has any other pathogen of its ilk. Among the most affected creatures have been <i>wild</i> birds, a major departure from previous strains that primarily attacked poultry. And although past viruses in this family have been relatively slow to evolve, this one keeps amping up its genetic diversity by <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2022-2023/h5n1-technical-report_june.htm">mixing its genome</a> with bits of other bird-borne flus—tweaks that may be helping H5N1 find even more new hosts and execute further genomic changes still.<br><br> Not all infected with H5N1 develop terrible disease—and in recent months, researchers have even spotted signs that the outbreak is on the wane. In certain parts of the US and Europe, case counts in the wild seem to be slumping. And scientists are stumbling upon gannets in Scotland carrying antibodies to the virus—and whose eyes have, in the aftermath of presumed infection, bizarrely changed color <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.rspb.org.uk/about-the-rspb/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/black-eyes-in-seabirds-indicates-bird-flu-survival/">from blue to black</a> . Wendy Puryear, a virologist at Tufts University School of Veterinary Medicine, is now searching for similar hints of immunity in gray seals.<b> </b>Should this pattern continue, there&#39;s hope that the virus, at least in this part of the world, could “just fizzle out,” Dhanasekaran said.<br><br> Wille and other researchers, though, are looking toward autumn with a degree of dread. Another surge of disease could appear then, especially as seasonal migrations return birds to their overwintering homes. Even without a fall comeback, the math is against elimination in North America, where the virus has infiltrated well over 100 species. At this point, H5N1 lingering in at least <i>some</i> creatures seems far likelier than a full and permanent retreat <i>.</i><br><br> For people, the news is still, tentatively, <i>okay</i> .<i> </i>“In its current form, the virus has very, very low transmissibility to humans,” with just a handful of cases detected, says Ian Barr, the deputy director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. But the list of mammals catching the virus is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://efsa.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.2903/j.efsa.2023.8191">still growing</a> . In some of these outbreaks, the root cause is likely avian, experts told me: cats <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/avianflu/spotlights/2022-2023/bird-flu-polish-domestic-cats.htm">eating raw poultry</a> ; raccoons, skunks, and other scavengers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nbcnews.com/science/science-news/bird-flu-mammals-scientists-on-alert-mutations-rcna69541">presumably</a> snarfing the carcasses of infected birds. Other cases, though—seals at sea, foxes and mink crowded into fur farms—seem better explained by mammals catching H5N1 directly from another of their own kind. Given the sheer number of animals involved, “it&#39;s hard to fathom that each was individually exposed to an infected bird,” Louise Moncla, an avian-influenza expert at the University of Pennsylvania, told me.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2023/06/vaccinating-wildlife-population-disease-bird-flu/674399/">Read: We vaccinate animals more than ourselves</a><br><br> Since the virus arrived in North America, it also appears to have become deadlier, with particularly devastating effects when it infiltrates certain creatures&#39; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/spectrum.02867-22">brains</a> , Richard Webby, a virologist and the director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Studies on the Ecology of Influenza in Animals and Birds, told me. Fox kits have been found racked with tremors; bears have gone partially blind.<br><br> To truly transform into an even worse scourge, the virus would need to shape-shift from a pathogen that primarily plagues bird guts into one that could easily infiltrate mammalian lungs. The virus has already taken at least one step toward that: Researchers sampling H5N1-infected mammals, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36688676/">including</a> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.mdpi.com/2076-0817/12/2/168">foxes</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9853945/">mink</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/29/8/23-0188_article">cats</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.29.501155v1.full.pdf">seals</a> , and even a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/14/science/bird-flu-humans.html">person</a> , have detected genetic tweaks that are helping the microbe replicate inside mammalian cells. But a boost in infective capability alone isn&#39;t enough for a large-scale outbreak, Webby said. The virus would probably need to circumvent some mammal-specific immune defenses. And it would certainly need to acquire the ability to more efficiently transmit<i> </i>between mammalian hosts via, say, an airborne route. There&#39;s not yet evidence, Webby told me, that the virus has pulled off such changes, though just a few might suffice: better binding to receptors on mammalian lung cells, a more stable structure so it could travel via aerosol.<br><br> That said, the criteria for properly mammalizing a flu virus “are not really well understood,” Moncla said. All that&#39;s certain is that the chasm between birds and mammals is not uncrossable.<br><br> No single intervention will quash H5N1&#39;s potential pandemic threat. Avian-flu vaccines <i>have</i> been developed for humans, but for now, Trovão, of the Fogarty International Center, told me, the priority is keeping the virus out of cramped, often unsanitary communities of mammals where it could rack up further mutations. Vaccinating poultry, too, would help, says Mariette Ducatez, a virologist at the National Veterinary School of Toulouse. The practice is already relatively common in countries where avian influenza is endemic, including China, Egypt, and Vietnam. This fall, France is likely to introduce shots for a subset of its domesticated birds; regulators in the US have mulled eventually doing the same.<br><br> But avian-flu vaccines can be expensive, difficult to administer, and better at tempering disease severity than blocking spread. Without vigilant monitoring, the virus could spread silently in vaccinated flocks, especially those with spotty coverage, where the microbe could be pressured to evolve in new ways. On the global market, many poultry buyers are also reluctant to import vaccinated birds.<br><br> The stakes for vaccinating wild animals are less economic but no less fraught. And although researchers believe that the recently inoculated California condors are tolerating the new shots well, other species aren&#39;t necessarily next in line. In most cases, vaccinating wild animals just isn&#39;t practical, Trovão told me. Even for the condors, which are already closely monitored by scientists and used to frequent human contact, shots are “not sustainable, really, not long term,” Samantha Gibbs, a wildlife veterinarian at US Fish and Wildlife, told me. Scientists still can&#39;t say for sure how well the vaccines will work in the birds or how long protection might last. “This was a last resort,” Gibbs said, “just an attempt to get them through this.”<br><br> But with H5N1 still raging and the birds still vulnerable, Gibbs and her team suspect that they&#39;ll have little choice but to continue vaccinating the condors on an annual basis.

The green light illuminates one second <i>before</i> the operator presses the button. No one can outwit it, because it works by reading the operator&#39;s predetermined behaviors before they&#39;re apparent to the operator themselves.<br><br> At first, people goof around with the device as a simple amusement. But in time, its effects on many users clearly become serious, because they realize from playing with it that free will is an illusion. As a result, a third of the population develops a pathology known as “akinetic mutism,” a kind of walking coma in which all motivation is absent from life. Some are hospitalized because they won&#39;t feed themselves. Without free will, it seems, people do not feel they are truly alive.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2023/06/generative-ai-future-training-models/674478/">Read: AI is an existential threat to itself</a><br><br> That account is fiction, but we are living in a time when science and philosophy present fresh challenges to the existence of free will. Just as Chiang&#39;s story suggests, this has profound implications for happiness. Understanding the arguments at play, and deciding how to respond, can make a big difference in your life.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he question of</span> free will arises from what philosophers call the “mind-body problem,” which asks whether the mind and the brain are the same thing or separate entities. The philosopher René Descartes famously wrestled with this conundrum in his 1641 <i>Meditations on First Philosophy</i> , arguing that the mind occupies no physical space and is thus distinct from the body.<br><br> This “dualist” view has had many modern adherents, both religious and secular. For example, the Australian philosopher David Chalmers believes that the mind is not physical or material; he posits that one <i>could</i> exist physically without consciousness, like a zombie, so consciousness must exist outside the material realm.<br><br> If this is true, where does the mind reside, if not in the brain? Some might say that the mind is in the soul—or is the soul itself—which, if not physical, might exist beyond physical death. Others point to a kind of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://iep.utm.edu/panpsych/#:~:text=Panpsychism%20is%20the%20view%20that,psyche%20(soul%20or%20mind).">panpsychism</a> , or a degree of consciousness that inhabits all natural bodies. But whatever the mind is and wherever it resides, we seem to possess an essence that enables us to make <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763419300739?casa_token=QFM2udG0V5EAAAAA:KE-u5v8ZxU4vXbpNikvV30-2e8ohJ4rJ1kiN4RDtSy5vJGBq3BcisF7hu4sXQ7spSJH5Tgo4">decisions</a> in our daily lives, an expression of independent choice, of free will. A useful metaphor for this view is that the brain is the computer and the mind is the operator.<br><br> In contrast to all of this, a school of “physicalists” believes that subjective experiences and consciousness emanate entirely from the brain, and that the separateness of brain and mind is an illusion. To revert to the metaphor, no external operator exists.<br><br> <em>Want to hear more from Arthur C. Brooks?

But this isn&#39;t proof that the mind doesn&#39;t exist. After all, we believe that the universe is a purely physical phenomenon as well, even if we still do not fully understand it. To say that the mind is separate from the brain simply because the connections are unknown, the logic goes, doesn&#39;t make sense.<br><br> This logic also explains why so many physicalists reject the concept of free will. As the Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S9pqdKP9tuk">puts it</a> , “What we call &#39;free will&#39; is simply the biology that we haven&#39;t understood well enough yet.” Furthermore, these thinkers cite evidence that many of what we consider to be voluntary actions are initiated before we are even aware of them. After all, our brains contain about <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hms.harvard.edu/news/new-field-neuroscience-aims-map-connections-brain">86 billion neurons</a> , with an estimated 100 trillion links among them. The activity and connections are—pun intended—mind-bogglingly complex, far beyond the conscious control of your lumbering will. By the time you decide to eat that cookie, your brain has already initiated the action to do so.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/12/how-sleep-deprivation-decays-the-mind-and-body/282395/">Read: How sleep deprivation decays the mind and body</a><br><br> A hybrid argument for free will does exist, one that acknowledges both the complexity of the brain and the fact that we might not make every individual decision freely. It suggests that decisions influencing the patterns of everyday life might run automatically. So you may not, in any meaningful sense, <i>choose</i> a certain route to work every day, but you did freely choose to take a job in Tucson instead of Tacoma, limiting your overall range of commuting possibilities. More seriously, you might make moral commitments based on careful consideration, but that in turn constrains your subsequent behavioral choices, which you make automatically.<br><br> W <span class="smallcaps">e aren&#39;t going to</span> sort out the puzzle of free will here. I have my hunches about all of the theories, and you have yours, but they are just that. The question at hand is how best, allowing for this uncertainty, to act to improve your happiness. The answer, doubts notwithstanding, is to embrace the idea of your own free will over your actions and life. This is a pragmatic strategy, similar to Blaise Pascal&#39;s famous <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pascal-wager/">wager</a> about belief in God: You should believe, because if you are wrong, you lose little, but if you are right (and live accordingly), you have a huge amount to gain.<br><br> Social scientists have demonstrated that a belief in free will is associated with life satisfaction, as studies have shown among <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886922001210?casa_token=a9Bue08pL9QAAAAA:J39CRbQHHBh1Ypd2YLiLhvoghV3dH7TFhTtCbFVeGN7HkB4ROfDCP28wOzk--RxcGxqhiNbP">adolescents</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1948550609351600?casa_token=qAIM1G6HVusAAAAA:qsSDTydIURvpUt1dENjee_q1-Ydk6r1ZVqsTiue5eHXNn8XYevWagoUT2jEx-M1mZcyacLKPJHxnww">adults</a> .

Furthermore, this belief can affect anyone, because people whose belief in free will was found to be weaker in research studies tended to score higher than others in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0146167208327217?casa_token=hwirSctQpiAAAAAA:rcjxk9qfCZ21sxT-tUztGyCiZF2dCNOEvjA_Id0kqnd96pkXnAlGz8mBIN2zPTPdpYYYmGHJtHZA8A">aggression</a> and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103112001825?casa_token=-5AUW0kHduAAAAAA:5N87zBgSW-CTktQc5RWUs5uuOR9ThLmRfaZyVHuhm5uzz9wBv15ea6DanmpWr0_jyfqcaOFIUGU">social conformity</a> , and have lower <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053810012001171?casa_token=mfscj-N2wrUAAAAA:NkANiMuP02lubO2EyrnmdNrFW2N5_tkrPaP3NbUbhWwv0pXtoK86A-rpSx1xrfY1d3T7Ml6MifE">self-control</a> .<br><br> Regardless of their underlying beliefs, when people are simply exposed to statements about free will, that influences their attitudes toward life. In an experiment written up in the journal <i>Philosophical Psychology</i> in 2016, scholars asked participants to read either statements affirming free will, such as “I have feelings of regret when I make bad decisions because I know that ultimately I am responsible for my actions,” or statements denying free will, such as “All behavior is determined by brain activity, which in turn is determined by a combination of environmental and genetic factors.” The researchers <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09515089.2014.996285?casa_token=ZVRPiqp8fg8AAAAA%3AvIiDNbNdte0qNV9_5tFx3t3OEiHB8mmJiISGwVGNqh3_nVEXoB06ajZOD7zUB-pJyrlfQ2yqg9QNbA">found</a> that after reading the pro-free-will statements, people set more meaning-filled goals for themselves. After reading the anti-free-will statements, the participants in a parallel study perceived less meaning in their lives.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/05/financial-biological-determinism/239527/">Read: financial biological determinism</a><br><br> If you are a firm believer in free will, well … lucky you. You can try affirming this belief as you start each day by telling yourself, “This is a day of choices—to love or to hate, to give or to take, to move forward or backward in my life. I will make the better choice whenever I can.” When you feel upset or angry, remember that your feelings may happen to you, but that you can manage your reactions to those feelings.<br><br> Even if you are not so sure that free will is real, you can still benefit from acting as if it is, as the research shows. You don&#39;t have to walk around all day hoping that your environmental and genetic proclivities conspire to give you a pleasant day. On the contrary, conjuring thoughts of free will can inspire you to take control of your life in a positive way. If you are a hybrid thinker, that might mean focusing on your major goals in life, which you believe really are under your control.<br><br> T <span class="smallcaps">he strategy I&#39;m proposing</span> turns out to be similar to the one that Ted Chiang settled on in his story. The narrator, using the same technology that the Predictor exemplifies, is communicating with readers from one year in the future. Looking at the destruction that occurs when people conclude they have no free will, he tells them, “My message to you is this: pretend that you have free will.” In sum: “The reality isn&#39;t important: what&#39;s important is your belief.”<br><br> If the mind-body problem were truly settled, I doubt that we could follow this prescription. But the problem isn&#39;t settled, so your decisions might very well be real and matter very much. In which case, my best advice is to admit that you don&#39;t know, throw up your hands in resignation, laugh at the riddle, and make positive decisions about the day ahead.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/happiness-free-will-mind-body-problem/674883/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/happiness-free-will-mind-body-problem/674883/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How the Recession Doomers Got the U.S. Economy So Wrong]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> One year ago, experts were certain that America was headed for a recession.

No, not 99.99 percent, as in the odds that you&#39;ll avoid being struck by lighting this evening. One hundred<i> </i>percent, as in the odds that you&#39;ll avoid falling into a time-bending wormhole that spits you out in 17th-century Versailles at a dinner table with Louis XIV.<br><br> Bloomberg&#39;s bot wasn&#39;t unique in its gloom, either. The Federal Reserve itself <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/business/economy/3912631-fed-projects-jobless-rate-to-reach-4-5-percent-by-end-of-2023/">projected</a> hundreds of thousands of job losses by this December. In a survey by the Philadelphia Fed that has been conducted since the late 1960s, the number of economists anticipating an imminent recession hit <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wheres-the-recession-we-were-promised-cd68a992">an all-time high</a> last year, meaning the level of expert pessimism was greater than before the stagflation crisis of the 1970s, the brutal recession of the early 1980s, and the Great Recession of 2008. Economic glumness spread to the C-suite. Last year, a KPMG <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/ceos-see-tougher-recession-kpmg">poll</a> found that nine in 10 chief executives anticipated a recession in 2023. Republicans eagerly piled on, proactively <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://waysandmeans.house.gov/survey-economists-expect-biden-recession-slowing-growth-job-losses/">blaming</a> the White House for a “Cruel Biden Recession” that all the experts seemingly claimed was inevitable.<br><br> And how&#39;d those experts do? So far, terribly. We&#39;re now in the back half of a year that was supposedly doomed, and the US economy isn&#39;t just narrowly avoiding a downturn. As the writer Noah Smith <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/if-this-is-a-bad-economy-please-tell">points out</a> , nearly everything you should want to go well in an economy is going <i>quite</i> well right now.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/03/us-economy-recession-interest-rates-inflation/673238/">Annie Lowrey: The reason the recession hasn&#39;t happened yet</a><br><br> Employment is high, inflation is falling, real incomes are rising, and inequality is narrowing. Superlatives abound. The official unemployment rate is near a 60-year low, and the jobless rate for Black Americans recently hit an all-time low. The US has the fastest growth rate <i>and</i> the lowest annual inflation of any G7 country. Yes, problems exist. Essentials such as housing, education, and health care are still too expensive; wages could be growing faster; and last year&#39;s inflation is still baked into today&#39;s prices. But mostly, things are good—for now.<br><br> In fairness, economists had some fine reasons to expect a rough 2023. When inflation surged to multi-decade highs, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates. As economists, including Larry Summers, pointed out, deploying high rates to combat high inflation has historically been a simple recipe for a recession. The logic is straightforward. Higher interest rates increase the cost of capital, which reduces investment, which blunts hiring, which reduces wage growth, which depresses spending, and ta-da, you&#39;ve produced an economic downturn that cools prices.<br><br> But that&#39;s not how 2023 has gone at all. Instead, we seem very close to something like “immaculate disinflation”—an unusual case of falling inflation without rising unemployment. So what, exactly, might experts have gotten so wrong? How did we beat a serious case of inflation without, to date, triggering a downturn?<br><br> The first explanation is that economic prediction has always been more sorcery than science. Since the Philly Fed survey started in 1968, the majority of economists have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/economists-think-they-can-see-recession-comingfor-a-change-11670150634?mod=article_inline">failed</a> to anticipate <i>every single</i> recession. Less than a third of economists foresaw the 1990 and 2001 downturns, and they whiffed on the 2008 crash. Economic models of the future are perhaps best understood as astrology faintly decorated with calculus equations.<br><br> The second explanation is that the US economy bravely withstood a number of shocks—and then the shocks went away. JP Morgan&#39;s Michael Cembalest <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://assets.jpmprivatebank.com/content/dam/jpm-wm-aem/global/pb/en/insights/eye-on-the-market/rasputin-effect.pdf">wrote</a> that the economy&#39;s resilience reminds him of Rasputin, the Russian mystic who survived poisoning, several beatings, and a few shootings. Similarly, the US economy has endured a gauntlet of pain: a wild surge in post-pandemic spending on stuff like cars and electronics, and then broken supply chains that couldn&#39;t handle all this new demand, a historic increase in resignations as the service sector came back online, a spike in energy prices after the initial invasion of Ukraine, a run on real estate that depleted inventory, and don&#39;t forget the slowdown in China and, of course, rocketing interest rates. That&#39;s a lot! The shocks came from all over: high demand, low supply, geopolitics, international shipping, Vladimir Putin&#39;s imperial mania. But eventually, the pain subsided, and the Rasputin-esque US economy is alive today because the tortuous inflation surprises have mostly dissipated.<br><br> This explanation leaves out the Federal Reserve entirely. And perhaps that&#39;s telling. One cheeky lesson of the past 15 years might be that monetary policy is weaker than most experts thought at both stimulating and depressing growth. During the 2010s, the Obama administration (constrained by Republican intransigence) leaned on the Fed and low interest rates to lift the moribund economy, but economic growth was rather putrid anyway. If the Fed wasn&#39;t strong enough then to stimulate an economy suffering from depressed demand, and isn&#39;t strong enough now to depress an economy overstimulated by high inflation, maybe we need a new theory of just how important interest rates are to overall economic health.<br><br> But as the writer Matt Yglesias <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://substack.com/app-link/post?publication_id=159185&amp;post_id=135591949&amp;utm_source=post-email-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxNTc1NjEsInBvc3RfaWQiOjEzNTU5MTk0OSwiaWF0IjoxNjkwOTcwNzExLCJleHAiOjE2OTM1NjI3MTEsImlzcyI6InB1Yi0xNTkxODUiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.IbM9Wi_MGubnI3j4fIA6Cywv-CMhsQV2d376dsQTLlI">points out</a> , another interpretation of the past two years gives the Fed a bit more credit. The central bank is not just a mute wizard with a joystick that raises and lowers interest rates. Central bankers talk. Their talking shapes expectations, moods, <i>vibes</i> . The chair of the Federal Reserve is the chief vibemeister of the US economy, and conceivably the combination of his statements and his actions has maneuvered the US economy into the Goldilocks zone by making Americans <i>just anxious enough</i> to throttle consumer spending and wage growth while other economic disruptions went away.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/inflation-jobs-unemployment-recession/674593/">Adam Ozimek: The simple mistake that almost triggered a recession</a><br><br> I like this idea. For the past few months, I&#39;ve been puzzling over a related mystery, which is why ordinary Americans are so convinced that the economy is terrible. In April, just as unemployment hit a 60-year low, a record-high share of the public <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/public-pessimism-on-the-economy-hits-a-new-high-cnbc-survey-shows.html">expressed</a> negative views of the economy. Now, Jeff Bezos famously said that “when the anecdotes and the data disagree, the anecdotes are usually right.” But Americans&#39; feelings have been factually disconnected from reality. This summer, nearly half of Americans said we were in a recession, which is just incorrect. In April, Americans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/18/public-pessimism-on-the-economy-hits-a-new-high-cnbc-survey-shows.html">said</a> it was the worst time to buy stocks in almost 20 years. But the S&amp;P 500 had surged 14 percent in six months leading up to April, and stocks are up another 11 percent since then.<br><br> Discounting the pessimism of tens of millions of Americans would be crass. But something important and weird is going on here. The writer Kyla Scanlon has memorably diagnosed what we&#39;re experiencing as a “vibecession,” in which people are happily contributing to a growing economy even as they externalize the vague anxiety that everything is about to fall apart. In a similar vein, I wrote an article titled <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/06/american-economy-negative-perception-inflation/661149/">“&#39;Everything Is Terrible, but I&#39;m Fine,&#39;”</a> noting that people in surveys keep saying they are depressed about the state of the national economy but hopeful (and even happy) about the state of their household economy.<br><br> At this point, you might be thinking, <i>Wait, what does all of this have to do with our central question?</i> Well, here&#39;s a complex and unprovable theory: Maybe the recession doomers got the economy very wrong precisely because they were so convincing. A sense of economic dusk took the edge off spending, hiring, and wage growth, and that, in turn, reduced inflation without as yet causing a full-blown recession.<br><br> So, this is my favorite theory: The vibecession prevented the real recession. In medicine, weaker versions of a virus, like the flu, inoculate people against the real thing. By analogy, Fed Chair Jerome Powell and his melancholy minions essentially administered an injection of mostly safe gloom into the economic bloodstream, which seems to have triggered just the right level of macroeconomic immune response to reduce inflation without causing a downturn.<br><br> Or maybe all of these theories are true at once. Economic forecasts are genre fiction. America Rasputined its way out of the crisis years. The Fed&#39;s titrated pessimism successfully reduced inflation at the margins. And maybe the very act of writing this article guarantees that we&#39;ll have a recession at the end of this year.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Thu, 03 Aug 2023 10:00:00

年总统选举的合法结果并保留权力”的努力，并以特朗普明知是虚假的选民欺诈指控为借口。他的一位顾问说，“阴谋论从母舰上传下来。”除了毫无根据地指控选举舞弊这种不负责任但受到言论自由保护的行为之外，特朗普和他的顾问们还策划了一个又一个离奇的计划，通过推翻选举来非法夺取权力。如果你想了解尽管发生了这一切，特朗普为何仍能再次当选总统，你只需要看看他的主要竞争对手和保守派媒体的反应就可以了。<br><br>

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/stephen-miller-alarming-emails/602242/">坚定的政治先锋</a>可以产生超出其人数的影响力，特别是考虑到它在主流共和党圈子中的接受度越来越高。<br><br>然而，大多数保守派精英仍然保留着对民主和自治的一些哲学承诺。然而，他们一再未能通过最基本的民主公民考验，捍卫公众选择领导人的权利。右翼媒体故意助长保守派选民的错觉，认为选举被窃取<a

href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/fox-news-dominion-lawsuit-trump/673132/">，是因为担心他们的观众会逃离</a>。共和党议员，现在包括特朗普自己的主要对手，都证实了这样一种观点，即特朗普是政治迫害的受害者，而不是参与阴谋保住自己权力的人，因为他们担心反对他的选举成本。由于自己的怯懦而动弹不得，这两个群体都无限期地受到他的奴役。<br><br><a
