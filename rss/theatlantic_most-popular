18 人，指控其密谋推翻该州 2020 年总统选举结果。被指控的同谋提醒人们，像特朗普这样的人是受到小人物的支持，这些小人物可能与特朗普本人一样对民主构成威胁。<br><br>首先，这是来自<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>的三个新故事：<br><br><li><a

2020 年大选中带头推翻该州选民的意愿。关于特朗普本人，我们可以说的不多了：我们只能多次指出，他是一个<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/09/donald-trump-not-well/597640/">情绪失常的</a>人，被狂野的不安全感所困扰，用退休联邦法官 J·迈克尔·卢蒂格 (J. <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/conservative-retired-judge-says-trump-corroded-and-corrupted-american-democracy">Michael Luttig)</a>的话说，他的行为“腐蚀并损害了特朗普的利益”。腐败的美国民主。”因此，让我们把他放在一边，转向他在佐治亚州被指控的同谋（ <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2023/08/trump-indictment-charges-overturn-2020-election/674887/">特别检察官杰克史密斯的起诉书</a>中似乎提到了其中至少五人，指控特朗普密谋推翻 2020 年大选结果，尽管史密斯还没有向他们收费）。<br><br>佐治亚州的起诉书描述了一个看起来很像多层次营销计划的所谓诈骗，其中负责人（特朗普、他的律师鲁迪·朱利安尼和他的前幕僚长马克·梅多斯）有他们想要出售的东西（在这种情况下，选举谎言）。他们出去招募一支容易上当、雄心勃勃的销售队伍来传播信息（依靠律师西德尼·鲍威尔和詹娜·埃利斯等忠诚者），然后这些人又拉拢另一群销售者（州立法者、选举官员、州党官员和政府官员）。其他的）。走得足够远，你就会发现那些愿意充当假选举人的标记。最终，他们都与假冒产品联系在一起，这将损害他们的声誉，甚至可能损害他们的自由。<br><br>但我们不应该因为所谓的阴谋的愚蠢而分心。佐治亚州案件是了解特朗普的支持者和朝臣行动的一个重要窗口，这些前总统周围的平庸之人决心获得他们认为应得的尊重和地位，无论他们的实际才能如何。我们大多数人都像普通人一样过着普通的生活，做着普通的工作。并不是每一个职业都是令人满意的，正如我的工薪阶层父亲常说的那样，即使是好莱坞演员也可能在某些时候讨厌他们的工作，因为他们不得不从床上爬起来，坐在化妆椅上。用了几个小时。 （我对真实演员工作的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2023/05/succession-america-decides-tom-nichols/674060/">一次尝试</a>证实了这一明智的观察。）<br><br>然而，自从踏入政坛以来，特朗普一直扮演着这个充满怨恨的第三集团的守护神角色。例如，埃利斯的法律职业生涯始于科罗拉多州乡村司法管辖区的副检察官。正如<i>《</i><i>纽约时报》</i>在 2020 年<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/us/politics/jenna-ellis-trump.html">指出的</a>那样，她很快在电视上将自己推销为“宪法律师”，尽管缺乏经验“对她展现自己作为权威人物的能力没有明显影响”。与特朗普不同，这些人并不是传奇人物。事实上，他们最显着的特征是他们每个人都是多么渺小、多么奇怪和多么无能——然而，从起诉书来看，他们作为一个群体是多么危险。<br><br>在被告中，只有梅多斯和朱利安尼是全国性人物。 （鲍威尔之所以出名，主要是因为他在福克斯新闻上发表言论，兜售一些连福克斯管理层和主持人都认为<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/09/26/was-rudy-giuliani-always-so-awful">充分记录</a>。就梅多斯而言，他似乎只是另一位沉迷于首都生活的政客，他的朋友和敌人都<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/24/us/politics/jeffrey-clark-trump-election.html">，肩上有专业的筹码</a>。他也可能愿意成为对其同胞的威胁。根据史密斯的起诉书，当时任白宫副法律顾问帕特里克·菲尔宾（Patrick Philbin）警告“同谋 4”（似乎是克拉克）时，如果特朗普以某种方式在任期结束后继续执政，就会爆发骚乱，同谋 4 <a data-event-element="inline link"

)。她被指控试图向佐治亚州选举工作人员鲁比·弗里曼施压，要求其做出虚假陈述。 （弗里曼和她的女儿兼选举同事沙耶·莫斯（Shaye Moss）成为特朗普及其打手小队的目标后， <a data-event-element="inline link"

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/georgia-prosecutor-showed-no-semblance-restraint-trump-says-turley-excessive-dangerous">相关媒体</a>似乎对这些行为是否构成<i>犯罪</i>存在争议。<i> </i>（在今天发布的一份声明中，特朗普的律师<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/4153028-trump-attorneys-call-events-before-georgia-indictment-shocking/">表示</a>，佐治亚州的起诉书“无疑与整个程序一样有缺陷且违宪。”）<br><br>尽管如此，如果没有特朗普，这些人中的大多数人永远不会远离国家权力的杠杆。当特朗普输了，他们就输了。代表权力和影响力的铜环——也许最重要的是尊重——被从他们手中夺走了几英寸。他们现在都拥有了自己渴望的重要性，但可能并不像他们期望的那样。<br><br><b>有关的：</b><br><br><li>

eBay、Craigslist 和亚马逊上的瓶子售价高达<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.sfgate.com/food/article/san-francisco-senor-sisig-sriracha-stolen-18156771.php">从当地餐馆偷酱汁</a>。<br><br>短缺的很大一部分原因可以归咎于汇丰脆弱的供应链。赋予酱汁柑橘甜味的红色墨西哥辣椒对温度很挑剔，通常是手工采摘的。很大一部分辣椒也生长在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/business/sriracha-shortage-huy-fong.html">墨西哥北部</a>特别干旱的地区，那里的许多田地都用<a data-event-element="inline link"

href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-06-26/sriracha-shortage-climate-change-mexico-drought">水</a>灌溉，而科罗拉多河本身就是一种紧张且竞争激烈的资源。但专家告诉我，所有这一切都只是为最后的气候打击做好准备：近年来墨西哥<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/150691/la-nina-times-three">遭受</a>了<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2023/jul/02/sriracha-hot-sauce-shortage-mexico-drought">严重的干旱</a>，水库的排水量如此之低，以至于连用于农业的水也基本上被封锁了。<br><br>拉差短缺并不是气候变化引发的最严重的农作物危机。多年来， <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/dining/farming-climate-change.html">密歇根州的樱桃</a>一直在过高的温度下窒息，而<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/01/climate-crisis-us-food-system-five-crops">佛罗里达州的柑橘</a>则被飓风摧毁。印度的小麦作物被<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.fas.usda.gov/data/india-india-extreme-temperatures-scorch-indian-wheat-production">烤焦</a>，而世界各地的水稻则受到<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/05/20/climate/rice-farming-climate-change.html">洪水和热浪</a>的双重打击。但现在看到辣椒处于危险之中是它自己的特殊烧伤。辣椒生长于世界上一些最温暖的地区，长期以来一直是耐热性的典范。与许多其他植物相比，它们应该没问题。不过现在，随着气温变得更加炎热，干旱继续席卷地球，“我认为我们会更频繁地看到这种情况，”墨西哥国立自治大学的气候科学家吉列尔莫·穆雷-托塔罗洛告诉我。是拉差的麻烦可能会成为未来更加无趣的时代的风向标。<br><br>目前，大多数辣椒作物<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/13/business/sriracha-shortage-huy-fong.html">仍长势良好</a>。加州大学戴维斯分校的胡椒育种专家艾伦·范·迪恩泽 (Allen Van Deynze) 告诉我，在经历了去年夏天残酷的热浪之后，作为西方世界胡椒种植热点之一的加利福尼亚州的几个地区现在迎来了丰收的一年。就连去年导致墨西哥红辣椒田被毁的干旱状况也已从最糟糕的情况有所改善。辣椒植物很难被压垮。 “除非你的夜晚温度高于 60 度，而白天温度为 80 或 85 度，否则他们会不高兴，”Van Deynze 说。默里-托塔罗洛告诉我，红墨西哥辣椒一直处于辣椒作物歉收的最前沿，因为它们是不寻常的<em>冬</em>辣椒，并且在比其他地方的同类辣椒略低的温度下生长得最好。但与其他一些夏季作物相比，即使是它们的理想状态也相当温和：例如，西红柿的生长温度比辣椒喜欢的温度低 10 度，Van Deynze 告诉我。<br><br>许多辣椒育种者实际上倾向于在作物温度范围的上限附近工作。新墨西哥州立大学的辣椒研究员斯蒂芬妮·沃克（Stephanie Walker）表示，辣椒素是一种让辣椒产生舌头刺痛感的化学物质，它是一种植物防御机制，而辣椒“在压力下会增强防御机制”。告诉我。 “我们对人们说，在经历了充满压力的生长年之后，‘我们将会有美味、辛辣、美味的辣椒’”从另一端出来。一些专家还认为，最好明智地对辣椒用水，尤其是在采摘前几周。南伊利诺伊大学的蔬菜科学家斯图尔特·艾伦·沃尔特斯告诉我，过多的灌溉会稀释水果的味道，因此一些农民会选择少量灌溉。<br><br>但超过一定阈值后，辣椒也会开始发出嘶嘶声。一旦温度达到约 90 至 95 度，传粉者就会停止造访；花朵开始死亡，但不会产生果实或种子。尽管少量的水配给可以缓解辣味，但辣椒——像任何其他生命形式一样——如果得不到足够的液体营养就会死亡。当降雨稀少时，维持许多辣椒种植园的灌溉可以起到缓冲作用，但在极端<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.drought.gov/watersheds/colorado">干旱</a>时期，这些水的配给最终也会受到限制。<br><br>辣椒也不能免受已经困扰其他作物的气候相关问题的影响。地球的逐渐变暖已经消除了冬季的许多寒流，这对于依靠寒冷来减少杂草、害虫及其传播的许多疾病数量的农民来说是一个问题。 “这一点非常清楚：我们看到病毒数量大幅增加，”范·迪恩泽告诉我。此外，热浪和干旱会使植物更容易受到花端腐病的影响，这种疾病会使果实的尖端变黑和死亡。沃克告诉我，由于炎热的天气几乎没有喘息的机会，工人们更频繁地发现自己在危险的条件下采摘辣椒。<br><br>对胡椒生产进行一些调整可能会有所帮助。种植者可以将北美的主要辣椒产区转移到更北的地方，以追求更温和的气温。研究人员还已经在努力培育更多耐旱和耐热的植物，以应对未来更加艰难的岁月。但没有任何保证。基因改造可能很慢，而且有时需要权衡：例如，当育种者选择气候适应能力时，他们必须非常小心，避免失去辛辣味，或改变辣椒的标志性风味，默里-托塔罗洛说。沃克告诉我，仍然存在“生理上限”，超过这个上限，即使是最精心培育的植物也无法生长或繁殖。沃克说，很难确切地说上限在哪里。但作为温暖爱好者中的佼佼者，辣椒可能已经比科学家们希望的更接近了。<br><br>辣椒不会很快从地球表面消失。但即使是少数品种的损失和短缺也会带来痛苦。新墨西哥州的哈奇青辣椒已经面临<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.11/south-agriculture-hatch-green-chiles-are-feeling-the-heat">干旱</a>的压力。默里-托塔罗洛对墨西哥一些特别稀有的辣椒品种的未来感到担忧：黑哈瓦那辣椒，一种产自尤卡坦半岛的花香泥土辣椒；

Children]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div>这部热门的澳大利亚动画片毫不犹豫地以孩子们可以理解、父母也会欣赏的方式探索复杂的情感。 <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/fF4dBPaId5B74oX7pCDUOPtxJwU=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/bluey/original.jpg" alt="电视剧《Bluey》中的场景" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption>布鲁伊图片/迪士尼</figcaption></figure>上周，我向妻子提出了一个可能涉及我们许多朋友的问题：“你认为班迪特和辣椒还会再生一个孩子吗？”她想了想，然后摇了摇头。 “可能不会。他们把婴儿床扔了出去，还记得吗？”<br><br>当然。我妻子指的不是她在 Facebook Marketplace 上看到的列表，而是“卧室”，这是澳大利亚儿童节目<em>Bluey</em>第三季中的一集，她和我都看过至少十几次。考虑到我们和两岁的女儿一起一遍又一遍地观看<em>《Bluey》</em> ，我们对《Bluey》的熟悉程度可能比任何其他正在播出的节目都要丰富。但令我惊讶的并不是我们共同的知识，而是我们正在谈论一对卡通狗，就像它们是我们认识的人一样。<br><br>当你有一个年幼的孩子时，你会被动地观看大量儿童电视节目，而我这个沉迷于屏幕的自己会情不自禁地关注它如何提供温和的生活课程或充满活力的情感冲动。但甚至在我女儿出生之前，家长朋友就经常称<em>《Bluey》</em>为儿童节目，比其他节目更胜一筹。三个多季以来，该剧因有关拟人化澳大利亚狗家庭 Heelers 的深思熟虑<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jul/12/still-the-best-television-series-in-the-world-bluey-is-back-disney-plus">、</a>有趣的冒险故事而<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/08/bluey-disney-plus-parents.html">广受</a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.vulture.com/2021/05/bluey-best-kids-tv-show.html">赞誉</a>：爸爸 Bandit、妈妈 Chilli 以及他们的女儿 Bluey（6 岁）和 Bingo（4 岁）。它的许多剧集证实了该剧故事讲述的令人印象深刻的深度，以一种儿童节目真正不需要为成人做的方式奖励我的深入审查。<br><br>大多数剧集（每集大约七分钟）都集中在布鲁伊正在玩的游戏上，通常是与她的家人或她的一些学校朋友一起玩，他们住在一个类似布里斯班的城市，那里居住着各种可以想象的品种的双足会说话的狗。该节目颂扬富有想象力的游戏和 Bluey 的无限活力，因为她的父母尽最大努力跟上她奇特的即兴创作（尤其是 Bandit，他无穷无尽的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/humor/daily-shouts/blueys-dad-thinks-hes-so-great">随心所欲</a>的能力让大多数父母感到羞愧）。但游戏并不是一切——角色的描绘足够丰富，以至于我开始认为父母们正在经历和我一样的痛苦。<br><br>在第三季（也是最新一季）的一集《牧羊犬》中，明显劳累过度的辣椒在准备晚餐后，向强盗提出了一个任何家长都可能认识的请求。 “我需要 20 分钟没人靠近我，”她严厉地说，他毫不犹豫地承认了这一点。这个要求让布鲁伊感到困惑，她在这一集中的剩余时间里试图问她的母亲她做错了什么。当然，我们的教训是，一切都没有错——有时成年人只<em>需要 20 分钟</em>。但这是一个比大多数儿童电视敢于尝试的更微妙的前提来构建一集。像<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/07/the-daniel-tiger-doctrine/565187/"><em>《丹尼尔·泰格》</em></a>这样的节目虽然很有帮助，但并没有试图解释父母在日常生活中短暂的疲倦感。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/12/rob-delaney-a-heart-that-works-book-excerpt/672566/">阅读：帮助我垂死的儿子沟通的电视节目</a><br><br>这就是<em>《Bluey》</em>的大胆之处，该剧主要由其创作者乔·布鲁姆 (Joe Brumm) 撰写：它相信年轻观众也能够理解有关父母的缺点和不安全感的故事。第二季的一集名为“爷爷”，讲述了布鲁伊和宾果与脾气暴躁的爷爷一起在澳大利亚丛林中奔跑的故事，同时也讲述了辣椒对父亲年事已高的焦虑，以及他不想放慢脚步的固执。精彩的《粘壁虎》是巴斯特·基顿式的小闹剧，辣椒在努力让她的孩子们出去玩耍时。但它也有一个让我措手不及的随意时刻，正如奇利回忆的那样，当布鲁伊出生时，他们即将去看望的孩子们的母亲给她做了五份烤宽面条。 “这对我来说意义重大！”她感叹道，表达了意外得到一位亲密朋友的照顾所带来的深深的甜蜜，这种感觉是我作为新手父母所珍惜的。<br><br>情感的特异性与肢体幽默的精确度和世界建筑的密度同样重要。 <em>Bluey</em>是地球上任何地方的幼儿都能理解的生动表演，但它也是当代育儿的特殊代表。它是从孩子的角度讲述的，超现实魔法的闪光可以渗透到布鲁伊的现实中，但它也总是非常现实地把任何家庭车辆的后座描绘成完全<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/kateyrich/status/1550106088300740612?lang=en">散落着垃圾</a>。<br><br>上个月在美国播出的最新剧集强调了该剧在构建海勒家族之外的宇宙方面也取得了巨大成功，采用了不同的叙事惯例，并突出了更广泛的群体中的角色。 “故事”这一集重点讲述了布鲁伊在学校的同学以及他们在手工项目中遇到的挫折； 《连体衣》由罗丝·拜恩客串出演，介绍了辣椒的妹妹布兰迪，并间接但有力地探讨了她因无法生育而与家庭的疏远。<br><br>这些叙事转向不一定适合七分钟儿童节目的公式，其中首要任务始终是吸引孩子的注意力（这不是一件容易的事）。<em>布鲁伊</em>做到了这一点，却没有感到自命不凡或粗暴，这简直令人震惊。一系列新剧集已经在澳大利亚播出，虽然我的孩子对我们能看到的大约 140 集感到非常满意，但我已经等不及更多了——不仅仅是为了多样性，也是为了看看电视上最精彩的剧集在哪里。接下来将推出出乎意料的雄心勃勃的节目。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 15:34:48 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/judge-rejects-trump-effort-to-move-new-york-criminal-case-to-federal-court/">因为它在 7 月份的纽约没有起作用</a>，但一旦发生，有两件事是肯定的：它会引起我们的注意，并且会带来拖延的可能性——这是特朗普最喜欢的策略。联邦法律规定，如果州法院开始的起诉涉及“美国任何官员”“以该职位名义”采取的“任何行为”，则可以在 30 天内<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1442#a">“移交”联邦法院</a>。<br><br>根据最高法院长期以来的<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/489/121/">判例</a>，这一要求意味着该行为必须涉及该官员的工作表现，并且该官员必须针对刑事指控提出“有色彩的联邦辩护”。从本质上讲，这两个因素将融合在特朗普声称一直代表美国行事、试图改变格鲁吉亚选举结果的声明中。他将辩称，他只是在履行总统的职责，确保佐治亚州依法进行计票。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/trump-georgia-indictment-election/675018/">大卫·A·格雷厄姆：佐治亚州的起诉书提供了全貌</a><br><br>特朗普冒充选举进程的联邦保护者确实很讽刺。特朗普根据驱逐法向联邦法院寻求庇护的历史讽刺也是如此。<br><br>今天的驱逐法规可以追溯到内战前夕。国会颁布了一项前身法规，以<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.americanbar.org%2Fgroups%2Fgpsolo%2Fpublications%2Fgpsolo_ereport%2F2022%2Fapril-2022%2Fto-remove-or-not-remove-look-federal-officer-removal-statute%2F&amp;data=05%7C01%7Cltribe%40kaplanhecker.com%7Cb984774f1acc4577200408db1d85398f%7C1e4b3f30f28846caa093d033aa3a7c4a%7C0%7C0%7C638136230315641533%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&amp;sdata=QFo5eQ27F2z5RRy5bMkmCm1W8AgQq3uK%2FbrsIsSncSM%3D&amp;reserved=0">保护</a>联邦法律的实施，防止南方各州试图通过逮捕和起诉履行其职能的人来破坏联邦。然而现在，特朗普将援引该法规来保护自己免受州起诉，州起诉试图追究他对宪法造成的损害的责任，侵犯了各州选择自己总统选举人的权利和义务。<br><br>特朗普永远不会被讽刺所吓倒，他可能会走这条路，无论其成功的前景如何有限，因为如果案件转移到联邦法院，它可能会减慢进展速度，而这是他的诉讼首选。每失去一周，我们就会危险地距离下一次总统选举更近。<br><br>但如果他成功的话，他将有机会参加由整个佐治亚州北区组成的陪审团，而不仅仅是来自位于紫蓝色亚特兰大的富尔顿县。陪审团成员包括富尔顿的八个邻近县，其中包括<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://twitter.com/Victorshi2020/status/1600283454007955456">该州最红的</a>县之一，这很可能是特朗普的目标，因为他相信陪审团很可能包括无论证据如何都倾向于无罪释放的“永远的特朗普”信徒。<br><br>此外，特朗普可能会任命一位友好的法官来主持审判——从特朗普的角度来看，理想的情况是，他任命自己为佐治亚州北区法官的四名法官之一。此外，他的律师肯定会看到迫使州检察官在一个不熟悉的联邦论坛上进行诉讼可能带来的策略上的好处。<br><br>威利斯可能会出于特朗普采取这一举措的所有原因而反对这一举措。好消息是，她预期的将案件退回州法院的动议最终会获得通过。<br><br>富尔顿县的起诉书指控特朗普以多种方式刑事干预佐治亚州总统选举人的选举。其中最主要的是他在 2021 年 1 月 2 日给佐治亚州国务卿布拉德·拉芬斯伯格 (Brad Raffensperger) 打电话时录制的臭名昭著的录音。在那次电话中，特朗普向拉芬斯佩格<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/03/us/politics/trump-raffensperger-call-georgia.html">施压</a>，要求他“找到 11,780 张选票”——这超出了推翻总统乔·拜登获得佐治亚州 16 张选举人票所需的数量。特朗普甚至错误地暗示，如果拉芬斯佩格没有“找到”这些选票，他可能会面临刑事指控。<br><br>然后就是<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/27/us/politics/fake-electors-explained-trump-jan-6.html">假选举人计划</a>。特朗普的 2020 年竞选活动在佐治亚州以及其他六个州进行了竞选活动，目的是在 2021 年 1 月 6 日制造一场虚假的争端，这将导致国会拒绝或推迟对拜登当选的认证。<br><br>这两种形式的干预表明了可能的“罢免”动议的一个主要障碍：无论是他给拉芬斯佩格的电话，还是通过煽动毫无根据的选举人名争夺来阻碍国会会议的阴谋，都不在他作为总统的职权范围之内。 。特朗普显然意识到需要表现出相反的态度，他已经在社交媒体上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://truthsocial.com/users/realDonaldTrump/statuses/109876091900766566">植入了</a>这样的想法，即他的总统职责“确保法律得到忠实执行”包括确保所有 50 个州的安全、可靠和公平的选举。<br><br>即使我们接受特朗普确实担心佐治亚州选举结果公平性的观点，他的主张也存在问题：总统在确保选举中遵守法治方面可以发挥的任何作用背景聚焦于 2020 年 11 月 3 日在佐治亚州进行的选票竞选，其中包括一名美国参议员、14 名美国众议员和一批全州公职人员的选举。但宪法和实施宪法的法律刻意赋予美国总统绝对不具有监督作用的那一次选举是由选举人团负责的。<br><br>事实上，我们的宪法选举总统的程序明显将现任总统本人排除在外。选举团制度是指各州的总统选举人名单在州议会大厦得到正式认证，并发送给华盛顿，然后由副总统在华盛顿揭幕，并在 1 月 6 日的特别会议上在众议院和参议院进行计票。联席会议。唐纳德·特朗普承诺在该<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/07/01/trump-capitol-riot-march/">会议</a>上加入他的支持者的行列具有新闻价值，因为它威胁使用暴力，而且因为它违背了宪法明显将总统排除在国会程序之外的规定。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/01/georgia-path-potentially-prosecuting-trump/621326/">大卫·弗伦奇：格鲁吉亚有非常有力的理由反对特朗普</a><br><br>然而，在给拉芬斯佩格的电话以及相关<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/06/23/jan6-doj-clark-rosen-donoghue-testimony/">努力</a>中，特朗普甚至没有声称他正在努力确保任何这些下一轮选举的安全、保障或公平。他唯一关注的是自己在 2020 年 12 月 14 日在亚特兰大举行的选举团投票中落败。<br><br>当然，总统职责的概念不包括威胁州选举官员，以使计票结果<i>对总统有利</i>，也不包括让州官员用假选举人名单取代实际选举人名单。正如华盛顿特区的联邦法院在<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/18/politics/judge-ruling-trump-civil-lawsuit-january-6/index.html"><i>汤普森诉特朗普一</i></a>案中裁定的那样，“没有任何宪法条款或联邦法规……授予……总统……与选举团投票认证有关的任何权力或义务。”<br><br>特朗普的免职请求也因第二个独立原因而失败：他无法为针对他的指控提供“有色彩的”联邦法律辩护。虽然“可着色”辩护只是一种<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/colorable_claim#:~:text=A%20colorable%20claim%20is%20a,actually%20result%20in%20a%20win.">看似合理的</a>辩护，而不是可能成功的辩护，但特朗普无可争议的行为的性质使得他可能考虑的任何可能的联邦法律辩护都极其难以置信。<br><br>特朗普几乎肯定会提出的主要辩护是总统豁免权，即他有权获得绝对保护，免受其担任总统期间所采取行动的法律后果的影响。但正如最高法院在 1982 年裁定的那样，即使在损害赔偿民事诉讼中，对这种豁免权的主张——在刑事案件中是否存在任何这种豁免权仍是一个悬而未决的问题—— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/457/731/#tab-opinion-1954625">也不会超出</a>他的职务职责的“外围”以及“其办公室的特定职能”的履行。为了保住职位而监督州总统选举人的选择，这似乎不属于其中。<br><br>除了主张豁免权之外，特朗普可能会辩称，他在给拉芬斯佩格打电话，甚至在假选举人计划中扮演的角色是在行使第一修正案的权利。任何这样的论点都是法律上的废话。这相当于声称法律将利用言语招揽欺诈或盗窃的行为定为刑事犯罪，这是不允许的限制言论自由。既定的法律（和常识）<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/333/178/">恰恰相反</a>。<br><br>三十年前，最高法院<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/489/121/">规定了</a>联邦官员将起诉从州转移到联邦法院的要求。在这样做时，法院依靠“强有力的司法政策”来反对“对国家施加额外的负担”。那里的法院明确承认，将州案件移交给联邦法院就承担着这样的负担。<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/january-6-indictment-trump-first-amendment/675012/">艾伦·Z·罗森施泰因：第一修正案并不能为特朗普涉嫌犯罪提供辩护</a><br><br>在最近的记忆中，没有一个案例比这起事件更能体现这种担忧。各州对公平和诚实地选择总统选举人负有主要责任，而它们有权追究那些犯下阻碍选举结果罪行的人的责任，这是最优先的事项。<br><br>地区检察官法尼·威利斯 (Fani Willis) 决心履行法治责任，这体现了公务员不畏惧、不偏袒地履行职责的典范。特朗普的做法是史无前例的，因此需要州检察官的积极回应，对前总统执法。<br><br>特朗普虚假声称一直在尽自己的职责，试图推翻选举，并且仅仅因为他当时是总统而获得豁免，这应该被彻底驳回，他将案件移交联邦法院的努力也被否认。这只是他对法治无休止的攻击的最新篇章，他试图阻止法治适用于他自己，就像适用于我们所有人一样。<br><br></div>

class="smallcaps">在超过</span>四分之一个世纪的时间里，彭斯一直是一位尽职尽责、坚定的保守派。他开始在谈话电台工作，他的品牌是“脱咖啡因的拉什·林堡”。在他的第三次尝试中，他成功当选为众议院议员，他很高兴地在乔治·W·布什的两项重大立法成就——“不让一个孩子掉队”和医疗保险扩张——这两项成就上与共和党对抗，而彭斯正是在这两项成就上取得了成功。相信违反了他对某些小政府保守原则的承诺。但共和党人原谅了这些异端邪说。彭斯在众议院共和党领导层中升至第三位。<br><br>彭斯从众议院跃升至印第安纳州州长官邸，最后作为特朗普的竞选搭档获得了总统门票。你知道那是怎么回事：四年来，彭斯为特朗普的言行辩护。在幕后，他试图成为房间里的成年人。在国家电视台上，一只苍蝇停在他脸上。呀呀呀呀呀，然后政变来了。<br><br>此时，特朗普指示数千名支持者“强力”向美国国会大厦游行，阻止彭斯履行宪法规定的统计和核证选举人票的义务——这将使拜登正式成为当选总统。因此，一群最近投票选举彭斯为副总统的非常优秀的人走上宪法大道，架起绞刑架，冲进国会大厦。在这些活动过程中，许多人高呼“绞死迈克·彭斯”。<br><br><span class="smallcaps">就彭斯而言，</span>他对这种不愉快的情况持乐观态度。上个月，当被问及特朗普的最新威胁时——如果他被判有罪，美国将“非常危险”——他否认了这种可能性。彭斯对美国有线电视新闻网 (CNN) 的达纳·巴什 (Dana Bash) <a data-event-element="inline link"

Bash 的发言很简短。 “考虑到 1 月 6 日他们想绞死你，你竟然不关心这件事，这真是太了不起了，”她说。<br><br>彭斯回应道：“这场运动中的人们，那些在 2016 年和 2020 年团结起来支持我们事业的人们，是这个国家最敬畏上帝、最守法、最爱国的人民，我……不会容忍这种行为。”概括性的，因为它们没有事实依据。”<br><br>在美国政治中，从来没有哪个候选人如此尽职尽责地遵循耶稣的指示：“谁打你的脸，连另一个打你的脸。”因此，无论你对迈克·彭斯有什么想说的，我敢打赌，如果一群 MAGA Proud Boys

class="smallcaps">其他</span>国家不太知道如何对待彭斯。他是一个复杂的人物。<br><br>一方面，他容忍并捍卫了特朗普时代的所有掠夺行为。 2016年，他在福音派选民中为特朗普担保，巩固了特朗普对该党的掌控。在弗吉尼亚州夏洛茨维尔之后，他<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.politico.com/story/2017/08/16/mike-pence-supports-trump-charlottesville-241708">支持</a>特朗普。在第一次弹劾期间，他是特朗普的支柱。他<a data-event-element="inline link"

1 月 6 日没有遵守法律，不知道会发生什么。<br><br>一些人认为，彭斯不应仅仅因为<em>没有违法而</em>获得赞扬。我同情。今天早上我没有抢劫银行——我能得到一块饼干吗？但最终，我发现彭斯在履行职责时表现出的英雄气概令人无法忽视。 1 月 6 日，他面临身体和职业风险；他的事业、他的生活以及他的家人的生命都受到了威胁。他冒着一切风险去遵守法律。很高兴想到我们都会做同样的事情，但我不确定。我<em>确信</em>彭斯的绝大多数共和党同僚不会这么做。<br><br>此外，彭斯是仅有的三名一直直言不讳地谈论 1 月 6 日和法治的共和党总统候选人之一，他并没有将自己对特朗普的批评表述为仅仅是“不利于共和党获胜的机会”。彭斯具备民主运动所希望的共和党人的大部分特质。在某些方面，他是<em>小</em>民主意义上的一个例子，说明了一个旨在恢复健康和自由主义的共和党应该是什么样子。<br><br>也正是因为如此，彭斯才被那么多共和党人谩骂，<a data-event-element="inline link"

class="smallcaps">事实证明</span>，彭斯也不太知道自己该怎么办。因此，他正在尝试成为那些想绞死他的选民的化身。<br><br>这是最该死的事情。彭斯克服了一生的政治部落主义，与他的团队决裂。现在他正试图报复——因为他看不到他帮助他们变成了什么样子。<br><br>我最喜欢的理论之一是，在特朗普执政期间，我们发现我们的政治光谱有两个轴。我们都熟悉左-右、进步-保守的 x 轴。但也有一个从上到下、自由主义到非自由主义的 Y 轴。这种情况在美国已经存在了很长一段时间——实际上是自建国以来——但随着种族隔离制度的结束，我们很多人都忘记了这条 y 轴的存在。我们假设 x 轴右侧的保守派——里根家族、布什家族、多尔家族、麦凯恩家族、罗姆尼家族——也都位于 y 轴的顶部（自由主义一端） 。因为他们是。<br><br>但随着特朗普的出现，一些人——包括选民和民选官员——开始沿着 Y 轴向下飘向非自由主义一边。<br><br>彭斯很乐意配合，直到筹码落下，此时他选择了自由主义和民主。为此，美国欠他一笔永远无法偿还的债。<br><br>彭斯的悲剧在于，尽管他在 x 轴上持有保守主义政策观点，但他对 y 轴上的自由主义的坚定信念现在对他要求投票给他的保守派来说最重要。<br><br>自由社会可以对税率、基础设施支出和外交政策产生争论。在一个不自由的社会中，这些问题都不重要——唯一重要的是谁掌握权力。 “谁，谁？”正如列宁主义者过去所说的那样。<br><br>在民主、宪法、法治等重大问题上，迈克·彭斯现在在 Y 轴上与乔·拜登的距离比与共和党选民的距离要近得多。<br><br>他要么看不到，要么不会。<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:30:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false">

data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w13071/w13071.pdf">2007 年的一项研究</a>中，格莱泽发现，在 20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代，南方的住房供应量比该国其他地区增加了 20%。<br><br>事实上，许多人似乎最终选择了南方，因为他们的目标是加州的完美气候，但很快意识到他们负担不起，并定居在一个同样温暖、更便宜的地方，比如菲尼克斯或奥斯汀。只要问问<a data-event-element="inline link"

<b>“营商友好”环境</b><br><br>并非所有热门、经济实惠的地方都是一样的。奥斯汀成为了一个因流行病而繁荣的城镇，但同样温暖、甚至更便宜的德克萨斯州西部城市米德兰却没有。这就是经济增长、人力资本和某种不可说的雅皮士的复杂组合。<i> </i>参加进来。<br><br>飙升的阳光地带城市大多位于税收较低的州，这有助于吸引企业。但许多国家也拥有著名大学，培养受过高等教育的人才。他们成功地创造了许多类似类型公司紧密相连的“集聚经济”。奥斯汀拥有德克萨斯大学、 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/11/apple-expands-in-austin/">苹果公司校园</a>，以及大批逃离高房价的向上流动的加州人和纽约人。米德兰，嗯，没有。<br><br>早在 20 世纪 70 年代和 80 年代，奥斯汀就开始了吸引科技人才的战略，当时德克萨斯大学商学院院长<a

2018 年调查数据显示，人们搬到佛罗里达的首要原因是离家人更近（37%）、开始新工作（22%） ，<i>然后</i>是气候或天气（14%）。 <a data-event-element="inline link"

Glaeser 表示：“没有任何变量比 1 月份的气温更能预测过去 120 年大都市区的增长。” “每个人都喜欢在冬天打高尔夫球，”加州大学伯克利分校的经济学家恩里科·莫雷蒂说。 “人们真的不喜欢寒冷的冬天，”布鲁金斯学会高级研究员珍妮·舒茨说。人们可能并不总是承认这一点，但他们似乎喜欢温暖的天气。<br><br>温暖的冬天似乎促进了廉价住房和充足的就业机会。人们会模糊地考虑一个有很多新企业和价值 30 万美元房屋的地方，但一旦他们看到数百条 Instagram 帖子，二月的天气是 70 度，他们就会给搬家公司打电话。 “我认为这是口耳相传。这是Instagram。多伦多大学教授（兼 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/richard-florida/"><i>《大西洋</i>月刊》撰稿人</a>）理查德·佛罗里达 (Richard Florida) 表示：“一个地方很热闹。” “‘我的朋友们都在那里。好有趣。他们去餐馆；他们要去海滩；冬天看起来并不冷。”如果你可以远程工作，为什么不呢？<br><br>吸引工人到气候温暖的州的商会、房地产经纪人和行业往往会强调“冬天的高尔夫”元素，淡化“熔岩炎热的七月”。纽约大学教授安德鲁·罗斯（Andrew Ross）撰写了多本有关阳光地带城市的书籍，他表示，“一月、二月和三月是人们被阳光地带吸引的三个原因”。 “房地产开发商、房地产经纪人，他们不谈论夏天。他们谈论一月、二月和三月。”<br><br><b>太阳带的转折点？</b><br><br>也就是说，如果他们的城市继续供暖并且也超出了负担能力的范围，那么所有这些新的亚利桑那州人和德克萨斯人可能会离开。例如，已经有大批人离开<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/miami-sees-its-first-population-drop-in-decades-e181171f">迈阿密</a>。一些阳光地带州的保守派州长可能不会吸引那些被城市吸引的富有创造力的自由派人士。 “假设你是一位搬到迈阿密的同性恋设计师。现在你抬头就会看到罗恩·德桑蒂斯，”理查德·佛罗里达说。 “然后你就说，<i>我他妈在这里做什么？</i> ”<br><br><a href="http://v/">阅读：南方的夏天变得难以忍受</a><br><br>佛罗里达州认为，出于气候和负担能力的原因，下一次大迁徙将是北方。麦迪逊或匹兹堡等中西部城镇可以在没有炎热夏季的情况下提供良好的设施，准备提供阳光地带的替代方案。中西部地区目前拥有<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://wispolicyforum.org/research/worker-incentives-gaining-popularity-in-midwest-but-still-rare-in-wisconsin/">最多的</a>工人搬迁激励计划，该计划向远程工人支付报酬，让他们搬到人口稀少的城市。 （仅印第安纳州就有 16 个。）或者人们可能会迁移到温暖州的稍微凉爽的地区，选择弗拉格斯塔夫而不是凤凰城。 （在某种程度上，这<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.frbsf.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/wp2023-17.pdf">已经发生了</a>。）<br><br>但就目前而言，气候学家的可怕预测似乎并没有让人们感到困惑。当然，德克萨斯人更希望天气凉爽，但炎热显然只是在可以忍受的范围内。菲尼克斯和达拉斯的许多居民在夏天的时候都在有空调的房屋、空调汽车和有空调的办公室之间轮换，以最大限度地减少三位数高温的影响。 “人们越来越多地迁往气候风险地区，而远离风险较低的地区，这一事实表明，要么气候风险不是推动这一趋势的主要因素，要么是住房成本等其他因素正在影响这一趋势。不仅仅是气候风险，”舒茨说。 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.redfin.com/news/redfin-users-interact-with-flood-risk-data/">Redfin 的一项研究</a>表明，对洪水风险的了解可以促使人们购买风险较低的房屋，但目前尚不清楚这是否适用于更广泛的气候风险，例如高温。如果一个县 100% 的地区都有高热风险，那么“更安全”的房子是什么？<br><br>将搬到阳光地带的人们视为非理性或无知是不公平的。我们都希望在一个足够温暖的城市拥有一套便宜的房子和一份好工作。但生活总是需要妥协。加州没有足够的房子。 <a data-event-element="inline link"

运动大会迅速而残酷地被摧毁。在几个小时内，五所成员大学出发参加竞争对手的会议，提供由电视体育合同资助的巨额发薪日。正如杰梅勒·希尔（Jemele Hill）在<i>《大西洋月刊》</i>上<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/college-football-greed-conference-alignment/674930/">所说的那样</a>，这种转变“使学校和会议的长期利益与他们自己永不满足的贪婪发生了冲突”。<br><br>体育爱好者习惯于看到他们最喜欢的球队把钱放在球迷的愿望之上。这让人很容易忘记，这不是一个关于职业体育特许经营权的故事，或者实际上，任何类型的私人实体的故事。所有五所叛逃学校都是公立大学：华盛顿州、俄勒冈州、犹他州、亚利桑那州和亚利桑那州立大学。大学橄榄球赛的抢钱行为只是美国公立高等教育面临的令人不安的压力的一个症状。事实证明，我们的许多公立大学的行为根本不像公共机构。<br><br>人们很自然地认为公立高等教育机构比私立高等教育机构更加平等。在 K-12 中，公立学校免费，而私立学校则昂贵。但在大学层面，公民目的和私人利润之间的界限并没有那么清晰地映射到公共/私人鸿沟上。迄今为止最清晰的证据来自哈佛大学机会洞察项目的三位经济学家最近进行的一项<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://opportunityinsights.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/CollegeAdmissions_Paper.pdf">轰动一时的研究</a>。大多数媒体报道都集中在该研究对所谓的常春藤+学校的分析上，研究人员发现，与其他具有相同学术背景的申请者相比，最富有的学生的录取率更高。即使在 SAT 成绩相同的人群中，来自收入最高 0.1% 的学生进入哈佛大学、普林斯顿大学和耶鲁大学等大学的可能性也是普通学生的两倍多。加州大学伯克利分校和弗吉尼亚大学等公立旗舰大学没有表现出这种偏见。<br><br><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/08/public-universities-debt/619546/">乔什·米切尔：债务的深红色浪潮</a><br><br>但研究人员不仅仅研究主导公共话语的精英大学小集团。他们的样本包括 139 所机构，其中包括 50 所公立大学，结果显示出更为复杂的情况。并非所有私立学校都偏向富人，而且一些最过分迎合富人需求的学校实际上是公立学校。<br><br>就像我们这个分裂的大国生活的许多方面一样，当地大学的特征在很大程度上取决于您居住的地方。纽约州和加利福尼亚州等蓝色大国拥有广泛且备受推崇的大学系统，在招生方面没有财富偏见。如果有的话，他们的情况恰恰相反。超级富豪进入伯克利大学的可能性比同等资格的非富豪学生<i>低</i>近 50%。这一趋势适用于整个加州大学系统以及纽约州立大学的校园。尽管全国范围内的公立大学预算因经济大衰退而遭受重创，但加州和纽约最终<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://shef.sheeo.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/SHEEO_SHEF_FY22_Report.pdf">恢复了</a>损失的资金并投入了更多资金。这为他们提供了保持低学费的资源，并减少了追逐富有申请者的动力。这些系统的庞大规模也意味着权力和金钱不会集中在一所渴望获得伟大体育成就的旗舰大学中。纽约州立大学石溪分校和加州大学圣塔芭芭拉分校都是一流的研究型大学，但没有人花大价钱购买石溪海狼队或加州大学圣塔芭芭拉分校高乔队橄榄球比赛的转播权；后一个团队甚至不存在。这些校园周围没有丰富的体育助推器、传统招生和地区贵族的根深蒂固的文化。<br><br>其他州的情况有所不同，尤其是南方。从统计数据来看，奥本大学、密西西比大学、阿肯色大学和阿拉巴马大学等公立大学在财富和招生方面与常春藤盟校非常相似。这些学校的选择性并不严格——大多数申请者都会被录取——因此排除机制与普林斯顿大学或耶鲁大学不同。为了衡量这一点，机会洞察研究人员不仅关注录取率，还关注申请人是否有可能申请和参加，这种方法涵盖了营销、招聘、录取、定价和入学的整个过程。他们的研究结果表明，一所大学不需要超级精英来维持阶级分化。南方的一些公立大学与东北部的私立学院和大学具有相同的功能：政治领导人和富商子女的目的地，以及将这种地位传递给下一代的机制。尽管阿拉巴马州是美国贫困率最高的州之一，但只有 11% 的奥本学生有资格获得联邦佩尔助学金。阿拉巴马州超过<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.alabamapublichealth.gov/healthstats/assets/83t2019.pdf">30%</a>的大学生居民是黑人，但黑人学生在奥本学生总数中所占<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://auburn.edu/administration/ir/factbook/enrollment-demographics/historical-summaries/enrollment-gender-ethnicity.html">比例不到 5%</a> 。<br><br>因此，如果你想知道南方的公立大学学生如何负担得起<a

Alabama both told me that they work hard to recruit and provide financial aid to low-income students in their respective states, which is true. Both say that income is not one of the official criteria that their admissions officers consider. But it doesn&#39;t have to be, because a very efficient unofficial filter is at play. Most of the students attending schools like the universities of Arkansas and Alabama come from other places, meaning they pay out-of-state tuition. At Alabama, where 58 percent of undergrads come from elsewhere, that amounts to $32,400 a year, plus room and board. Students who can afford such a high sticker price are wealthy almost by definition, and they are vital to public-university finances. The University of Michigan <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://admissions.umich.edu/costs-aid/costs">charges</a> out-of-state students more than $55,000, the same price as Harvard. Administrators are essentially running two institutions in parallel: a reasonably affordable public university for the residents of Michigan (in-state tuition: $16,736), and a very expensive private university for everyone else.<br><br> This dual identity shows up in the Harvard-study results. The richest and poorest students from Michigan get into Michigan at similar rates, controlling for test scores. For out-of-state students, however, there&#39;s a marked lean toward the rich. Again, this works differently than it does at elite private universities. In the Ivy Plus schools, the pro-wealth bias is accomplished with a witches&#39; brew of legacy preferences, admissions bumps for <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2018/10/college-sports-benefits-white-students/573688/">patrician sports</a> such as squash and sailing, and outright <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-story-behind-jared-kushners-curious-acceptance-into-harvard">pay-to-play arrangements</a> for mega-donors. At public universities, it&#39;s a more straightforward downstream effect of pricing. Most out-of-state students get little or no financial aid, so only the rich can afford to enroll.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Universities defend these policies</span> by arguing that wealthy students subsidize their poorer classmates, who don&#39;t pay full price. But as the sociologists Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton describe in their groundbreaking 2015 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/paying-for-the-party-how-college-maintains-inequality-elizabeth-a-armstrong/9780674088023?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Paying for the Party</i></a> <i>,</i> the two-tier approach works out badly for first-generation and low-income students. Following two groups of undergraduates at Indiana University, they found that the wealthy out-of-staters sailed through four years of fraternity parties and weekend tailgates to graduate, marry, and start careers, while the first-gen students ended up with burdensome student loans, uncertain job prospects, and no degrees.<br><br> For some low-income students, the dream of attending a flagship public university turns sour. At Alabama, there&#39;s an 18-percentage-point <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=university+of+alabama&amp;s=all&amp;id=100751#outcome">gap</a> between the graduation rate of Pell-grant students and their more well-off peers, an unusually large disparity. Despite all of those out-of-state dollars, families earning less than $75,000 still pay <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?q=university+of+alabama&amp;s=all&amp;id=100751#expenses">about</a> $20,000 a year in total costs to attend. Auburn&#39;s numbers are similarly grim. The more public universities come to resemble private ones, the more they cater to the people who pay the bills. Consider the three mega-conferences that now dominate the college-football landscape, the SEC, Big 10, and Big 12. Michigan State, University of Florida, Purdue, University of Kentucky, Texas A&amp;M: all big-time sports schools, all running the out-of-state full-tuition racket, all skewed toward the rich.<br><br> The gap between public universities that combat wealth inequality and those that seem to perpetuate it maps onto the red/blue divide, but only roughly. Higher education in America is also shaped by idiosyncrasies of history and geography. North Carolina, a purplish state, has a great, well-funded system of affordable public universities. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill has no wealth preferences, nor does North Carolina State. (Duke University, right nearby, has that covered.) Pennsylvania, a fairly blue state, has an unusually lousy tradition of inadequate funding for public universities. Penn State charges non-Pennsylvanians $38,000 a year.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/07/raj-chetty-paper-harvard-ivy-league-elite/674803/">Annie Lowrey: Why you have to care about these 12 colleges</a><br><br> One kind of university seems immune to all of these trends: science-and-engineering schools. Based on my analysis of the data, only five private universities in the Harvard study were <i>less</i> likely to admit applicants from the top 0.1 percent than comparably qualified middle-class students. Four of them—California Institute of Technology, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Worcester Polytechnic University, and Case Western Reserve University—have top-class engineering programs. Among the Ivy Pluses, MIT was the least corrupted by wealth preferences. Public universities such as the Georgia Institute of Technology, Virginia Tech, and the Colorado School of Mines also had more egalitarian results.<br><br> Even the most elite liberal-arts school can create an easy glide path to graduation for the dull-witted progeny of a deep-pocketed alum. Athletic recruits can famously go from start to finish at a big state school without encountering a single challenging idea along the way. Engineering schools, by contrast, have academic standards that are harder to evade. Martin Schmidt, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic, came to the job after serving as provost at MIT. “There&#39;s a phrase we used there,” he told me, about the rigorous math and science classes all students are required to take. “&#39;There&#39;s nowhere to hide.&#39;”<br><br> Of course, not every university can or should be devoted to math and science. But the existence of these respected engineering institutions—public and private, humble and world-renowned—shows that there&#39;s nothing inevitable about higher-education systems that bend toward the gravity of wealth. If academic standards come first, the power of money recedes. Otherwise, colleges and universities become just one more thing to be bought and sold.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/public-university-wealthy-admissions/675009/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/public-university-wealthy-admissions/675009/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Man Who Transformed American Theater]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> How August Wilson became one of the country&#39;s most influential playwrights <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/vOmQZVfMA7Apu0F_IUVdQA_Gyrs=/0x0:2000x1125/960x540/media/img/2023/07/AugustWilson/original.png" alt="A black-and-white photo August Wilson in a trench coat, driving cap, and tie sitting on sofa and gesturing in conversation with a brick wall behind" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Associated Press</figcaption></figure> W <span class="smallcaps">hen August Wilson&#39;s</span> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-piano-lesson-august-wilson/9780452265349?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Piano Lesson</i></a> opened at the Huntington Theatre in Boston in 1988, my mother, her friend Renée, and I sat in the audience, captivated by the struggles of a brother and sister at odds about the fate of a family heirloom, a piano on which their enslaved ancestor had made African carvings. The vernacular dialogue, the ghosts, and the humor—as a teenager a couple of years earlier, I&#39;d been stunned by a similar mix in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/joe-turner-s-come-and-gone-a-play-in-two-acts-august-wilson/9780452260092?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Joe Turner&#39;s Come and Gone</i></a> at the same theater (and had spotted Wilson pacing in the lobby). Still, the new play felt unlike anything we&#39;d ever seen. After the performance, we headed to Slade&#39;s, a historic restaurant and bar (once owned by the Celtics legend Bill Russell) in the predominantly Black enclave of Roxbury. The lights were low and the music was loud, and I might not have noticed the cast members in the crowd if they hadn&#39;t just held me in thrall for three hours. I didn&#39;t see Wilson at Slade&#39;s that night, but if he was there, I imagine he was in a corner spinning “big lies,” a Black English term for storytelling banter. I remember thinking that of course these actors would find their way to a joint in the hood. Slade&#39;s could easily have been described in Wilson&#39;s stage directions as a location for some postshow unwinding.<br><br> Critics consider the 1980s and &#39;90s a renaissance of African American cultural production. In literature, Black women—Alice Walker, Toni Morrison, Paule Marshall, and others—took their place among the most important writers in American history. Many of the stories they told resurrected the lives of earlier generations of women who had been largely neglected in art and society. Hip-hop, an insurgent art form with roots in postindustrial cities in the aftermath of the civil-rights movement, was thriving. Mainly male, with some notable exceptions, its creators and performers were brash and defiant—and enjoying a golden age of creativity, achieving feats of lyrical dexterity and figurative language. Critics were hailing hip-hop as a form of popular literature, akin to the blues in the early 20th century.<br><br> August Wilson, born in 1945 and raised in Pittsburgh&#39;s Hill District, is best known for his 10-play cycle evoking 20th-century Black life, set almost entirely in that city. His work—which, taken together, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2001/04/16/august-wilson-been-here-and-gone">tells the story</a> of Jim Crow, incarceration, migration, and the civil-rights era, conveying the beauty and pathos, the resilience and heartbreak of Black people—did not fit neatly into either the literary or the musical renaissance. His art reflected a blend, and his <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/t-magazine/august-wilson-ma-rainey.html">impact on American theater</a> , which has extended well beyond <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2005/10/03/theater/newsandfeatures/august-wilson-theaters-poet-of-black-america-is-dead-at-60.html">his death, in 2005</a> , is related to both.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/12/two-new-films-honor-august-wilsons-rebellion/617456/">Read: The unconscious rebellion of August Wilson</a><br><br> The critic Patti Hartigan&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/august-wilson-a-life-patti-hartigan/9781501180668?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>August Wilson: A Life</i></a> traces the larger context of his achievement as thoroughly as it does his distinctive vision. Wilson embarked on playwriting during the Black Arts movement of 1965–75, when poetic performance art emerged as a signature form of expression, an important precursor to hip-hop. He joined in the vision of community-based art espoused by Amiri Baraka, Hoyt Fuller, and others. Baraka&#39;s dramatic work stirred his interest in mythic symbolism, and in theater and its power. Wilson&#39;s own poetry, though, was mocked for its lack of revolutionary rage, and he felt on the periphery of the movement. Like many of the women novelists, he was interested in the interior lives of earlier generations that had withstood the humiliations of slavery and Jim Crow, and sustained themselves with folk traditions and spirituality. His plays were woven of Black language and songs (sometimes drawing, as with “Old Dog Blue” in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/fences-august-wilson/9780452264014?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Fences</i></a> , on stories and characters from songs), and they invoked Black rituals of worship and the rhythms of labor too. Wilson&#39;s vision conjoined hoodoo and history in completely singular ways. Against the odds, he arrived at the apex of American theater.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Frederick August</span> <span class="smallcaps">Kittel Jr.</span> , Wilson&#39;s given name, was the fourth child born to Daisy Wilson, who had migrated to Pittsburgh from North Carolina in 1937. His father was largely absent from the family&#39;s life and provided little in the way of financial support. Frederick Kittel, a German immigrant, was already married to a Polish woman, and his relationship with Daisy, 24 years younger, was “tempestuous,” Hartigan writes. A struggling single mother, Daisy took particular pride in Freddy, who was an early and avid reader. He was also an excellent student—and something of a loner, a boy with a stutter (and, when provoked, a temper). When he earned a place at the elite and predominantly white Central Catholic High School, Daisy became even more invested in his future greatness. But after growing up in what Hartigan calls the “melting pot” of the Hill District, he was routinely harassed with racist slurs and threats, and he left just before turning 15. He went back to public school (briefly a vocational one), where he didn&#39;t last long either. A 10th-grade teacher accused him of plagiarizing a paper on Napoleon—20 typed pages, with footnotes that reflected his deep curiosity and wide reading. That was the end of his high-school experience.<br><br> Wilson was steeped in the Western canon and romantic themes, and also a man of his neighborhood.<br><br> Wilson would later say, “I dropped out of school, but I did not drop out of life.” He read his way through a nearby library. When his mother learned that he&#39;d left school, she accused him of squandering his abundant gifts, and insisted that he enlist in the Army. Wilson quit a year in, and after a short detour to Los Angeles, was back in Pittsburgh, now borrowing books from the University of Pittsburgh library (Freud, history, poetry), mingling with local characters in cafés, and imagining a life as a writer. Hartigan&#39;s descriptions of his idiosyncratic, youthful self-creation are a delight. He was wonderfully strange, and that was at least one key to his becoming the sui generis playwright he was:<br><br> He worked odd jobs, and he adopted a sartorial style that was more akin to the 1940s than the turbulent 1960s. He bought woolen coats from the St. Vincent de Paul thrift shop, and he always had his shoes shined … He would walk down the street reciting poetry to himself, and more often than not, he had an armful of books … He was cultivating an image of a romantic poet. Hartigan emphasizes at several points that Wilson identified not as mixed race, but rather as a Black man raised by a Black woman migrant from the South. Given when he was born, this detail isn&#39;t particularly notable. Generations of Black people were fathered by absent white men. For Wilson, though, making the break official was an important turning point; he began going by August with new friends, and he spent the day of his father&#39;s funeral, in April 1965, deciding how to rechristen himself. He dropped Kittel&#39;s first and last name and took his mother&#39;s surname. August Wilson was born.<br><br> Wilson&#39;s self-fashioning wasn&#39;t smooth. Navigating the social and political turmoil of the &#39;60s and &#39;70s, he was “straddling two worlds,” in Hartigan&#39;s phrase, as he searched for his voice. He was steeped in the Western canon and romantic themes, a poet inclined to grandiloquence, and also a man of his neighborhood. Meanwhile, he had married in 1969. Soon he was tugged away from his wife, Brenda Burton, and their baby daughter by his growing involvement in local artistic collectives that had emerged from the ferment of the Black Power movement: Black Horizons Theatre and the Centre Avenue Poets&#39; Theater Workshop. His divorce in 1973 devastated him (though he went on to have two more wives and another daughter, and was known for his “serial infidelity,” Hartigan writes). Black Horizons Theatre folded. His first effort at playwriting, in essence a dialogue between a male character given to high-flown rhetoric and a plainspoken woman, was a flop. By the mid-&#39;70s, he had weathered what looked like a run of failures.<br><br> In 1978, Wilson headed to St. Paul, Minnesota, to work with the Penumbra Theatre Company, at the invitation of a Pittsburgh friend and fellow director. He&#39;d been working on poems and a play about a Black outlaw figure, which that same friend and others were eager to help him turn into a musical. It did finally get staged in St. Paul, and tanked. His focus on playwriting intensified as he swerved away from the “Americanized Homeric dialogue” that critics had derided. By that time, he had taken up the blues as inspiration—music that he described as having the power to conjure “blood&#39;s memory.”<br><br> The newly vernacular Wilson, with the help of his soon-to-be second wife, Judy Oliver, began applying for grants and fellowships (largely in vain). But in 1981, he submitted a long play he was working on, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/ma-rainey-s-black-bottom-a-play-august-wilson/9780452261136?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Ma Rainey&#39;s Black Bottom</i></a> , and was at last awarded a spot at the annual summer conference at the Eugene O&#39;Neill Theater Center, in Waterford, Connecticut, known as the “launchpad of the American theater.” Wilson, and American theater along with him, was indeed about to take off in a new direction.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">At the</span> <span class="smallcaps">O&#39;Neill</span> , he met Lloyd Richards, the Black director who had brought Lorraine Hansberry to Broadway in 1959 and served as the dean of the Yale School of Drama and the artistic director of the Yale Repertory Theatre. Richards presided over the workshop, and, as the other playwrights gathered there in 1982 sensed right away, Wilson was his favorite. The legendary mentor, eager to discover theater&#39;s “Great Black Hope,” spotted a distinctive talent in the early version of <i>Ma Rainey</i> , despite its long monologues and sprawl. Wilson&#39;s play, about a 1927 recording session of the Mother of the Blues and her band, exposes the ordeals of Jim Crow, sexual violence, exploitation, and cruelty—and the meaning of the blues, an art of lamentation as well as pleasure. Hartigan reports that Wilson&#39;s star rose even higher when Frank Rich of <i>The New York Times</i> violated the O&#39;Neill conference&#39;s press protocol (only soft features allowed, no reviews) and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1982/08/01/theater/stage-view-where-writers-mold-the-future-of-theater.html">singled out his play for a rave</a> . “I was electrified by the sound of this author&#39;s voice,” Rich wrote, declaring it “quite unusual in 1982 to find a playwright who is willing to stake his claim to the stage not with stories or moral platitudes, but with the beauty and meaning of torrents of words.” Two years later, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://issuu.com/yalerep/docs/yrtmarainey_s1984?fr=sNTY1ODE5MzE2OTA"><i>Ma Rainey</i> opened to acclaim at the Yale Rep</a> in the spring, and then on Broadway in the fall.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2020/12/ma-raineys-black-bottom-netflix/617445/">Read: <em>Ma Rainey&#39;s Black Bottom</em> and the liberating power of music</a><br><br> A long collaborative relationship with Richards had begun. Wilson was protective of his prose and pacing, and exacting with performers—yet also receptive to suggestion, above all from Richards. Twenty-six years older than Wilson, he was the sage, a father figure ready with guidance well tuned to his protégé. That meant helping Wilson find “a through line or a fully realized theme,” as Richards put it, to give coherence to the fascinating characters and the often disjointed scenes and speeches that first propelled Wilson into a play. It also meant encouraging Wilson&#39;s extraordinary gift for potent monologues, evocative symbolism, and scenes of supernatural struggle—hardly familiar fare for mainstream theatergoers.<br><br> Not least, Richards took on the challenge of attracting a producer. “Serious plays concerning minorities … are not considered a good risk,” he observed, never mind one like <i>Joe Turner</i> , whose first act is capped by an African juba scene—call-and-response building to a “near frenzy,” as Wilson wrote in the stage directions. Together, Richards and Wilson came up with an unusual strategy, and in the process helped inaugurate a new and closer relationship between commercial and nonprofit theater in America. Work was first staged in regional theaters, which were free of Broadway&#39;s commercial pressures and able to take chances, and Wilson got the kind of “long development process” he knew he needed, revising tirelessly in rehearsals and in reaction to performances. Plays could then tour the country before Broadway runs, Wilson often hovering and still revising. The Black playwright who wants to depict working-class Black life depends on a public comprising tourists and elites, and on critics—an audience very far afield from such a life. That Wilson and Richards found a way to negotiate the terrain and still produce great art is extraordinary.<br><br> Facilitating the emergence of Black artists working at the highest level was yet another way Wilson transformed Black theater.<br><br> By the end of the 1980s, even Wilson&#39;s demanding mother (who died in 1983) might have admitted that he had outstripped her expectations. But Hartigan&#39;s account doesn&#39;t hide the frustrations he felt as he juggled multiple plays at once and the toll his labors took on others. Wilson&#39;s most conventionally structured play, the 1987 Pulitzer Prize–winning <i>Fences</i> , about a tragic father-son struggle and the wounds of Jim Crow, was the most financially successful of his life. It was also, he said, his “least favorite.” Hartigan writes that he “knew he had strayed from his spiritual and poetic muse in writing a play to please audiences—and to prove himself to his critics and colleagues.”<br><br> <i>Joe Turner&#39;s Come and Gone</i> and <i>The Piano Lesson</i> , both experimental and infused with supernatural hauntings, were his masterpieces. The former—inspired, Wilson wrote, by a man “sitting in this posture of abject defeat” in the center of a Romare Bearden collage—addresses the horrific history of convict-labor leasing and is threaded with references to losing one&#39;s “song,” an opaque yet resonant image for being robbed of one&#39;s spiritual groundedness. When <i>The Piano Lesson</i> earned him a second Pulitzer, in 1990, and then was filmed for television, to be aired in 1995, Wilson was at the center of the theater world. But his relationship with Richards was deteriorating in classic patricidal fashion: As Wilson grew comfortable in his prominence, he chafed at Richards&#39;s guiding role.<br><br> Wilson in turn found himself under attack, most scathingly by Robert Brustein, the founder of the American Repertory Theater at Harvard and <i>The New Republic</i> ’s theater critic. He dismissed <i>The Piano Lesson</i> as “much ado about a piano,” and denigrated Wilson&#39;s success as a turn toward the “sociological” and away from artistic value. Pointing to his characters who “sit on the edge of the middle class, wearing good suits, inhabiting clean homes,” and who “never come on like menacing street people screaming obscenities or bombarding the audience with such phrases as &#39;Black power&#39;s gonna get your mama,&#39; ” Brustein implied that Wilson&#39;s work in general was calibrated to elicit white guilt without jeopardizing white acceptance. Any Black artist who has acquired a modicum of mainstream acclaim while sustaining a sincere interest in Black life knows this kind of criticism intimately. Wilson&#39;s experience is an aching reminder that no amount of professional stature insulates one from it. In fact, quite the contrary.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2021/06/richard-wright-man-who-lived-underground/618705/">From the June 2021 issue: Imani Perry on the bleak prescience of Richard Wright</a><br><br> Wilson&#39;s second marriage ended in 1990; “I was never there for her,” he said, pulled away constantly by work. In 1997, he was thrilled by the birth of another daughter, with his third wife, Constanza Romero, but was busier than ever, feeling stymied in efforts to support Black theater and facing three more plays to finish his cycle. Once again, he was often disengaged from family life, despite the shame he felt—and pressure from a strong-willed wife: yet another case of male artistic genius accommodated. Wilson was, though, rightly criticized for his failure to paint his women characters with the same depth as the men. Even <i>Ma Rainey&#39;s Black Bottom</i> is less about Ma Rainey than about her bandmate Levee, who witnessed white men gang-raping his mother when he was a child, a wound that tragically shapes his adult life.<br><br> Wilson&#39;s relationship to the world of Black theater was nurturing, even if distance opened up between him and some early friends in the arts scene as he became by far the most influential Black man in American theater. Many prominent stage and film actors of the late 20th century worked with Wilson at some point. His plays gave Charles S. Dutton, Viola Davis, Rocky Carroll, Angela Bassett, Ruben Santiago-Hudson, and others roles that were rare for Black actors, ones in which they could show their range and power. Facilitating the emergence of Black artists working at the highest level was yet another way Wilson transformed Black theater.<br><br> His century cycle turned out to be more than an utterly distinctive African American history in theatrical form. Wilson&#39;s endeavor, like his anomalous route into playwriting, marked out new paths in the theater world and reflected a vital aesthetic: With every play, he was viscerally aware that the essence of dramatic art is found in the living, breathing doing of it with a collective cast of participants—actors, directors, producers, mentors, audiences. Reworking isn&#39;t failure. Indeed, Wilson the bluesman rewrote and remixed in real time, improvising and experimenting his way to mastery and historical revelation.<br><br> <small><i>This article appears in the</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09"><i>September 2023</i></a> <i>print edition with the headline “The Man Who Transformed American Theater.”</i></small><br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Tue, 15 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/august-wilson-plays-patti-hartigan-book/674770/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2023/09/august-wilson-plays-patti-hartigan-book/674770/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[The Georgia Indictment Offers the Whole Picture]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> Fani Willis filed charges against Donald Trump and 18 others, alleging a sweeping scheme to overturn the 2020 election. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ylCMLnbSHgvlha1yQZ43s_A_hbA=/0x0:4800x2700/960x540/media/img/mt/2023/08/trump_georgia/original.jpg" alt="刘易斯·P·斯莱顿法院" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption> Elijah Nouvelage / AFP / Getty</figcaption></figure> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">, Monday through Friday.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small><br><br> If justice is blind, she sometimes heads down unpredictable paths.

Graham: A brazen, dead-serious attack on American democracy</a><br><br> Willis takes a very different approach, with 41 counts against the 19 defendants. Crucially, the charges are brought under Georgia&#39;s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. That&#39;s a favorite of the prosecutor—“I&#39;m a fan of RICO,” she <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/why-georgias-rico-law-could-be-key-in-the-states-case-against-trump">said in a news conference</a> about a gang-related case last year—and it allows her to charge a large number of people with a concerted effort toward a goal, even if not all members of the group committed all of the crimes involved.<br><br> The indictment charges that Trump, the 18 co-defendants, and 30 other unindicted co-conspirators “constituted a criminal organization whose members and associates engaged in various related criminal activities including, but not limited to, false statements and writings, impersonating a public officer, forgery, filing false documents, influencing witnesses, computer theft, computer trespass, computer invasion of privacy, conspiracy to defraud the state, acts involving theft, and perjury.”<br><br> This indictment is not a gripping read, stretching over 80-some pages and collecting 161 separate alleged overt acts in furtherance of the conspiracy. But in its comprehensive scope, it gives a fuller picture of Trump&#39;s attack on American democracy than any other indictment so far. In many ways, it echoes the report put together by the House committee on January 6 that completed its work earlier this year, just before Republicans took over the majority.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/criminal-justice-system-and-election-are-not-going-get-along/673971/">David A. Graham: The criminal-justice system and the election are not going to get along</a><br><br> The elements of the conspiracy include crimes specific to Georgia: a breach of voting machines in Coffee County; an attempt to intimidate Ruby Freeman, an election worker in Fulton County; lies told to Georgia officials and attempts to enlist them in the election subversion; the creation of false slates of electors to be submitted to the Electoral College.<br><br> But the indictment also sweeps up crimes committed by the defendants elsewhere, including similar efforts at the state level in Arizona and Pennsylvania, an attempt to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/jeffrey-clark-doj-weaponization-trump-indictment/674898/">leverage the Justice Department</a> to help justify subversion schemes, and a ploy to get then–Vice President Mike Pence to throw a wrench in the January 6, 2021, certification of the election.<br><br> It is remarkable, and a bit troubling, to see a local official like Willis—even one in a huge county like Fulton—bringing charges of this scope. On the one hand, common sense says that the <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/trumps-coup-before-january-6/620998/">paperwork coup</a> , whether or not it was criminal, was clearly a connected whole and not a series of isolated actions, and so it makes sense to treat it as such in court. Smith&#39;s August indictment is an odd document, hitting some elements hard while ignoring others.<br><br> On the other hand, an attempt to undermine the presidential election on a national scale is clearly a matter larger than any county prosecutor&#39;s purview. A nation in which local district attorneys feel empowered to charge presidents, current or former, is a potentially chaotic one. (What&#39;s to stop conservative prosecutors in small counties from bringing flimsy charges against Joe Biden?)<br><br> Willis has the freedom to bring a much broader case in part <em>because</em> she is a local prosecutor. Though under Merrick Garland, the Justice Department has emphasized its distance from politics, Smith must know how politically incendiary and possibly unworkable an enormous federal RICO indictment would be. Perhaps even more important, he knows that if Trump or another Republican wins the 2024 election, they will likely try to shut down any federal prosecution as soon as they take office—encouraging him to keep his case tightly focused and fast-moving. Willis, an elected official, doesn&#39;t have the same political constraints, and her case isn&#39;t subject to the whims of the federal executive branch.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/donald-trumps-unhinged-attacks-smith-and-chutkan/674945/">David A. Graham: Trump is acting like he&#39;s cornered</a><br><br> But proving such a case will be difficult. RICO cases are famously complicated, unwieldy, and sometimes confounding to jurors, even in less politically charged situations. In a statement last night, Trump argued that his actions as charged under the indictment constitute free speech. “They are taking away President Trump&#39;s First Amendment right to free speech, and the right to challenge a rigged and stolen election that the Democrats do all the time,” he said.<br><br> Trump also complained that the charges have taken too long to bring. Without any evidence, he wrote that Willis had “strategically stalled her investigation to try and maximally interfere with the 2024 presidential race,” adding, “They could have brought this two and half years ago.” Though investigations take time, he&#39;s got a point. Still, underscoring that all Americans were aware of his subversion scheme at the time it was happening is not as exculpatory as Trump might like to pretend.<br><br> Whatever the reasons for the timeline, Willis has speed on her mind now. She said at a press conference after the indictments were released that she wanted to bring all 19 defendants to trial together within the next six months. That would put the case right in the heat of the Republican primary.<br><br> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/criminal-justice-system-and-election-are-not-going-get-along/673971/">As I have written</a> , the criminal-justice and political systems are not just designed to not work well together; they are designed to be separate.

I had arrived a few hours before check-in, hoping to drop off my bags before I met a friend for lunch. The employees were clearly frazzled, overwhelmed by the sudden influx of several hundred impatient academics. When I asked where I could put my luggage, the guy at the front desk simply pointed to a nearby hallway. “Wait over there with her; he&#39;s coming back.”<br><br> Who “he” was remained unclear, but I saw the woman he was referring to. She was white and about my age. She had a conference badge and a large suitcase that she was rolling back and forth in obvious exasperation. “Been waiting long?” I asked, taking up a position on the other side of the narrow hallway. “ <i>Very</i> ,” she replied. For a while, we stood in silence, minding our phones. Eventually, we began chatting.<br><br> The conversation was wide-ranging: the papers we were presenting, the bad A/V at the hotel, our favorite things to do in the city. At some point, we began talking about our jobs. She told me that— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/upshot/academic-job-crisis-phd.html">like so many academics</a> —she was juggling a temporary teaching gig while also looking for a tenure-track position.<br><br> “It&#39;s hard,” she said, “too many classes, too many students, too many papers to grade. No time for your own work. Barely any time to apply to <i>real</i> jobs.”<br><br> When I nodded sympathetically, she asked about my job and whether it was tenure-track. I admitted, a little sheepishly, that it was.<br><br> “I&#39;d love to teach at a small college like that,” she said. “I feel like none of my students wants to learn. It&#39;s exhausting.”<br><br> Then, out of nowhere, she said something that caught me completely off guard: “But I shouldn&#39;t be complaining to you about this. I know <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2020/10/21/scholars-talk-about-being-black-campus-2020">how hard</a> BIPOC faculty have it. You&#39;re the last person I should be whining to.”<br><br> I was taken aback, but I shouldn&#39;t have been. It was the kind of awkward comment I&#39;ve grown used to over the past few years, as “anti-racism” has become the reigning ideology of progressive political culture. Until recently, calling attention to a stranger&#39;s race in such a way would have been considered a social faux pas. That she made the remark without thinking twice—a remark, it should be noted, that assumes being a Black tenure-track professor is <i>worse</i> than being a marginally employed white one—shows how profoundly interracial social etiquette has changed since 2020&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/2020/08/16/902179773/summer-of-racial-reckoning-the-match-lit">“summer of racial reckoning.”</a> That&#39;s when anti-racism—focused on combating “color-blindness” in both policy and personal conduct—grabbed ahold of the liberal mainstream.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/02/tyre-nichols-death-memphis-george-floyd-police-reform/672986/">Wesley Lowery: Why there was no racial reckoning</a><br><br> Though this “reckoning” brought increased public attention to the deep embeddedness of racism in supposedly color-blind American institutions, it also made instant celebrities of a number of race experts and “diversity, equity, and inclusion” (DEI) consultants who believe that being anti-racist means undergoing a<a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gsb-sites.stanford.edu/anti-racism-and-allyship/">“journey”</a> of radical personal transformation. In their righteous crusade against the bad color-blindness of policies such as race-neutral college admissions, these contemporary anti-racists have also jettisoned the kind of <i>good</i> color-blindness that holds that we are more than our race, and that we should conduct our social life according to that idealized principle. Rather than balance a critique of color-blind law and policy with a continuing embrace of interpersonal color-blindness as a social etiquette, contemporary anti-racists throw the baby out with the bathwater. In place of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.thefp.com/p/actually-color-blindness-isnt-racist">the old color-blind ideal</a> , they have foisted upon well-meaning white liberals a successor social etiquette predicated on the necessity of foregrounding racial difference rather than minimizing it.<br><br> As a Black guy who grew up in a politically purple area—where being a good person meant adhering to the kind of civil-rights-era color-blindness that is now passé—I find this emergent anti-racist culture jarring. Many of my liberal friends and acquaintances now seem to believe that being a good person means constantly reminding Black people that you are aware of their Blackness. Difference, no longer to be politely ignored, is insisted upon at all times under the guise of acknowledging “positionality.” Though I am rarely made to feel excessively aware of my race when hanging out with more conservative friends or visiting my hometown, in the more liberal social circles in which I typically travel, my race is constantly invoked—“acknowledged” and “centered”—by well-intentioned anti-racist “allies.”<br><br> This “acknowledgement” tends to take one of two forms. The first is the song and dance in which white people not-so-subtly let <i>you</i> know that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/opinion/not-a-racist.html"><i>they</i> know that race and racism exist</a> . This includes finding ways to interject discussion of some (bad) news item about race or racism into casual conversation, apologizing for having problems while white (“You&#39;re the last person I should be whining to”), or inversely, offering “support” by attributing any normal human problem <i>you</i> have to racism.<br><br> The second way good white liberals often “center” racial difference in everyday interactions with minorities is by trying, always clumsily, to ensure that their “marginalized” friends and familiars are “culturally” comfortable. My favorite personal experiences of this include an acquaintance who invariably steers dinner or lunch meetups to Black-owned restaurants, and the time that a friend of a friend invited me over to go swimming in their pool before apologizing for assuming that I know how to swim (“I know that&#39;s a culturally specific thing”). It is a peculiar quirk of the 2020s&#39; racial discourse that this kind of “acknowledgement” and “centering” is viewed as progress.<br><br> My point is not that conservatives have better racial politics— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/08/07/opinion/florida-board-education-slavery-nazism/">they do not</a> —but rather that something about current progressive racial discourse has become warped and distorted. The anti-racist culture that is ascendant seems to me to have little to do with combatting structural racism or cultivating better relationships between white and Black Americans. And its rejection of color-blindness as a social ethos is not a new frontier of radical political action.<br><br> No, at the core of today&#39;s anti-racism is <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/01/15/black-lives-matter-george-floyd-protests-policy-change/">little more than a vibe shift</a> —a soft matrix of conciliatory gestures and hip phraseology that give adherents the <i>feeling</i> that there has been a cultural change, when in fact we have merely put carpet over the rotting floorboards. Although this push to center rather than sidestep racial difference in our interpersonal relationships comes from a good place, it tends to rest on a troubling, even racist subtext: that white and Black Americans are so radically different that interracial relationships require careful management, constant eggshell-walking, and even expert guidance from professional anti-racists. Rather than producing racial harmony, this new ethos frequently has the opposite effect, making white-Black interactions stressful, unpleasant, or, perhaps most often, simply weird.<br><br> Since the murder of George Floyd in May 2020, progressive anti-racism has centered on two concepts that helped Americans make sense of his senseless death: “structural racism” and “implicit bias.” The first of these is a sociopolitical concept that highlights how certain institutions— <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/02/12/upshot/child-maternal-mortality-rich-poor.html">maternity wards</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/06/16/us/minneapolis-police-george-floyd">police barracks</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://themarkup.org/denied/2021/08/25/the-secret-bias-hidden-in-mortgage-approval-algorithms">lending companies</a> , <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-secures-settlement-race-discrimination-lawsuit-against-public-housing">housing authorities</a> , etc.—produce and replicate racial inequalities, such as the disproportionate killing of Black men by the cops. The second is a psychological<i> </i>concept that describes the way that all individuals—from bleeding-heart liberals to murderers such as Derek Chauvin—harbor varying degrees of subconscious racial prejudice.<br><br> Though “structural racism” and “implicit bias” target different scales of the social order—institutions on the one hand, individuals on the other—underlying both of these ideas is a critique of so-called color-blind ideology, or what the sociologist Eduardo Bonilla-Silva calls “color-blind racism”: the idea that policies, interactions, and rhetoric can be explicitly race-neutral but implicitly racist. As concepts, both “structural racism” and “implicit bias” rest on the presupposition that racism is an enduring feature of institutional and social life, and that so-called race neutrality is a covertly racist myth that perpetuates inequality. Some anti-racist scholars such as Uma Mazyck Jayakumar and Ibram X. Kendi have put this even more bluntly: <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/06/supreme-court-affirmative-action-race-neutral-admissions/674565/">“&#39;Race neutral&#39; is the new “separate but equal.&#39;”</a> Yet, although anti-racist academics and activists are <i>right</i> to argue that race-neutral policies can&#39;t solve racial inequities—that supposedly color-blind laws and policies <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/colorblind-constitution/602221/">are often anything but</a> —over the past few years, this line of criticism has also been bizarrely extended to color-blindness as a <i>personal</i> ethos governing behavior at the individual level.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/colorblind-constitution/602221/">Theodore R. Johnson: How conservatives turned the &#39;color-blind constitution&#39; against racial progress</a><br><br> The most famous proponent of dismantling color-blindness in everyday interactions is Robin DiAngelo, who has made an entire (very <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/07/dehumanizing-condescension-white-fragility/614146/">condescending</a> ) career out of asserting that if white people are not uncomfortable, anti-racism is not happening. “White comfort maintains the racial status quo, so discomfort is necessary and important,” the corporate anti-racist guru <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/white-fragility-why-it-s-so-hard-for-white-people-to-talk-about-racism-robin-diangelo/9780807047415?affiliate_id=atl-347">advises</a> . Over the past three years, this kind of anti-color-blind, pro-discomfort rhetoric has become the norm in anti-racist discourse. On the final day of the 28-day challenge in Layla Saad&#39;s viral <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blm.btown-in.org/uploads/1/1/8/6/118615243/me_and_white_supremacy_workbook__final_book_.pdf"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/me-and-white-supremacy-combat-racism-change-the-world-and-become-a-good-ancestor-layla-saad/9781728232430?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Me and White Supremacy</i></a> , budding anti-racists are tasked with taking “out-of-your-comfort-zone actions,” such as apologizing to people of color in their life and having “uncomfortable conversations.” Frederick Joseph&#39;s best-selling book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/17/books/review/frederick-joseph-the-black-friend.html"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-black-friend-on-being-a-better-white-person-frederick-joseph/9781536223040?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Black Friend</i></a> takes a similar tack. The problem with color-blindness, Joseph counsels, is it allows “white people to continue to be comfortable.” The NFL analyst Emmanuel Acho wrote an entire book, simply called <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/uncomfortable-conversations-with-a-black-man-emmanuel-acho/9781250800473?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Uncomfortable Conversations With a Black Man</i></a> , that admonishes readers to “stop celebrating color-blindness.” And, of course, there are endless <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.harpercollins.com/products/real-friends-talk-about-race-yseult-p-mukantabanahannah-summerhill?variant=40582692667426"> </a><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/real-friends-talk-about-race-bridging-the-gaps-through-uncomfortable-conversations-yseult-p-mukantabana/9780778387053?affiliate_id=atl-347">how-to guides</a> for having these “uncomfortable conversations” with <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://katiecouric.com/lifestyle/relationships/how-to-talk-about-racism/">your Black friends</a> .<br><br> Once the dominant progressive ideology, professing “I don&#39;t see color” is now viewed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danabrownlee/2022/06/19/dear-white-people-when-you-say-you-dont-see-color-this-is-what-we-really-hear/?sh=b4c50c726d60">as a kind of dog whistle</a> that papers over implicit bias. Instead, current anti-racist wisdom holds that we must acknowledge racial difference in our interactions with others, rather than assume that race needn&#39;t be at the center of every interracial conversation or encounter. Coming to grips with the transition we have undergone over the past decade—color-blind etiquette&#39;s swing from de rigueur to racist—requires a longer view of an American cultural transition. Civil-rights-era color-blindness was replaced with an individualistic, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hbr.org/2022/05/how-to-build-an-anti-racist-company">corporatized anti-racism</a> , one focused on the purification of white psyches through racial discomfort, guilt, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://harpers.org/archive/2023/07/protestant-ethic-and-the-spirit-of-wokeness/">“doing the work”</a> as a road to self-improvement.<br><br> Writing in 1959, the social critic Philip Rieff argued that postwar America was transforming from a religious and economic culture—one oriented around common institutions such as the church and the market—to a <i>psychological</i> culture, one oriented around the self and its emotional fulfillment. By the 1960s, Rieff had given this shift a <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Triumph-Therapeutic-Background-Essential-Conservative/dp/1932236805">name</a> : “the triumph of the therapeutic,” which he defined as an emergent worldview according to which the “self, improved, is the ultimate concern of modern culture.” Yet, even as he diagnosed our culture with self-obsession, Rieff also noticed something peculiar and even paradoxical. Therapeutic culture demanded that we reflect our self-actualization <i>outward</i> . Sharing our innermost selves with the world—good, bad, and ugly—became a new social mandate under the guise that authenticity and open self-expression are necessary for social cohesion.<br><br> Recent anti-racist mantras like “White silence is violence” reflect this same sentiment: exhibitionist displays of “racist” guilt are viewed as a necessary precursor to racial healing and community building. In this way, today&#39;s attacks on interpersonal color-blindness—and progressives&#39; growing fixation on implicit bias, public confession, and race-conscious social etiquette—are only the most recent manifestations of the cultural shift Rieff described. Indeed, the seeds of the current backlash against color-blindness began decades ago, with the application of a New Age, therapeutic outlook to race relations: so-called racial-sensitivity training, the forefather of today&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/07/antiracism-training-white-fragility-robin-diangelo-ibram-kendi.html">equally spurious</a> DEI programming.<br><br> In her 2001 book, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/race-experts-how-racial-etiquette-sensitivity-training-and-new-age-therapy-hijacked-the-civil-rights-revolution-elisabeth-lasch-quinn/9780742527591?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Race Experts</i></a> , the historian Elisabeth Lasch-Quinn painstakingly details how racial-sensitivity training emerged from the 1960s&#39; human-potential movement and its <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nytimes.com/1974/01/13/archives/encounter-movement-a-fad-last-decade-finds-new-shape-tried-by.html">infamous “encounter groups.”</a> As she explains, what began as a more or less countercultural phenomenon was <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cultural-comment/the-radical-history-of-corporate-sensitivity-training#:~:text=It%2520was%2520born%2520amid%2520the,fears%252C%2520biases%252C%2520and%2520emotions.">later corporatized</a> in the form of the anemic, pointless workshops <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.newsweek.com/comedy-central-caves-cancel-culture-removes-episode-office-line-1623873">controversially lampooned on <i>The Office</i></a> . Not surprisingly, this shift <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://ideas.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Anand-Winters-2008.pdf">reflected the ebb and flow of corporate interests</a> : Whereas early workplace training emphasized compliance with the newly minted Civil Rights Act of 1964, later incarnations would focus on improving employee relations and, later still, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://hbr.org/2022/06/stop-making-the-business-case-for-diversity">leveraging diversity</a> to secure <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/biancamillercole/2020/09/15/8-reasons-why-diversity-and-inclusion-are-essential-to-business-success/?sh=2c9d53581824">better business outcomes</a> .<br><br> If there is something distinctive about the anti-color-blind racial etiquette that has emerged since George Floyd&#39;s death, it is that these sites of encounter have shifted from official institutional spaces to more intimate ones where white people and minorities interact as friends, neighbors, colleagues, and acquaintances. Racial-awareness raising is a dynamic no longer quarantined to formalized, compulsory settings like the boardroom or <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2963111">freshman orientation</a> . Instead, every interracial interaction is a potential scene of (one-way) racial edification and supplication, encounters in which good white liberals are expected to be transparent about their “positionality,” confront their “whiteness,” and—if the situation calls for it—confess their “implicit bias.”<br><br> In a vacuum, many of the prescriptions advocated by the anti-color-blind crowd are reasonable: We <i>should</i> all think more about our privileges and our place in the world. An uncomfortable conversation or an honest look in the mirror <i>can be</i> precursors to personal growth. We <i>all</i> carry around harmful, implicit biases and we <i>do</i> need to examine the subconscious assumptions and prejudices that underlie the actions we take and the things we say. My objection is not to these ideas themselves, which are sensible enough. No, my objection is that anti-racism offers little more than a Marie Kondo–ism for the white soul, promising to declutter racial baggage and clear a way to white fulfillment without doing anything meaningful to combat structural racism. As Lasch-Quinn correctly foresaw, “Casting interracial problems as issues of etiquette [puts] a premium on superficial symbols of good intentions and good motivations as well as on style and appearance rather than on the substance of change.”<br><br> Yet the problem with the therapeutics of contemporary anti-racism is not just that <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.leftbusinessobserver.com/Antiracism.html">they are politically sterile</a> . When anti-color-blindness and its ideology of insistent “race consciousness” are translated into the sphere of private life—to the domain of friendships, block parties, and backyard barbecues—they assault the very idea of a multiracial society, producing new forms of racism in the process. The fact that our media environment is inundated with an endless stream of books, articles, and social-media tutorials that promise to teach white people how to simply <i>interact</i> with the Black people in their life is not a sign of anti-racist progress, but of profound regression.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/05/dei-training-initiatives-consultants-companies-skepticism/674237/">Conor Friedersdorf: The DEI industry needs to check its privilege</a><br><br> The subtext that undergirds this new anti-racist discourse—that Black-white relationships are inherently fraught and must be navigated with the help of professionals and technical experts—testifies to the impoverishment of our interracial imagination, not to its enrichment. More gravely, anti-color-blind etiquette treats Black Americans as exotic others, permanent strangers whose racial difference is so chasmic that it must be continually managed, whose mode of humanness is so foreign that it requires white people to adopt a special set of manners and “race conscious” ritualistic practices to even have a simple conversation.<br><br> If we are going to find a way out of the racial discord that has defined American life post-Trump and post-Charlottesville and post-Floyd, we have to begin with a more sophisticated understanding of color-blindness, one that rejects the bad color-blindness on offer from the Republican Party and its partisans, as well as the <i>anti</i> -color-blindness of the anti-racist consultants. Instead, we should embrace the good color-blindness of not too long ago. At the heart of <i>that</i> color-blindness was a radical claim, one imperfectly realized but perfect as an ideal: that despite the weight of <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88478467">a racist past that isn&#39;t even past</a> , we can imagine a world, or at least an interaction between two people, where racial difference doesn&#39;t make a difference.<br><br></div> ]]>;</description><pubDate> Mon, 14 Aug 2023 11:00:00 GMT</pubDate><guid ispermalink="false"> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/anti-racist-color-blindness-dei-programs/674996/</guid><link/> https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/08/anti-racist-color-blindness-dei-programs/674996/ </item><item><title><![CDATA[How America Got Mean]]></title><description><![CDATA[<div> In a culture devoid of moral education, generations are growing up in a morally inarticulate, self-referential world. <br><figure><img src="https://cdn.theatlantic.com/thumbor/ErwHrDisYTvej8Qd9FpdaGlQsAI=/0x157:3000x1845/1440x810/media/img/2023/07/24/0923_WEL_Brooks_MoralCollapseOpener/original.jpg" alt="镜子碎片排列成美国的形状，倒映着一棵树和天空" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"><figcaption></figcaption></figure> <small><i data-stringify-type="italic">This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from</i> The Atlantic <i data-stringify-type="italic">, Monday through Friday.</i> <i data-stringify-type="italic"><a data-event-element="inline link" data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" delay="150" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/sign-up/one-story-to-read-today/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Sign up for it here.</a></i></small><br><br> O <span class="smallcaps">ver the past</span> eight years or so, I&#39;ve been obsessed with two questions. The first is: Why have Americans become so sad? The rising rates of depression have been well publicized, as have the rising deaths of despair from drugs, alcohol, and suicide. But other statistics are similarly troubling. The percentage of people who say they don&#39;t have close friends has increased fourfold since 1990. The share of Americans ages 25 to 54 who weren&#39;t married or living with a romantic partner went up to 38 percent in 2019, from 29 percent in 1990. A record-high 25 percent of 40-year-old Americans <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2023/06/28/a-record-high-share-of-40-year-olds-in-the-us-have-never-been-married/">have never married</a> . More than half of all Americans say that no one knows them well. The percentage of high-school students who report “persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness” shot up from 26 percent in 2009 to 44 percent in 2021.<br><br> My second, related question is: Why have Americans become so mean? I was recently talking with a restaurant owner who said that he has to eject a customer from his restaurant for rude or cruel behavior once a week—something that never used to happen. A head nurse at a hospital told me that many on her staff are leaving the profession because patients have become so abusive. At the far extreme of meanness, hate crimes rose in 2020 to their highest level in 12 years. Murder rates have been surging, at least until recently. Same with gun sales. Social trust is plummeting. In 2000, two-thirds of American households gave to charity; in 2018, fewer than half did. The words that define our age reek of menace: <i>conspiracy</i> , <i>polarization</i> , <i>mass shootings</i> , <i>trauma</i> , <i>safe spaces</i> .<br><br> We&#39;re enmeshed in some sort of emotional, relational, and spiritual crisis, and it undergirds our political dysfunction and the general crisis of our democracy.到底是怎么回事？<br><br> Over the past few years, different social observers have offered different stories to explain the rise of hatred, anxiety, and despair.<br><br> <i>The technology story:</i> Social media is driving us all crazy.<br><br> <i>The sociology story:</i> We&#39;ve stopped participating in community organizations and are more isolated.<br><br> <i>The demography story:</i> America, long a white-dominated nation, is becoming a much more diverse country, a change that has millions of white Americans in a panic.<br><br> <i>The economy story:</i> High levels of economic inequality and insecurity have left people afraid, alienated, and pessimistic.<br><br> I agree, to an extent, with all of these stories, but I don&#39;t think any of them is the deepest one. Sure, social media has bad effects, but it is everywhere around the globe—and the mental-health crisis is not. Also, the rise of despair and hatred has engulfed a lot of people who are not on social media. Economic inequality is real, but it doesn&#39;t fully explain this level of social and emotional breakdown. The sociologists are right that we&#39;re more isolated, but why? What values lead us to choose lifestyles that make us lonely and miserable?<br><br> The most important story about why Americans have become sad and alienated and rude, I believe, is also the simplest: We inhabit a society in which people are no longer trained in how to treat others with kindness and consideration. Our society has become one in which people feel licensed to give their selfishness free rein. The story I&#39;m going to tell is about morals. In a healthy society, a web of institutions—families, schools, religious groups, community organizations, and workplaces—helps form people into kind and responsible citizens, the sort of people who show up for one another. We live in a society that&#39;s terrible at moral formation.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/pandemic-american-shoppers-nightmare/619650/">Read: American shoppers are a nightmare</a><br><br> Moral formation, as I will use that stuffy-sounding term here, comprises three things. First, helping people learn to restrain their selfishness. How do we keep our evolutionarily conferred egotism under control? Second, teaching basic social and ethical skills. How do you welcome a neighbor into your community? How do you disagree with someone constructively? And third, helping people find a purpose in life. Morally formative institutions hold up a set of ideals. They provide practical pathways toward a meaningful existence: <i>Here&#39;s how you can dedicate your life to serving the poor, or protecting the nation, or loving your neighbor.</i><br><br> For a large part of its history, America was awash in morally formative institutions. Its Founding Fathers had a low view of human nature, and <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://guides.loc.gov/federalist-papers/text-51-60">designed the Constitution to mitigate it</a> (even while validating that low view of human nature by producing a document rife with racism and sexism). “Men I find to be a Sort of Beings very badly constructed,” <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Franklin/01-37-02-0277">Benjamin Franklin wrote</a> , “as they are generally more easily provok&#39;d than reconcil&#39;d, more dispos&#39;d to do Mischief to each other than to make Reparation, and much more easily deceiv&#39;d than undeceiv&#39;d.”<br><br> If such flawed, self-centered creatures were going to govern themselves and be decent neighbors to one another, they were going to need some training. For roughly 150 years after the founding, Americans were obsessed with moral education. In 1788, Noah Webster wrote, “The <i>virtues</i> of men are of more consequence to society than their <i>abilities</i> ; and for this reason, the <i>heart</i> should be cultivated with more assiduity than the <i>head</i> .” The progressive philosopher John Dewey wrote in 1909 that schools teach morality “every moment of the day, five days a week.” Hollis Frissell, the president of the Hampton Institute, an early school for African Americans, declared, “Character is the main object of education.” As late as 1951, a commission organized by the National Education Association, one of the main teachers&#39; unions, stated that “an unremitting concern for moral and spiritual values continues to be a top priority for education.”<br><br> The moral-education programs that stippled the cultural landscape during this long stretch of history came from all points on the political and religious spectrums. School textbooks such as <i>McGuffey&#39;s Eclectic Readers</i> not only taught students how to read and write; they taught etiquette, and featured stories designed to illustrate right and wrong behavior. In the 1920s, WEB Du Bois&#39;s <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://blogs.loc.gov/loc/2022/08/w-e-b-dubois-and-the-brownies-book/">magazine for Black children</a> , <i>The Brownies&#39; Book</i> , had a regular column called “The Judge,” which provided guidance to young readers on morals and manners. There were thriving school organizations with morally earnest names that sound quaint today—the Courtesy Club, the Thrift Club, the Knighthood of Youth.<br><br> Beyond the classroom lay a host of other groups: the YMCA; the Sunday-school movement; the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts; the settlement-house movement, which brought rich and poor together to serve the marginalized; Aldo Leopold&#39;s land ethic, which extended our moral concerns to include proper care for the natural world; professional organizations, which enforced ethical codes; unions and workplace associations, which, in addition to enhancing worker protections and paychecks, held up certain standards of working-class respectability. And of course, by the late 19th century, many Americans were members of churches or other religious communities. Mere religious faith doesn&#39;t always make people morally good, but living in a community, orienting your heart toward some transcendent love, basing your value system on concern for the underserved—those things tend to.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/04/kindness-happiness-negative-feedback/673862/">Arthur C. Brooks: Make yourself happy—be kind</a><br><br> An educational approach with German roots that was adopted by Scandinavian societies in the mid-to-late 19th century had a wide influence on America. It was called <i>Bildung</i> , roughly meaning “spiritual formation.” As conceived by Wilhelm von Humboldt, the <i>Bildung</i> approach gave professors complete freedom to put moral development at the center of a university&#39;s mission. In schools across Scandinavia, students studied literature and folk cultures to identify their own emotions, wounds, and weaknesses, in order to become the complex human beings that modern society required. Schools in the <i>Bildung</i> tradition also aimed to clarify the individual&#39;s responsibilities to the wider world—family, friends, nation, humanity. Start with the soul and move outward.<br><br> The <i>Bildung</i> movement helped inspire the Great Books programs that popped up at places like Columbia and the University of Chicago. They were based on the conviction that reading the major works of world literature and thinking about them deeply would provide the keys to living a richer life. Meanwhile, discipline in the small proprieties of daily existence—dressing formally, even just to go shopping or to a ball game—was considered evidence of uprightness: proof that you were a person who could be counted on when the large challenges came.<br><br> Much of American moral education drew on an ethos expressed by the headmaster of the Stowe School, in England, who wrote in 1930 that the purpose of his institution was to turn out young men who were “acceptable at a dance and invaluable in a shipwreck.” America&#39;s National Institute for Moral Instruction was founded in 1911 and published a “Children&#39;s Morality Code,” with 10 rules for right living. At the turn of the 20th century, Mount Holyoke College, an all-women&#39;s institution, was an example of an intentionally thick moral community. When a young Frances Perkins was a student there, her Latin teacher detected a certain laziness in her. She forced Perkins to spend hours conjugating Latin verbs, to cultivate self-discipline. Perkins grew to appreciate this: “For the first time I became conscious of character.” The school also called upon women to follow morally ambitious paths. “Do what nobody else wants to do; go where nobody else wants to go,” the school&#39;s founder implored. Holyoke launched women into lives of service in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East. Perkins, who would become the first woman to serve in a presidential Cabinet (Franklin D. Roosevelt&#39;s), was galvanized there.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2016/07/students-broken-moral-compasses/492866/">Read: Students&#39; broken moral compasses</a><br><br> These various approaches to moral formation shared two premises. The first was that training the heart and body is more important than training the reasoning brain. Some moral skills can be taught the way academic subjects are imparted, through books and lectures. But we learn most virtues the way we learn crafts, through the repetition of many small habits and practices, all within a coherent moral culture—a community of common values, whose members aspire to earn one another&#39;s respect.<br><br> The other guiding premise was that concepts like justice and right and wrong are not matters of personal taste: An objective moral order exists, and human beings are creatures who habitually sin against that order. This recognition was central, for example, to the way the civil-rights movement in the 1950s and early 1960s thought about character formation. “Instead of assured progress in wisdom and decency man faces the ever present possibility of swift relapse not merely to animalism but into such calculated cruelty as no other animal can practice,” Martin Luther King Jr. believed. Elsewhere, he wrote, “The force of sinfulness is so stubborn a characteristic of human nature that it can only be restrained when the social unit is armed with both moral and physical might.”<br><br> At their best, the civil-rights marchers in this prophetic tradition understood that they could become corrupted even while serving a noble cause. They could become self-righteous because their cause was just, hardened by hatred of their opponents, prideful as they asserted power. King&#39;s strategy of nonviolence was an effort simultaneously to expose the sins of their oppressors and to restrain the sinful tendencies inherent in themselves. “What gave such widely compelling force to King&#39;s leadership and oratory,” the historian George Marsden argues, “was his bedrock conviction that moral law was built into the universe.”<br><br> A couple of obvious things need to be said about this ethos of moral formation that dominated American life for so long. It prevailed alongside all sorts of hierarchies that we now rightly find abhorrent: whites superior to Blacks, men to women, Christians to Jews, straight people to gay people. And the emphasis on morality didn&#39;t produce perfect people. Moral formation doesn&#39;t succeed in making people angels—it tries to make them better than they otherwise might be.<br><br> Furthermore, we would never want to go back to the training methods that prevailed for so long, rooted in so many <i>thou shall not</i> s and so much shaming, and riddled with so much racism and sexism. Yet a wise accounting should acknowledge that emphasizing moral formation meant focusing on an important question—what is life for?—and teaching people how to bear up under inevitable difficulties. A culture invested in shaping character helped make people resilient by giving them ideals to cling to when times got hard. In some ways, the old approach to moral formation was, at least theoretically, egalitarian: If your status in the community was based on character and reputation, then a farmer could earn dignity as readily as a banker. This ethos came down hard on self-centeredness and narcissistic display. It offered practical guidance on how to be a good neighbor, a good friend.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">And then</span> it mostly went away.<br><br> The crucial pivot happened just after World War II, as people wrestled with the horrors of the 20th century. One group, personified by the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, argued that recent events had exposed the prevalence of human depravity and the dangers, in particular, of tribalism, nationalism, and collective pride. This group wanted to double down on moral formation, with a greater emphasis on humility.<br><br> Another group, personified by Carl Rogers, a founder of humanistic psychology, focused on the problem of authority. The trouble with the 20th century, the members of this group argued, was that the existence of rigid power hierarchies led to oppression in many spheres of life. We need to liberate individuals from these authority structures, many contended. People are naturally good and can be trusted to do their own self-actualization.<br><br> After decades without much in the way of moral formation, America became a place where 74 million people looked at Donald Trump&#39;s morality and saw presidential timber.<br><br> A cluster of phenomenally successful books appeared in the decade after World War II, making the case that, as Rabbi Joshua Loth Liebman wrote in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/peace-of-mind-insights-on-human-nature-that-can-change-your-life-joshua-l-liebman/9780806514963?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Peace of Mind</i></a> (1946), “thou shalt not be afraid of thy hidden impulses.” People can trust the goodness inside. His book topped the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list for 58 weeks. Dr. Spock&#39;s first child-rearing manual was published the same year. That was followed by books like <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-power-of-positive-thinking-10-traits-for-maximum-results-norman-vincent-peale/9780743234801?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Power of Positive Thinking</i></a> (1952). According to this ethos, morality is not something that we develop in communities. It&#39;s nurtured by connecting with our authentic self and finding our true inner voice. If people are naturally good, we don&#39;t need moral formation; we just need to let people get in touch with themselves. Organization after organization got out of the moral-formation business and into the self-awareness business. By the mid‑1970s, for example, the Girl Scouts&#39; founding ethos of service to others had shifted: “How can you get more in touch with <i>you</i> ? What are <i>you</i> thinking? What are <i>you</i> feeling?” one Girl Scout handbook asked.<br><br> Schools began to abandon moral formation in the 1940s and &#39;50s, as the education historian B. Edward McClellan chronicles in <i><a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/moral-education-in-america-schools-and-the-shaping-of-character-from-colonial-times-to-the-present-b-edward-mcclellan/9780807738207?affiliate_id=atl-347">Moral Education in America</a></i> : “By the 1960s deliberate moral education was in full-scale retreat” as educators “paid more attention to the SAT scores of their students, and middle-class parents scrambled to find schools that would give their children the best chances to qualify for elite colleges and universities.” The postwar period saw similar change at the college level, Anthony Kronman, a former dean of Yale Law School, has noted. The “research ideal” supplanted the earlier humanistic ideal of cultivating the whole student. As academics grew more specialized, Kronman has argued, the big questions—What is the meaning of life? How do you live a good life?—lost all purchase. Such questions became unprofessional for an academic to even ask.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/05/the-benefits-of-character-education/275585/">Read: The benefits of character education</a><br><br> In sphere after sphere, people decided that moral reasoning was not really relevant. Psychology&#39;s purview grew, especially in family and educational matters, its vocabulary framing “virtually all public discussion” of the moral life of children, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/storage/app/uploads/public/58e/1a4/f58/58e1a4f58adfb826575976.pdf">James Davison Hunter, a prominent American scholar on character education, noted in 2000</a> . “For decades now, contributions from philosophers and theologians have been muted or nonexistent.” Psychology is a wonderful profession, but its goal is mental health, not moral growth.<br><br> From the start, some worried about this privatizing of morality. “If what is good, what is right, what is true is only what the individual &#39;chooses&#39; to &#39;invent,&#39; ” Walter Lippmann wrote in his 1955 collection, <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-public-philosophy-walter-lippmann/9780887387913?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>Essays in the Public Philosophy</i></a> , “then we are outside the traditions of civility.” His book was hooted down by establishment figures such as the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr.; the de-moralization of American culture was under way.<br><br> Over the course of the 20th century, words relating to morality appeared less and less frequently in the nation&#39;s books: According to a 2012 paper, usage of a cluster of words related to being virtuous also declined significantly. Among them were <i>bravery</i> (which dropped by 65 percent), <i>gratitude</i> (58 percent), and <i>humbleness</i> (55 percent). For decades, researchers have asked incoming college students about their goals in life. In 1967, about 85 percent said they were strongly motivated to develop “a meaningful philosophy of life”; <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.heri.ucla.edu/PDFs/pubs/TFS/Norms/Monographs/TheAmericanFreshman2000.pdf">by 2000, only 42 percent said that</a> . Being financially well off became the leading life goal; by 2015, 82 percent of students said wealth was their aim.<br><br> In a culture devoid of moral education, generations grow up in a morally inarticulate, self-referential world. The Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith and a team of researchers asked young adults across the country in 2008 about their moral lives. One of their findings was that the interviewees had not given the subject of morality much thought. “I&#39;ve never had to make a decision about what&#39;s right and what&#39;s wrong,” one young adult told the researchers. “My teachers avoid controversies like that like the plague,” many teenagers said.<br><br> The moral instincts that Smith observed in his sample fell into the pattern that the philosopher Alasdair MacIntyre called “emotivism”: <i>Whatever feels good to me is moral.</i> “I would probably do what would make me happy” in any given situation <b>,</b> one of the interviewees declared. “Because it&#39;s me in the long run.” As another put it, “If you&#39;re okay with it morally, as long as you&#39;re not getting caught, then it&#39;s not really against your morals, is it?” Smith and his colleagues emphasized that the interviewees were not bad people but, because they were living “in morally very thin or spotty worlds,” they had never been given a moral vocabulary or learned moral skills.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Most of us</span> who noticed the process of de-moralization as it was occurring thought a bland moral relativism and empty consumerism would be the result: <i>You do you and I&#39;ll do me.</i> That&#39;s not what happened.<br><br> “Moral communities are fragile things, hard to build and easy to destroy,” the psychologist Jonathan Haidt writes in <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-righteous-mind-why-good-people-are-divided-by-politics-and-religion-jonathan-haidt/9780307455772?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Righteous Mind</i></a> . When you are raised in a culture without ethical structure, you become internally fragile. You have no moral compass to give you direction, no permanent ideals to which you can swear ultimate allegiance. “He who has a <i>why</i> to live for can bear with almost any <i>how</i> ,” the psychiatrist (and Holocaust survivor) Viktor Frankl wrote, interpreting a famous Nietzsche saying. Those without a <i>why</i> fall apart when the storms hit. They begin to suffer from that feeling of moral emptiness that Émile Durkheim called “anomie.”<br><br> Expecting people to build a satisfying moral and spiritual life on their own by looking within themselves is asking too much. A culture that leaves people morally naked and alone leaves them without the skills to be decent to one another. Social trust falls partly because more people are untrustworthy. That creates crowds of what psychologists call “vulnerable narcissists.” We all know grandiose narcissists—people who revere themselves as the center of the universe. Vulnerable narcissists are the more common figures in our day—people who are also addicted to thinking about themselves, but who often feel anxious, insecure, avoidant. Intensely sensitive to rejection, they scan for hints of disrespect. Their self-esteem is wildly in flux. Their uncertainty about their inner worth triggers cycles of distrust, shame, and hostility.<br><br> “The breakdown of an enduring moral framework will always produce disconnection, alienation, and an estrangement from those around you,” Luke Bretherton, a theologian at Duke Divinity School, told me. The result is the kind of sadness I see in the people around me. Young adults I know are spiraling, leaving school, moving from one mental-health facility to another. After a talk I gave in Oklahoma, a woman asked me, “What do you do when you no longer want to be alive?” The very next night I had dinner with a woman who told me that her brother had died by suicide three months before. I mentioned these events to a group of friends on a Zoom call, and nearly half of them said they&#39;d had a brush with suicide in their family. Statistics paint the broader picture: Suicide rates have <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.cdc.gov/suicide/facts/index.html">increased by more than 30 percent</a> since 2000, according to the CDC.<br><br> Sadness, loneliness, and self-harm turn into bitterness. Social pain is ultimately a response to a sense of rejection—of being invisible, unheard, disrespected, victimized. When people feel that their identity is unrecognized, the experience registers as an injustice—because it is. People who have been treated unjustly often lash out and seek ways to humiliate those who they believe have humiliated them.<br><br> Even as our public life has grown morally bare, people yearn to feel respected and worthy of respect, need to feel that their life has some moral purpose and meaning.<br><br> Lonely eras are not just sad eras; they are violent ones. In 19th-century America, when a lot of lonely young men were crossing the western frontier, one of the things they tended to do was shoot one another. As the saying goes, pain that is not transformed gets transmitted. People grow more callous, defensive, distrustful, and hostile. The pandemic made it worse, but antisocial behavior is still high even though the lockdowns are over. And now we are caught in a cycle, ill treatment leading to humiliation and humiliation leading to more meanness. Social life becomes more barbaric, online and off.<br><br> If you put people in a moral vacuum, they will seek to fill it with the closest thing at hand. Over the past several years, people have sought to <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/collapsing-levels-trust-are-devastating-america/616581/">fill the moral vacuum</a> with politics and tribalism. American society has become hyper-politicized.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/10/collapsing-levels-trust-are-devastating-america/616581/">David Brooks: America is having a moral convulsion</a><br><br> According to research by Ryan Streeter, the director of domestic-policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, lonely young people are seven times more likely to say they are active in politics than young people who aren&#39;t lonely. For people who feel disrespected, unseen, and alone, politics is a seductive form of social therapy. It offers them a comprehensible moral landscape: The line between good and evil runs not down the middle of every human heart, but between groups. Life is a struggle between us, the forces of good, and them, the forces of evil.<br><br> The Manichaean tribalism of politics appears to give people a sense of belonging. For many years, America seemed to be awash in a culture of hyper-individualism. But these days, people are quick to identify themselves by their group: Republican, Democrat, evangelical, person of color, LGBTQ, southerner, patriot, progressive, conservative. People who feel isolated and under threat flee to totalizing identities.<br><br> Politics appears to give people a sense of righteousness: A person&#39;s moral stature is based not on their conduct, but on their location on the political spectrum. You don&#39;t have to be good; you just have to be liberal—or you just have to be conservative. The stronger a group&#39;s claim to victim status, the more virtuous it is assumed to be, and the more secure its members can feel about their own innocence.<br><br> Politics also provides an easy way to feel a sense of purpose. You don&#39;t have to feed the hungry or sit with the widow to be moral; you just have to experience the right emotion. You delude yourself that you are participating in civic life by feeling properly enraged at the other side. That righteous fury rising in your gut lets you know that you are engaged in caring about this country. The culture war is a struggle that gives life meaning.<br><br> Politics overwhelms everything. Churches, universities, sports, pop culture, health care are swept up in a succession of battles that are really just one big war—red versus blue. Evangelicalism used to be a faith; today it&#39;s primarily a political identity. College humanities departments used to study literature and history to plumb the human heart and mind; now they sometimes seem exclusively preoccupied with politics, and with the oppressive systems built around race, class, and gender. Late-night comedy shows have become political pep rallies. Hundreds of thousands of Americans died unnecessarily during the pandemic because people saw a virus through the lens of a political struggle.<br><br> This is not politics as it is normally understood. In psychically healthy societies, people fight over the politics of distribution: How high should taxes be? How much money should go to social programs for the poor and the elderly? We&#39;ve shifted focus from the politics of redistribution to the politics of recognition. Political movements are fueled by resentment, by feelings that society does not respect or recognize me. Political and media personalities gin up dramas in which our side is emotionally validated and the other side is emotionally shamed. The person practicing the politics of recognition is not trying to get resources for himself or his constituency; he is trying to admire himself. He&#39;s trying to use politics to fill the hole in his soul. It doesn&#39;t work.<br><br> The politics of recognition doesn&#39;t give you community and connection, certainly not in a system like our current one, mired in structural dysfunction. People join partisan tribes in search of belonging—but they end up in a lonely mob of isolated belligerents who merely obey the same orthodoxy.<br><br> If you are asking politics to be the reigning source of meaning in your life, you are asking more of politics than it can bear. Seeking to escape sadness, loneliness, and anomie through politics serves only to drop you into a world marked by fear and rage, by a sadistic striving for domination. Sure, you&#39;ve left the moral vacuum—but you&#39;ve landed in the pulverizing destructiveness of moral war. The politics of recognition has not produced a happy society. When asked by the General Social Survey to rate their happiness level, 20 percent of Americans in 2022 <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://gssdataexplorer.norc.org/trends?category=Gender%20%26%20Marriage&amp;measure=happy">rated it at the lowest level</a> —only 8 percent did the same in 1990.<br><br> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/">Read: What the longest study on human happiness found is the key to a good life</a><br><br> America&#39;s Founding Fathers studied the history of democracies going back to ancient Greece. They drew the lesson that democracies can be quite fragile. When private virtue fails, the constitutional order crumbles. After decades without much in the way of moral formation, America became a place where more than 74 million people looked at Donald Trump&#39;s morality and saw presidential timber.<br><br> <span class="smallcaps">Even in dark times,</span> sparks of renewal appear. In 2018, a documentary about Mister Rogers called <i>Won&#39;t You Be My Neighbor?</i> was released. The film showed <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2019/12/what-would-mister-rogers-do/600772/">Fred Rogers in all his simple goodness</a> —his small acts of generosity; his displays of vulnerability; his respect, even reverence, for each child he encountered. People cried openly while watching it in theaters. In an age of conflict and threat, the sight of radical goodness was so moving.<br><br> In the summer of 2020, the series <i>Ted Lasso</i> premiered. When Lasso describes his goals as a soccer coach, he could mention the championships he hopes to win or some other conventional metric of success, but he says, “For me, success is not about the wins and losses. It&#39;s about helping these young fellas be the best versions of themselves on and off the field.”<br><br> That is a two-sentence description of moral formation. <i>Ted Lasso</i> is about an earnest, cheerful, and transparently kind man who enters a world that has grown cynical, amoral, and manipulative, and, episode after episode, even through his own troubles, he offers the people around him opportunities to grow more gracious, to confront their vulnerabilities and fears, and to treat one another more gently and wisely. Amid lockdowns and political rancor, it became a cultural touchstone, and the most watched show on Apple TV+.<br><br> Even as our public life has grown morally bare, people, as part of their elemental nature, yearn to feel respected and worthy of respect, need to feel that their life has some moral purpose and meaning. People still want to build a society in which it is easier to be good. So the questions before us are pretty simple: How can we build morally formative institutions that are right for the 21st century? What do we need to do to build a culture that helps people become the best versions of themselves?<br><br> Healthy moral ecologies don&#39;t just happen. They have to be seeded and tended.<br><br> A few necessities come immediately to mind.<br><br> <i>A modern vision of how to build character.</i> The old-fashioned models of character-building were hopelessly gendered. Men were supposed to display iron willpower that would help them achieve self-mastery over their unruly passions. Women were to sequester themselves in a world of ladylike gentility in order to not be corrupted by bad influences and base desires. Those formulas are obsolete today.<br><br> The best modern approach to building character is described in Iris Murdoch&#39;s book <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://tertulia.com/book/the-sovereignty-of-good-iris-murdoch/9780415854733?affiliate_id=atl-347"><i>The Sovereignty of Good</i></a> . Murdoch writes that “nothing in life is of any value except the attempt to be virtuous.” For her, moral life is not defined merely by great deeds of courage or sacrifice in epic moments. Instead, moral life is something that goes on continually—treating people considerately in the complex situations of daily existence. For her, the essential moral act is casting a “just and loving” attention on other people.<br><br> Normally, she argues, we go about our days with self-centered, self-serving eyes. We see and judge people in ways that satisfy our own ego. We diminish and stereotype and ignore, reducing other people to bit players in our own all-consuming personal drama. But we become morally better, she continues, as we learn to see others deeply, as we learn to envelop others in the kind of patient, caring regard that makes them feel seen, heard, and understood. This is the kind of attention that implicitly asks, “What are you going through?” and cares about the answer.<br><br> I become a better person as I become more curious about those around me, as I become more skilled in seeing from their point of view. As I learn to perceive you with a patient and loving regard, I will tend to treat you well. We can, Murdoch concluded, “grow by looking.”<br><br> <i>Mandatory social-skills courses.</i> Murdoch&#39;s character-building formula roots us in the simple act of paying attention: <i>Do I attend to you well?</i> It also emphasizes that character is formed and displayed as we treat others considerately. This requires not just a good heart, but good social skills: how to listen well. How to disagree with respect. How to ask for and offer forgiveness. How to patiently cultivate a friendship. How to sit with someone who is grieving or depressed. How to be a good conversationalist.<br><br> These are some of the most important skills a person can have. And yet somehow, we don&#39;t teach them. Our schools spend years prepping students with professional skills—but offer little guidance on how to be an upstanding person in everyday life. If we&#39;re going to build a decent society, elementary schools and high schools should require students to take courses that teach these specific social skills, and thus prepare them for life with one another. We could have courses in how to be a good listener or how to build a friendship. The late feminist philosopher Nel Noddings <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://stanfordmag.org/contents/she-brought-caring-to-education-research">developed a whole pedagogy</a> around how to effectively care for others.<br><br> <i>A new core curriculum.</i> More and more colleges and universities are offering courses in what you might call “How to Live.” Yale has one called “Life Worth Living.” Notre Dame has one called “God and the Good Life.” A first-year honors program in this vein at Valparaiso University, in Indiana, involves not just conducting formal debates on ideas gleaned from the Great Books, but putting on a musical production based on their themes. Many of these courses don&#39;t give students a ready-made formula, but they introduce students to some of the venerated moral traditions—Buddhism, Judeo-Christianity, and Enlightenment rationalism, among others. They introduce students to those thinkers who have thought hard on moral problems, from Aristotle to Desmond Tutu to Martha Nussbaum. They hold up diverse exemplars to serve as models of how to live well. They put the big questions of life firmly on the table: <i>What is the ruling passion of your soul? Whom are you responsible to? What are my moral obligations? What will it take for my life to be meaningful? What does it mean to be a good human in today&#39;s world? What are the central issues we need to engage with concerning new technology and human life?</i><br><br> These questions clash with the ethos of the modern university, which is built around specialization and passing on professional or technical knowledge. But they are the most important courses a college can offer. They shouldn&#39;t be on the margins of academic life. They should be part of the required core curriculum.<br><br> <i>Intergenerational service.</i> We spend most of our lives living by the logic of the meritocracy: Life is an individual climb upward toward success. It&#39;s about pursuing self-interest.<br><br> There should be at least two periods of life when people have a chance to take a sabbatical from the meritocracy and live by an alternative logic—the logic of service: You have to give to receive. You have to lose yourself in a common cause to find yourself. The deepest human relationships are gift relationships, based on mutual care. (An obvious model for at least some aspects of this is the culture of the US military, which similarly emphasizes honor, service, selflessness, and character in support of a purpose greater than oneself, throwing together Americans of different ages and backgrounds who forge strong social bonds.)<br><br> Those sabbaticals could happen at the end of the school years and at the end of the working years. National service programs could bring younger and older people together to work to address community needs.<br><br> These programs would allow people to experience other-centered ways of being and develop practical moral habits: how to cooperate with people unlike you. How to show up day after day when progress is slow. How to do work that is generous and hard.<br><br> <i>Moral organizations.</i> Most organizations serve two sets of goals—moral goals and instrumental goals. Hospitals heal the sick and also seek to make money. Newspapers and magazines inform the public and also try to generate clicks. Law firms defend clients and also try to maximize billable hours. Nonprofits aim to serve the public good and also raise money.<br><br> In our society, the commercial or utilitarian goals tend to eclipse the moral goals. Doctors are pressured by hospital administrators to rush through patients so they can charge more fees. Journalists are incentivized to write stories that confirm reader prejudices in order to climb the most-read lists. Whole companies slip into an optimization mindset, in which everything is done to increase output and efficiency.<br><br> Moral renewal won&#39;t come until we have leaders who are explicit, loud, and credible about both sets of goals. <i>Here&#39;s how we&#39;re growing financially</i> , but also <i>Here&#39;s how we&#39;re learning to treat one another with consideration and respect; here&#39;s how we&#39;re going to forgo some financial returns in order to better serve our higher mission</i> .<br><br> Early in my career, as a TV pundit at <i>PBS NewsHour</i> , I worked with its host, Jim Lehrer. Every day, with a series of small gestures, he signaled what kind of behavior was valued there and what kind of behavior was unacceptable. In this subtle way, he established a set of norms and practices that still lives on. He and others built a thick and coherent moral ecology, and its way of being was internalized by most of the people who have worked there.<br><br> <i>Politics as a moral enterprise.</i> An ancient brand of amoralism now haunts the world. Authoritarian-style leaders like Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Xi Jinping embody a kind of amoral realism. They evince a mindset that assumes that the world is a vicious, dog-eat-dog sort of place. Life is a competition to grab what you can. Force is what matters. Morality is a luxury we cannot afford, or merely a sham that elites use to mask their own lust for power. It&#39;s fine to elect people who lie, who are corrupt, as long as they are ruthless bastards for our side. The ends justify the means.<br><br> Those of us who oppose these authoritarians stand, by contrast, for a philosophy of moral realism. Yes, of course people are selfish and life can be harsh. But over the centuries, civilizations have established rules and codes to nurture cooperation, to build trust and sweeten our condition. These include personal moral codes so we know how to treat one another well, ethical codes to help prevent corruption on the job and in public life, and the rules of the liberal world order so that nations can live in peace, secure within their borders.<br><br> Moral realists are fighting to defend and modernize these rules and standards—these sinews of civilization. Moral realism is built on certain core principles. Character is destiny. We can either elect people who try to embody the highest standards of honesty, kindness, and integrity, or elect people who shred those standards. Statecraft is soulcraft. The laws we pass shape the kinds of people we become. We can structure our tax code to encourage people to be enterprising and to save more, or we can structure the code to encourage people to be conniving and profligate. Democracy is the system that best enhances human dignity. Democratic regimes entrust power to the people, and try to form people so they will be responsible with that trust. Authoritarian regimes seek to create a world in which the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.<br><br> Look, I understand why people don&#39;t want to get all moralistic in public. Many of those who do are self-righteous prigs, or rank hypocrites. And all of this is only a start. But healthy moral ecologies don&#39;t just happen. They have to be seeded and tended by people who think and talk in moral terms, who try to model and inculcate moral behavior, who understand that we have to build moral communities because on our own, we are all selfish and flawed. Moral formation is best when it&#39;s humble. It means giving people the skills and habits that will help them be considerate to others in the complex situations of life. It means helping people behave in ways that make other people feel included, seen, and respected. That&#39;s very different from how we treat people now—in ways that make them feel sad and lonely, and that make them grow unkind.<br><br> <small><i>This article appears in the</i> <a data-event-element="inline link" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/toc/2023/09"><i>September 2023</i></a> <i>print edition with the headline “How America Got Mean.” When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.
